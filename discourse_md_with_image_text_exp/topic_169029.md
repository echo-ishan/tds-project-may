If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

### Post #9 by **B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA** on *March 03, 2025*
Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?

If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.

Thanks and Regards

### Post #23 by **Vivek Rekha Ashoka** on *March 03, 2025*
There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).  
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:  
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?

Some other doubts are

1. Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
2. Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
3. Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
4. Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)

How do we account for this? @Jivraj @s.anand @carlton

### Post #24 by **Vinil** on *March 03, 2025*
I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.

1. Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one?
2. Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
3. Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
4. If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
5. Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?

awaiting a response.

Thank you…

### Post #28 by **PREMDEEP MAITI** on *March 05, 2025*
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Dear Sir,  
I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.

1. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.  
   But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
2. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?  
   Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.
3. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.
4. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?
5. Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?
6. And many more

Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.  
Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.

Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24\*7 during evaluation.

I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.

Also, some ques requires external toolings like

1. In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.
2. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?
3. GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.

How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.

Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like

1. In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI.
2. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?

Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API\_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.

Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

---

### Post #32 by **Saransh Saini** on *March 06, 2025*

Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that’s sufficient validation.

If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,  
Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

### Post #34 by **Shalini Saravanan** on *March 06, 2025*
Hello Sir,

I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.

1. Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.
2. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.
3. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence\_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?
4. How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

What does it mean to solve the question?  
Everyone is asking that?  
Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?  
Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

“and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.”  
From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that ![:backhand_index_pointing_down:t3:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/backhand_index_pointing_down/3.png?v=13 ":backhand_index_pointing_down:t3:")  
" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"  
If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant.  
Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.

I understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don’t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?

### Post #37 by **Vicky Kumar** on *March 08, 2025*

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:

* Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
* Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
* Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
* Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
* Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
* Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
* Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
* Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)

## AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor

Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.

To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s`, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

What is the output of `code -s`? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.

As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.

My Approach , is to

1. scrape and parse all the current question
2. create embeddings , of the questions.
3. create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
4. segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
5. Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy  
   to deploy a server and return an url

### Post #49 by **Ayush Kumar Shaw ** on *March 17, 2025*
Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally, to check for the accuracy of solving the question.

1. I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
2. Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)

The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.

1. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
2. Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
3. Give the answer back as specified.

Kind regards

Like instead of `code -s` there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?

The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer

Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.

The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.

I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!

For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.

What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.

The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.

A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.

etc.

### Post #66 by **B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA** on *March 19, 2025*
Hi TAs,

I attended the meet which happened today. But I don’t clearly get one thing.

Most of the questions have a **question text** and a **file: csv,zip,json,etc**

My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"

```

Hi @23f2000573

Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.

You can send a file from local machine like this `-F "file=@abcd.zip"` so here `abcd.zip` must be in current working directory.

Kind regards

---

### Post #68 by **B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA** on *March 20, 2025*
> Replying to @Jivraj

Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.

## FILES

The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requester’s** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png

This link was take from GA2 Question 2

## HTML AND TABLE

Some questions have `html` and `tables`. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.

Example for string. Consider the table

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 |

Will this be something like this

```
"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"

```

or something like

```
"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"

```

## HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS

In one question, there were two tasks.

* Find the answer to the question
* Enable the `disabled` text block

In this question, what will the answer type be?

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

## MORE THAN ONE FILE

Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 

```

## CORS HEADERS

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

---

### Post #69 by **Durga Prasad** on *March 20, 2025*
Hi,  
In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.

```
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')

```

Is this the code for others as well?  
Thanks

### Post #70 by **Pradeep Mondal** on *March 20, 2025*
So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:

→ the set of question-answers pairs at first  
→ All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions  
→ Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.

Till now I have created the following:

→ Identification of the question, using embeddings  
→ extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question  
→ Implementation of 3 questions using this approach

If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.

\*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14 ":slight_smile:")

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/48.png) Jivraj:

> file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click → download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png.

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

Will it be

* “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and
* “file=https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png” for the second type

![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/48.png) Jivraj:

Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute

> In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine.

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it’s a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it’s markdown table then it can be identified with `|` characters.

The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using `\"` inside the answer like this.

![Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.25.02 PM](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/e/1e4550c6e2637e7cf226d943eb61ccb0a8f96770.png)

The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.  
We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with `\"` however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

For questions like this (there’s a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?  
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?  
If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.

Use the following script to enable answer boxes and check answers buttons:

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons  = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

```

For GA-1 question 10,  
we need to get the hash of the json, from the site JSON Hash,  
I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python?

@carlton @Jivraj

Update:

* I was successful in getting the hash in js.

You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo.  
Any github name, repo name is fine.  
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.

### Post #92 by **Manmeet Kaur** on *March 23, 2025*
@carlton and @jivraj,

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..

I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.

I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?

In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren’t any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

I faced the same issue. Initially, I used `geopy.geocoders` to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result.

Instead of using `geopy`, try using this URL directly: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search .  
This worked for me.

1. I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn’t getting the markdown.
2. In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
**Respected TDS Team,**

I currently have Three doubts regarding **Project 2**:

1. As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I’m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1—one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.

   friend data938×465 20.5 KB

     
   During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.
2. In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.

   Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.
3. In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.  
   Here is the thread link for reference.

Hi @23f2003751

### Short Answer: No

### Long Answer:

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn’t taking this into consideration. Check this out.  
This is my response  

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/c/2ce94f6194ed92d7a97deab5905560168e9efc33.png)

image1113×125 3.01 KB

which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes

@Saransh\_Saini

it can’t be fixed actually, you would need the answer in the json format

`{"answer": "actual_answer"}`

but if the actual\_answer needs to be string and if it happens to be of json type, it has to be represented using `\"`

The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.

# Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session)

Respected TDS Team,

As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.

---

## :red_exclamation_mark: Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue

1. GA3 Q8

   * Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.
2. GA3 Q9

   * Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY\_TOKEN.
   * Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?
3. GA4 Q2 & Q10

   * Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
   * Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution
4. Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)

   * Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
   * Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.
5. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions

   * Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a \*\*live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
   * Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?

---

## Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)

Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:

1. Platform Capability for GA Tasks

   * Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
   * Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.
2. File Upload Example via Platform API

   * Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
   * This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.
3. General Observations on GA1-5  
   Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

---

Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.

@carlton ( @Saransh\_Saini ) @Jivraj , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like **need**

Hi @23f1002382 ,  
Unfortunately it’s not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.

All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2 ![:victory_hand:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/victory_hand.png?v=14 ":victory_hand:")

You can use the `zipfile` library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it.

It can be 1-5 random questions from all 58 question. Its not like a random question each from each GA. It’s even possible to get all those 5 questions from one single GA.

just to clarify if the llm is giving the output like this the evaluation script will mark it correct.

```
{
 "answer": "[{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":16},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":23},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":28},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":36},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":44},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":57},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":65},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":68},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":70},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":88},{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":94},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":97}]"

Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.

Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.

The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.

The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)

To check if a string has invisible characters,

```
# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])

```

e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9

This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,

```
import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 

```

See what happens when I print the result

```
print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.

Here is a json example:

```
json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Look at the response. A perfect json.  
![Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 3.30.17 pm](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/df98b9abfbf5f7d32de578c727f25b166a564560.png)

If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

Kind regards

I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.  
5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can’t exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.

5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

Hey guys, I have designed the code, and it currently works for the first 11 GA1 questions and the sixth and third questions of GA2. I have accounted for all edge cases. Please check the code at this link:  
https://4e52-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app/.  
Let me know your thoughts!

### Post #126 by **LAKSHAY** on *March 27, 2025*
@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini

1. **GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**

* As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.
* To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.
* However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.

2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**

* A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.
* Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.

### **Final Thoughts on Project 2**

Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.

1. **Organization & Structure:**  
   The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**  
   There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
3. **Time Constraints:**  
   Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
4. **Sessions & Support:**  
   The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
5. **Deployment Variability:**  
   Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**  
   I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**  
   Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.

---

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**

Dear Sirs,

I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the `.gz` file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the `.gz` file?

Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?

Essentialy, will the API call look like so?

> curl -X POST “http://127.0.0.1:5000”   
> -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data”   
> -F "question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - anand.net is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields:

I would appreciate your clarification on whether the `.gz` file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

@carlton  
I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.  
How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.

@s.anand  
@carlton @Jivraj  
Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.  
It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.

Hi @lakshaygarg654,  
Yes for GA4\_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.  
Unfortunately, we can’t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

Thanks for the answer sir.

I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.

Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"

```

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,

### Post #155 by **Vicky Kumar** on *March 29, 2025*
Hello Sir,

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py`, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.`

However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?

Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes `first.py` for GA1.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!

Best regards,  
vicky kumar

1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my\_response as json formatted string)  

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/2/b2c5345c348f63fcf52240ba6c07cb8655d7d17c.png)

2nd process ( This one is Json object)

or both are incorrect?

This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:

The vercel api question in GA2, does the endpoint that we give you have to be a vercel url or just hosting it in anyway is alright?

I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID (**23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method.

@carlton @Jivraj Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azure’s student benefits?

Hi @lakshaygarg654  
In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object `{"answer" : "YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING"}`. In any case the value of the `"answer"` key should be a string.

This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL.

```
def run(question, file_path):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api"
    questions = {'question': question}
    files = [
        ('file', open("abcd.zip", 'rb')),
        ('file', open("dcba.img", 'rb'))
    ]
    response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files)
    return response

```

or

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \

I couldn’t find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling.

At this moment it can’t be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.

To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?

Edit:  
Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj  
I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice.

GA1:  
Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

GA2:  
Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this

```
{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
}

```

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

GA3:

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.

GA4:

The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

GA5:

No particular questions at the moment.

Please help me out by answering these asap

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.  
`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It’s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.

Check with other student if they have a different email then it is a parameter and can change.

This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline.

Same answer as Q13 GA1

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```  
One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:

```
au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u

```

Write a Python program that uses `httpx` to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:

1. Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.
2. Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the model.
3. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.
4. The second message must be **exactly** the text contained above.

This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.

**Note**: This uses a dummy `httpx` library, not the real one. You can only use:

1. `response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)`
2. `response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)`
3. `response.raise_for_status()`
4. `response.json()`

```

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big.

I guess @Jivraj is right.

We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach.

However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding.

Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support.

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as “17. Kraven: The Hunter” but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as “17. Kraven the Hunter”, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.  
No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do

* Remove unused libraries from your `requirements.txt`. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like `SentenceTransformers` can install large sub-dependency packages.
* Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
* Create a `.containerignore` file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
* Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you’ve mentioned that for Github questions → actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.

For GA2 Q9 → I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.

through this i got this image in my file output directly  
and is your internal server capable of extracted from given location or we have to handle this internally

I am going to clarify this once and for all  
The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

```
{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }

```

This is the way we are expecting your responses.  
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don’t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.  
So,

```
"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"

```

is also valid.

i cannot use github as file goes to 18gb what is solution for it as you are asking for github  
but i created repo there is only main file vicky\_server.py,copy\_tds.py  
can you explain how to solve this problem and i will use ngrok so we have to open that till you check and how i know that you will check my api that time or when  
as vercel don’t supported it

@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton  
Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3

What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under **/telugu/** from **11:00** until before **20:00** on Mondays?

For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else’s solution; both give the same answer - **2698**

However, the portal says it’s incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.

Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.

My script:

```
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count

```

I had extracted and uploaded the `data` after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.

The other script:

```
import pandas as pd
import gzip
import re
import os
from datetime import datetime
import hashlib
from google.colab import files

# Function to compute SHA-256 hash
def compute_hash(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()

# Function to parse Apache log entries
def parse_log_line(line):
    log_pattern = (r'^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[(.*?)\] "(\S+) (.*?) (\S+)" (\d+) (\S+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)" (\S+) (\S+)$')
    match = re.match(log_pattern, line)
    if match:
        return {
            "ip": match.group(1),
            "time": match.group(4),
            "method": match.group(5),

            "vhost": match.group(12),
            "server": match.group(13)
        }
    return None

# Upload file

file_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]  # Get uploaded file name

# Load and parse the log file
def load_logs(file_path):
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
        return pd.DataFrame()

    parsed_logs = []
    with gzip.open(file_path, 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in f:
            parsed_entry = parse_log_line(line)
            if parsed_entry:
                parsed_logs.append(parsed_entry)
    return pd.DataFrame(parsed_logs)

# Convert time format
def convert_time(timestamp):
    return datetime.strptime(timestamp, "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z")

df = load_logs(file_path)

if not df.empty:
    df["datetime"] = df["time"].apply(convert_time)
    df["day_of_week"] = df["datetime"].dt.strftime('%A')
    df["hour"] = df["datetime"].dt.hour

    # Filter conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df["method"] == "GET") &
        (df["url"].str.startswith("/telugu/")) &
        (df["status"] >= 200) & (df["status"] < 300) &
        (df["day_of_week"] == "Monday") &
        (df["hour"] >= 11) &
        (df["hour"] < 20)
    ]

    # Compute hash of the result
    result_hash = compute_hash(str(len(filtered_df)))

    # Output the count and hash
    print("Successful GET requests for /telugu/ on Mondays (11:00-7:59 AM):", len(filtered_df))
else:
    print("No log data available for processing.")

```

Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.

### Post #227 by **Shivaditya Bhattacharya** on *March 31, 2025*
@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.  
For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.

So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.

Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?

Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.

Regards,  
Shivaditya

For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like http://ip:port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint?

Sir, I have created the frontend app like an html page with the fastapi utilizing the chatgpt-o3 , instead of Api key. I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data).

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand, @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh\_Saini please reply me.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.

Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.

It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.

hi,

I dont share your views.

i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.

I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.

all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.

but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.

Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify

for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections

All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,

You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)

The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.

> Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:

Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

> They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?

Yes these were explained if you

1. either took part in any live session or
2. watched the recorded video

> And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?

I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

> It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.

Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:  
Create a server api that receives a request.  
The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.  
The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.

Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.

> Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?

Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.

If you want solutions, there are several options:

1. Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)
2. Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)
3. Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)
4. Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:

> They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.

This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.

The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

> Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.

If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.

But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.

What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.

I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.

Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. **Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.** Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.

Now is a good time to start.

> Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "

That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:

> I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?

They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.

**Luckily for you,** our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).

If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.

> In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?

Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.

But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.

You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.

I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.

But thank you for your feedback.

One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.

And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

Kind regards,

### Post #315 by **B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA** on *April 02, 2025*
> Replying to @23f2002668

Hi, I have a few things to say

## My background :

I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

## My Initial Disappointments with this Course

In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):

> The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.

* Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph
* ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.
* There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.

## Why did I fail?

### Last Term

I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.

## This term.

I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.

In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.

## Me Understanding about the Course Now

This one line changed my view about ROE.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png)On another topic

> **What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.

I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.

Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.

In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.

This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an ***implicit*** way.

This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.

I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks

I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.

I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.

From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.

Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh\_Saini

> Just two suggestions

* I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.
* While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.

Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.  
Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration.

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi – it gives errors like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

```
{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}

```

Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

Nothing more brother.

The success of students’ future, is the best reward.

Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes. But if you’ve learnt something valuable on the journey, then you are better prepared for what comes next regardless of whether you could clear the obstacle the first time or not.

The way we test your api is **not through a front end.**

We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.

We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.

As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.

### Post #333 by **Yashvardhan** on *April 04, 2025*
Dear @Carlton and @S.Anand,  
I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.  
Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

### Post #334 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *April 04, 2025*

We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.

Hope that answers your question.

---

### Post #335 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *April 04, 2025*
> Replying to @23f2004644

The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.  
Also the before deadline one end point is  
/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

# :graduation_cap: From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras

![:rocket:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/rocket.png?v=14 ":rocket:") **Project Demo Website**: https://app.algsoch.tech

During our college course *Tool for Data Science (TDS)* at **IIT Madras**, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: **to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API**.

## :brain: The Mission:

Create a tool that behaves like a **chatbot**, accepts **user queries (text or file-based)** via **web or API**, processes them intelligently, **executes the appropriate code**, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant.

---

## :counterclockwise_arrows_button: The Journey: From Fails to Final

At first, the natural choice was to try **LLM agents**—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. ![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14 ":cross_mark:")

Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files**, or queried in **non-standard formats** like “code -s” or “code -v”.

The next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. ![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14 ":cross_mark:")

---

## :wrench: The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping

After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**

---

## :globe_with_meridians: Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS :fire:

Vicky is a **smart, modular chatbot** built specifically for **Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras**. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.

### Key Features:

![:brain:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14 ":brain:") **Graded Assignment Solver**  
Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:

* `code -s` / `code -v` → VS terminal commands
* Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching
* GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup
* Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression

![:open_file_folder:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/open_file_folder.png?v=14 ":open_file_folder:") **File Upload with Query Matching**  
Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.

![:globe_showing_europe_africa:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/globe_showing_europe_africa.png?v=14 ":globe_showing_europe_africa:") **HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder**

* View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy
* Upload Base64 string → Get original image back

![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/robot.png?v=14 ":robot:") **Webhooks Integration**

* Live notifications via **Discord** & **Slack** whenever `/api` endpoints are accessed
* Monitors **server status (online/offline)** and sends real-time updates

![:spouting_whale:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/spouting_whale.png?v=14 ":spouting_whale:") **LLM Download + Auto Tunneling**

* Downloads LLaMA models
* Dynamically finds available ports
* Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints

![:chart_increasing:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/chart_increasing.png?v=14 ":chart_increasing:") **Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech**

* Ask any TDS question
* Upload and query with files
* Image decoder
* Graded assignment slider navigation
* HTML viewer
* API health status

---

## :man_technologist: Built With:

* **FastAPI** for blazing fast APIs
* **Regex & Pattern Matching** for dynamic input detection
* **GitHub Copilot** + my Python debugging and architectural thinking
* Full webhook and status monitoring system
* Modular backend (`vicky_server.py`) and web frontend (`vicky_app.py`)

I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead.  
Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,  
I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.  
I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.

Hi @carlton

The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh\_Saini.

It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.  
We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.

Thank you

Dear Sir @carlton,

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.

So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?

something’s cooking… ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=14 ":sweat_smile:") And it doesn’t seem like good news for us — at least from the initial visuals.

@carlton I’m noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs—mostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure—targeting sensitive paths like `/t4`, `/logincheck`, `/.env`, and `/.git/config`. These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??

### Post #357 by **Andrew David** on *April 06, 2025*
Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?  
I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?

Maybe a helpful tip for next time

If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.

@carlton sir

A lot of us have hosted on Azure and other platforms and were wondering by when we could expect project 2 marks so that we can take this down ? Could we have rough idea as to when the results will be available ?

### Post #369 by **ABHIJEET KUMAR ** on *April 06, 2025*
@Carlton, I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details:

```
{'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'}

```

This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.

@Saransh\_Saini - This is 24f1001631  
The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.  
I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.  
I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)… but i fixed it.

Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses `curl` to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed.

Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered?

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

Hello,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.

Now that I’m back in Delhi, I’m connected to the internet, and I’m happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook

### Post #422 by **Shivaditya Bhattacharya** on *April 07, 2025*
@Saransh\_Saini  
Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.

1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  
   a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response  
   b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307  
   whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”

The logs from Cloud Run  

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/a/0aec52c2574797f9b3c56589104b77ef4c82bb6d_2_690x387.png)

image982×552 133 KB

As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/6/568addb34b3014bc9b4c0735ff554a6fbc1ca2c4_2_644x500.png)

My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‘Absent’ or will it be updated in a few days?

@Carlton @Saransh\_Saini, it would be helpful if you could specify a date — a clear deadline

### Post #434 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *April 08, 2025*
> Replying to @23f2004912

We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

@carlton Could you clarify if some kind of a normalisation will be done this time as well? Or if some bonus marks will be given? Last time, it didn’t help as much because the highest marks were 16.

This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.

Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).

Hello @Saransh\_Saini , @Jivraj  
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,  
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,  
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,  
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??  
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,  
You can check its working from interface too  
Please check once !!

## Humble Request to Update API Request Link

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request.

**Previous API Request Link:**

![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/a/aae809b0bbff330e7cec1d2f6ae9eb8551d928c2.png)
project2llm-production.up.railway.app

### IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI

**Correct API Request Link:**  
https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/  
https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/

Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Pratyush Pulak Nishhank

But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x  
Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%  
We have learned so many things and try to implement in it too,…

Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade … and our CGPA doesn’t decrease much  
because projects hold the major chunk in grading

sir my roll number is 23f2004462

Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel  
https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app  
and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.  
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

Dear Sir,  
In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/ as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?

Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I’ve submitted the project but it’s showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.

### Post #493 by **Sahil Raj ** on *April 14, 2025*
@carlton @Saransh\_Saini sir ,  
I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.

If possible, I kindly request either of the following:

1. Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or
2. Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time.

Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

Thank you for your support and guidance.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that’s why I made that post(the one to which I’m replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score.

Hi sir @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** FastAPI - Swagger UI
* **API Endpoint:** http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

Sir, I too had provided render API and my logs do not show that it was accessed during the evaluation period. I had submitted the link in the form which was provided to update the link as i had not received any mail that my project had been evaluated before that.  
Due to this, my score stands 0 as of now.  
Sir, can you please look into this. Thank you

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (http://35.192.157.22.80) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding /api/ and it was http://35.192.157.22/api/. My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.

My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc

Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again

I received 20 in project 2 which I think is not correct. I also tested my api with questions with different parameters to make sure it is giving correct responses. You are requested to kindly recheck and share the evaluation logs.

Hi sir @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **Server is running and reachable.**  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** – all received correct results.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **No issues seen in logs or deployment** – everything was set up properly.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **Others in my group got full marks** – we worked on the same project.

![:red_exclamation_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14 ":red_exclamation_mark:") **I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**  
![:red_exclamation_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14 ":red_exclamation_mark:") **I’ve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.  
![:red_exclamation_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14 ":red_exclamation_mark:") **This is my last term** – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** FastAPI - Swagger UI
* **API Endpoint:** http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

as you can see my vm is working fine here  

![vm start](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/4/c4651dbc319b2d00ad1f0ea85e10c4c716b3ae25_2_690x387.png)

I would also like to emphasize that:

No edits were made to the form after submission.  
I did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.  
My Vercel API is still active and functioning as expected.

I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I’d be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the valid, timely submission and the active working links provided.

This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant setback, potentially requiring me to repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine — a small yet critical one — and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

### TDS Solver

but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:

https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/

Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL

Sir i also did the same mistake and am truly sorry for what i did but it is my dearest request if you can look into this matter as it is very essential that the project is evaluated.

Dear Sirs,

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.

I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.

For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.

I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.

I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton  
Respected Sir,  
Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:  
currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/`

but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/`

I’m sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL

Thank you

actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir

Thank you

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation.

I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest.

\***Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint**

Dear @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini @carlton

I hope you’re doing well!

I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at:

```
https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/

```

However, I’m encountering the following error:

```
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app

```

After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using **public DNS services** like **Google (8.8.8.8)** or **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).

---

### :hammer_and_wrench: Suggested Fix:

To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a **public DNS** provider?

Recommended options:

* **Google DNS**: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`
* **Cloudflare DNS**: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`

This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.

---

### :repeat_button: Alternate Option:

If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the **previously deployed endpoint** instead:

```
https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/

```

Please note that this endpoint may take **50 to 60 seconds** to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.

Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.

---

Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

Best regards,  
**Sahil Raj**

Dear @Jivraj @carlton

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/  
whereas the correct api for giving post requests has **/api** added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e\*\*.https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/\*\*  
I have checked again and the post requests are working.  
I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with the above endpoint

Hi Jivraj,

I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.

At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.

Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.

Thank you!

We didn’t account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.

Anyone who didn’t use their IITM email during submission—even if they later filled out the form—was filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

Yes, the new page took about 5–10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.  
If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.  
In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.

However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.

I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.

I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.  
I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.

To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.

@carlton @Jivraj I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the “/api” path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.

To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated — using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields — I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

I am unsure of the exact question, but it seems that the question can be modified with search terms and points. For example, in the account, it was stated as [‘text editor’, at least 77 points’]. If this were the parameter, then my answer would be correct, and I have proof.

Case 3: JSON Key Count – XF Parameter (GA5\_q7)

{

“api”: “https://app.algsoch.tech/api/”,

“test\_code”: “GA5\_q7”,

“status”: “ERROR”,

“error”: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’”

}

#### :memo: What Was Expected:

The question required developing a script that:

* Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and
* Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure.

It was explicitly stated that:

* Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.
* The file to be used was:  
  E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json

#### :white_check_mark: What I Did:

I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.

Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command:

curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \

-H “accept: application/json” \

-F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \

-F “file=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json”

API Output:{“answer”:“14602”}

This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.

#### :warning: What Went Wrong on API Side:

The API returned a parsing error, indicating:

“invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’”

However:

* My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.
* The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.
* It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.

#### :light_bulb: Insight:

If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.

However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

Good Afternoon Sir.  
This is regarding project 1 and project 2.

**Project-1 Evaluation**  
Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.  
Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

**Project-2 Evaluation**  
Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.

Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.

In anticipation of quick response  
Thank You

Hi everyone,

I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.

Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.

Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Kind regards,

What’s the error in the log? It’s GA2 Question 3. I can see u haven’t wrapped your email address inside `<!--email_off-->` tag.

I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the “http” or “https” prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.

This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‘E’, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.

In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

**Subject:** Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m **Vicky Kumar**, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at **IIT Madras**. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called **“Vicky App”** — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like **TDS,**.

The system is capable of:

* Accurately solving over **90% of assignment-style questions** using regex and phonetic matching
* Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input
* Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON
* Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM

You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech

---

### :light_bulb: What’s in it for students:

* They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
* Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
* I’ve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
* After that, students can access the full platform for just **₹199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs

---

### :folded_hands: My Humble Request:

This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.

To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.

I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

It’s built *by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students* — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.

Thank you so much for your time and support.

Warm regards,  
**Vicky Kumar**

It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.

Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.
