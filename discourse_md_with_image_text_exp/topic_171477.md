Apologies for that,

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

Kind regards

Hi @carlton,

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?

My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project\_1\_tds

Thanking You

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science

> Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation.
> Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
