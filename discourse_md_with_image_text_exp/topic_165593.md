# Live sessions regarding Project 1

### Post #1 by **Sakthivel S** on *January 28, 2025*
In the discussion Thread for Project 1, it was said that there will be live sessions conducted for the project, however, there hasn’t been one specifically for it.

If there are live sessions that will be conducted, can we have some hands on tutorial for the project ?

Hi Sakthivel,

We are still covering the precursors for Project. Once we cover the required topics then we will have sessions that work through the project with the students.

Kind regards
