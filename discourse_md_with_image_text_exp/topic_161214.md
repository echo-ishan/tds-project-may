# Contribute to My Open-Source LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator

### Post #1 by **Avinash Shrivastava ** on *January 06, 2025*
Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the \*Tools in Data Science \* course: **LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**. This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **@s.anand**, our course instructor, and TAs **@Carlton** and **@Jivraj**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

* Expand functionality and evaluation models.
* Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
* Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Best regards,

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.
