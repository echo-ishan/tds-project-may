how to get the dummy API key?

### Post #4 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** on *January 15, 2025*
> Replying to @nilaychugh

Hi Nilay,

In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)

kind regards

Hi @22f3001315 ,

You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.

Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body Vision - OpenAI API.

Kind regards

No, if you scroll down to the last question, we can get our Ai Proxy key

### Post #14 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *January 21, 2025*
> Replying to @nilaychugh

@nilaychugh @22f3002034

The API key is available at https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/

The instructions on how to use the token is given at GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

but the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI

---

### Post #16 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** on *January 22, 2025*

Hi Nilay,

Yes you would need to use `text-embedding-3-small` model of openai for embedding questions.

Kind regards

### Post #17 by **Nilay Chugh** on *January 23, 2025*

i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, **is there any solution to this problem?**

Hi Vikash,

I looked at your answers in backend. In answer you submitted response from openai, but you need to submit json object which is required for sending a request to LLM.

Kind regards

---

### Post #22 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** on *January 23, 2025*
> Replying to @21f3002277

You made same mistake here, instead of response use json body that’s required for sending request to LLM.

Kind regards

I tried downloading image for your dataset it is 2.36 KB in size.  
Using base64 encoded string from `image_url.url` in your code when decoded comes out to be 8.18 KB, when I encoded image from your dataset and decoded it was 2.36 KB.

Hi VIKASH,

This problem must be because CORS not enabled or you are running your application inside wsl, if you using WSL then you would need to identify ipaddress of WSL and use it in place of `127.0.0.1`

In the 6th question ,as I open the graded assignment all the time the new question is generated (NUMERICAL DATA) and the previous answer shows as incorrect answer

### Post #48 by **Shalini Saravanan** on *January 31, 2025*
Hello Sir,

I am unable to recieve a proper output for q1 of ga3.  
This is my test message. Its been given in two lines.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/0/60deb1fe7cda3d6876df481d07803e66d1974e45.png)

The below is my code for the question.

```
import httpx

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

system_message = "Analyze the input message if it's  GOOD , BAD or NEUTRAL."
user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4  AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"

payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},  # System message
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}       # One user message
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7
}

response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

for choice in result["choices"]:
    print("AI Response:", choice["message"]["content"])

```

I tried to put the two test lines as two user messages but received an error stating that the json body must contain only 2 messages with one mandatorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/4/740853eca092fd94814c5c4cb8cc4ddb5f10eba3.png)

Kindly advice on how to proceed.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

### Post #49 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *January 31, 2025*
Hi Shalini,

Your `user_message` is incorrect. I looked at your exact GA and it works if you make sure your `user_message` is precisely what is given to you.

Hint: How do you store a multi-line variable in python?

For those who want to experiment with GPT-4o Mini (or other models), Github Models is free. You can explore and compare models, including GPT-4o Mini, DeepSeek R1, and others.

It has rate limits, so you can’t use it in production, but is a good place to prototype applications and experiment with prompts.

Use addition : to add up your score for each question.  
eq:  
1+ 1 = 2  
Fractions are harder  
1.5 + 1 = 2.5

Try sending an api call to openai.

### Post #96 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** on *February 05, 2025*
> Replying to @Sudhishnarayan

Check with network tab, you would see the response of api call being made, Compare that with expected output.

Regrading question 8, you would need to check if cors are enabled, check in browser console tab for more.

For question 2, do we have to make the API call to the proxy or openai? If to the proxy, are there any instructions on the page *before* question 2 that would have pointed me in that direction?

I tried checking the JSON Output in the Networks tab. I am getting error as “Method Not Found”. But, I have allowed POST Method for question 7 as POST method is used in the question. I also tried checking my API by sending a POST request by the same parameters as given by the Website. I am getting the proper response when I give an API request. Can you please help me out here? I have attached the screenshot of the error as Picture -1 and the correct output what I get as Picture-2. Please help me out as I am facing issue for all the API Questions though I am getting the right output. Thank You.

Hi,

I’m sorry if I’m asking an unrelated question, But I’m very confused with the concept of generating the token from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Could any one suggest the step by step process? I couldn’t able to find that similar question asked by anyone since the conversations are vast.

Please guide me on this. Also do i need to use my personal mail id or iitm mail id for accessing this token

yes you have to use your IITM email id . Use this link and login you will get your token:

The error shows your code is getting wrong answers for the test cases. I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings with required headers. And, then calculate `similarity_scores` simply using  
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}  
which in python syntax is-

```
np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

```

### Post #122 by **Sudhish Narayan S** on *February 05, 2025*
Sir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You

This is my code for the 7th question of finding similarities. This code, I tried on my own, but it is showing Incorrect Matches. I think so it is due to the Aliababa GTE Model. Please correct me if I have gone wrong anywhere. Thank You

There are few more tokens for the user prompt, I think if you add 7 or 8 then you would get correct answer.

Other way to do this question is send a request to anand sir’s aiproxy and in response you will get number of input tokens.

I inspected the JavaScript code of this website, I saw that the answer took my input and added 7 to it, why is it programmed this way? Even if I were to use the AI proxy that was given shouldn’t the number of tokens remain unaffected?

> Replying to @23f2000237

When you send request to openai through anand sir’s proxy it takes some tokens for user prompt.

When you use tokenizer from openai’s webpage then it doesn’t take care of that.

For question 7

> ```

You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request

```
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}'
}

json_data = {
    'model':'gpt-4o-mini',
    'messages':[
        {
            'role':'user',
            'content':'What is 2+2?'
        }
    ]
}
r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0)

```

You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made.  
Url’s for free api keys:

1. AI Proxy
2. OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models

The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs.

---

For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order`.

Kind regards

Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/6/b6feb2e4fd01c3630f5db6ee879eb4042b7cec09.png)

image1288×138 7.33 KB

I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

### Post #138 by **SHAON BALLAV** on *February 03, 2025*
Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.

![Screenshot_20250204_032923](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/4/14b928ed4ee1d76113b90069812abf2b53ab4ef1_2_690x428.png)

Screenshot\_20250204\_032923991×615 43.7 KB

I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

```
class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
    query: str       # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)


.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])

```

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that ![:grinning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning.png?v=12 ":grinning:")

{
  "matches": ["Contents of document 3", "Contents of document 1", "Contents of document 2"]

```

Check if your response is in this format.

Does the final submission get graded, or is the highest-scoring submission considered?

I’m facing an issue where my score dropped from 8 to 6.5 when I checked all the answers one last time before submitting. I suspect the drop is due to the 3rd and 7th questions.

![Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/0/b00269ee7b24a8f28c8ab53f4da556a11c8f3d27.png)

The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum… just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.

**Realizing the Value of Collaboration**

As I’ve been going through this course, one thing that’s really started to make sense to me is how important collaboration is. None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.

I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.

This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.

For Question 3, I was able to enable the answer box but the answer is always saying that either it is not valid json format or Error: Model must be gpt-4o-mini, not undefined.

I have tried multiple approaches but the same issue even after using help from Chat GPT. Could any one tell what is the correct answer?? Thanks!

One issue is there in

```
"response_format": "json"  // incorrect 

```

Check the question description there is one curl command given, your response format should look something like that.
