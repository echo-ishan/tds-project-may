# Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies

### Post #1 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** on *March 28, 2025*
Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

@carlton

## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?

All the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

## How to fix bugs in our scripts

Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .

### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**

If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:  
Submit Report

## Bug fixes

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

@carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.

We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.

This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

@carlton same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

* **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We *may* pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7**, **B8**, and **B10**, the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

@Jivraj , @carlton  
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as ‚Äúcan‚Äôt read the file.‚Äù

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86\_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

@23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

You have to identify the exact bug for your claim to be considered. Thats why we have provided you with the scripts and the logs. You might get lots of marks. Its in your interest to identify the bug.

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

Kind regards

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

```
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

```

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY\_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

Yes, I agree.  
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?  
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don‚Äôt know where I have went wrong.

Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.  
*" I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information `harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final latest d0f14a872042 5 weeks ago 214MB` "*

Also sir, could you please tell me why the error as shown in my previous message is being shown? and if there is no chance of it getting correct.

Hi @carlton !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

The error occurs because Python cannot find the `tasksA` module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.

Yeah, it‚Äôs there on your local machine, but you didn‚Äôt copy it to docker container.  
Below is content of your docker file which doesn‚Äôt copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY app.py /app

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn‚Äôt follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

### Post #72 by **Khushi Shah** on *March 29, 2025*
@Jivraj @carlton

I‚Äôm writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it‚Äôs just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2¬Ω weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.
2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn‚Äôt receive a reply.
3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.
4. I also didn‚Äôt receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.

I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn‚Äôt process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

That‚Äôs external port mapping, we mapped your docker‚Äôs port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won‚Äôt create issues.

Just look at docker\_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), ‚Äúpath\_given‚Äù). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

Hello,

My log file shows a ‚Äúfile not found‚Äù or ‚Äúdirectory not found‚Äù error. Could you confirm whether `datagen.py` was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS?

My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/dfc4c289dcc2ddda315bd9f97a9ff21c166792af.png)

image1485√ó807 37.4 KB

The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?  

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/8/681a3a02c951eaf7014d116d45b9ac35b8fdd2de.png)

image302√ó252 3.45 KB

  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday‚Äôs results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren‚Äôt even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don‚Äôt understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Kind regards

### Post #126 by **Santosh Sharma** on *March 30, 2025*
Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I‚Äôve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

### Post #130 by **RAJ K BOOPATHI** on *March 30, 2025*
Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. ‚ÄúData outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.‚Äù - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK

```
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


```

Similarly for task B2.

```
INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‚Äòmain‚Äô branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?  
Because I see only ‚Äú=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting‚Äù for Task B8

### Post #131 by **Jayaram** on *March 30, 2025*
@Jivraj @carlton  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build

```
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

```

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies ¬∑ rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 ¬∑ GitHub

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation‚Ä¶ Appreciate your help

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn‚Äôt have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for ‚ÄúDockerfile‚Äù with an uppercase ‚ÄúD‚Äù. If that‚Äôs the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

> Replying to @AbhinavOhri

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Kind regards

The task B6 was  
https://quotes.toscrape.com/ has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author‚Äôs name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

Can you also clarify my issue?

My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log.

@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

***However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.***

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png)

image1272√ó395 25.7 KB

But here‚Äôs the catch:\*\* Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:\*

* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models.
* Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
* Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
* Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent‚Äôs conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
* **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP**, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI‚Äôs API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent‚Äîit essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I‚Äôm not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents**, and it would do that for you‚Äîwithout **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as a **terminal version of** OpenAI‚Äôs Computer-Using Agent.

---

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it‚Äôs incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

## To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29**, **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0**‚Äîsince it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj

Hi @thinkmachine @22f3002723

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens‚Äôt support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Hi @thinkmachine  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won‚Äôt be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won‚Äôt help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn‚Äôt support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up @Jivraj.

@Saransh\_Saini Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would‚Äôve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.

Once again, thank you both!

Hi @lakshaygarg654

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn‚Äôt seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.

### Post #237 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *April 03, 2025*
> Replying to @gouthamnischay

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

### Post #238 by **Saini Nirmal** on *March 31, 2025*
@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool‚Äôs joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That‚Äôs why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

@thinkmachine

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14 ":slight_smile:")

*However* with regards to your long post‚Ä¶

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a *very* experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
2. Wastes valuable time and resources
3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
4. Complicates testing
5. Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

> Replying to @carlton

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It‚Äôs a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would‚Äôve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating ‚Äî I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory ‚Äî to explore the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) *tedious* assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. ![:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=14 ":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

*(‚Ä¶caution: long post ahead ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=14 ":sweat_smile:"))*

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would‚Äôve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike ‚Äî even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There‚Äôs also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior ‚Äî and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn‚Äôt be helpful here as 4o-mini isn‚Äôt all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There‚Äôs only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúagents‚Äù in my view‚Äî they‚Äôre more like passive AI powered regex matchers**: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‚Äòfix‚Äô them and keep calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it‚Äôs all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between ‚Äî The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

* Reason about the task, understand intent,
* Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
* Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
* Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn‚Äôt need dozens of narrow tools ‚Äî just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools**:

* A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
* A Python script runner
* A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally ‚Äî avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) ‚Äî that was **emergent behavior**, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I‚Äôve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I‚Äôll be experimenting with‚Äî modalities.

PS: I‚Äôm not claiming it‚Äôs perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I‚Äôm less concerned about the marks, I‚Äôm actually enjoying the thought joyride. ![:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=14 ":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

---

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn‚Äôt rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates ‚Äî much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I‚Äôve only just wired the pieces together.

Kind regards

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given ‚Äì Repository Was Public with All Required Files

Dear @Carlton sir  
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I‚Äôm a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

* My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
* I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
* I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
* For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I‚Äôm eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .

Hi sir  
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I‚Äôm a bit confused about the change.  
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir  
Thank you

Dear @carlton Sir,

I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.

Respected sir,  
I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn‚Äôt evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.

Dear @carlton Sir,  
I‚Äôve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I‚Äôve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.  
Thank you.

Respected Sir,

I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. I‚Äôm writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I‚Äôve encountered a discrepancy that I‚Äôd like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn‚Äôt find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I‚Äôd really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

@carlton i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term  
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did  
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now.

To replicate the test environment:

Fetch the github repo‚Äôs latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

```
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser (description="Fetch the latest commit before a given deadline.")
parser.add_argument (
    "--owner",
    type=str,
    required=True,
    help="GitHub username."
)
parser.add_argument (
    "--repo",
    type=str,
    required=True,
    help="GitHub repository name."
)
parser.add_argument (
    "--save",

    help="Path to save the zip file. Default='../github/'"
)
parser.add_argument (
    "--extract",
    type=str,
    default="../github/",
    help="Path to extract the zip file. Default='../github/'"
)

args = parser.parse_args ()
owner = args.owner
repo = args.repo
save_path = args.save
extract_path = args.extract

deadline = dt.datetime (2025, 2, 18, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("Asia/Kolkata"))
deadline_str = deadline.isoformat ()

github_headers = {
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
    "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
    "User-Agent": "fetch_git_before",
}

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?until={deadline_str}&per_page=1&page=1"

try:
    response = requests.get (url, headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    response.raise_for_status ()  # Raise an error for bad responses

    # Get the sha
    commits = response.json ()
    if commits:
        latest_sha = commits[0]["sha"]
        print (f"Latest commit before {deadline_str}: {latest_sha}")

        # Get the zip of the commit
        zip_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/zipball/{latest_sha}"
        zip_response = requests.get (zip_url, headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
        zip_response.raise_for_status ()
        zip_filename = f"{latest_sha}.zip"

        # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs (save_path, exist_ok=True)

        with open (save_path + zip_filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write (zip_response.content)
        print (f"Downloaded zip file: {zip_filename}")

        # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs (extract_path, exist_ok=True)

        # Extract the zip file
        with zipfile.ZipFile (extract_path + zip_filename, "r") as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall (extract_path)
        print (f"Extracted zip file to: {extract_path}")

    else:
        print (f"No commits found before {deadline_str}")

except:
    print(f"Error fetching commits: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

```

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

These instructions are same for everyone. So check first before posting here.

Then post with your queries after testing as mentioned above.  
Also check the evaluation logs first to see why it failed. Address that question.  
Posting ‚Äúit ran before submission‚Äù is insufficient evidence.  
The whole point of deployability is that it runs anywhere at anytime.  
That is what is being tested, not that it ran on your machine (unless you replicate the test environment exactly).

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like ‚Äúdocker file has to be only in the root folder.‚Äù

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù didn‚Äôt show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [‚Äú/root/.local/bin/uv‚Äù, ‚Äúrun‚Äù, ‚Äúapp.py‚Äù] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it‚Äôs very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don‚Äôt want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA‚Äôs and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.

### Post #350 by **Santosh Sharma** on *April 06, 2025*
> Replying to @carlton

Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:

```
bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I‚Äôve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

You can take it up with @s.anand  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn‚Äôt exists

Thats why there are no logs.

Sir actually my project doesn‚Äôt have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

```

here u can see it installs using pip install ‚Ä¶

here it‚Äôs requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for AIPROXY\_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git doesn‚Äôt allow upload of `.env` file I couldn‚Äôt upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY\_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because`.env` file doesn‚Äôt upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn‚Äôt have the `.env` file so it didn‚Äôt build so I had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports both`.env` file and environment variable one)

I don‚Äôt know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

@carlton @jivraj sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I‚Äôm proud of the commitment I‚Äôve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there‚Äôs any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

### Post #401 by **Veer Shah** on *April 07, 2025*
> Replying to @carlton

@carlton @jivraj @s.anand,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I‚Äôm a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn‚Äôt going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîit has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I‚Äôve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I‚Äôm grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties‚Äîespecially for a single oversight‚Äîcan significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

@jivraj

earlier I built the project inside app folder so it was

```
COPY app /app

```

it should have been

```
COPY . /app

```

Is there anything that can be done on your end now?  
All the code is there.

For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has to be Dockerfile.

### Post #421 by **K Senthur Kumaran ** on *April 07, 2025*
Dear @carlton

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:

```
python run.py

```

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.  
Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container‚Äîit‚Äôs not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

### Post #427 by **Mishkat Chougule** on *April 07, 2025*
> Replying to @Jivraj

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn‚Äôt explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.

### Post #431 by **Wasim Ansari** on *April 07, 2025*
Dear Sirs,  
@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini @carlton

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.

![Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b8a704d618edd74036a95649a83054e29932879.png)

Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805√ó197 9.52 KB

**Github repo submitted:** GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py.  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I‚Äôm unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

@carlton @Jivraj  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png)

image1298√ó857 29.4 KB

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn‚Äôt even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/‚Ä¶  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png)

image1027√ó510 11 KB

  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.

Shivaditya

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

* Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
* when we download the repository it doesn‚Äôt have the `.env` file,
* for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
* after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
* As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`‚Ä¶you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
* after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
* just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

```

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment

```
docker build -t llm-agent .

```

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

```

and in another terminal

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Thank you  
Kind regards

Respected sir  
I understand it‚Äôs my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..

Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of my office environment,

Thanks @carlton @Jivraj  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url‚Äôs set as http\_proxy and https\_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground‚Äô utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1  
@carlton @Jivraj  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS**, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is *linux/amd64* (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo‚Äôs latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.
> # /// script
> # dependencies = [
> # "requests",
> # ]
> # ///
> import requests
> import datetime as dt
> import zoneinfo
> import argparse
> import os
> import zipfile
> parser = argparse.‚Ä¶

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can‚Äôt find the uv executable ‚Äî it‚Äôs not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‚Äòd‚Äô) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‚ÄòD‚Äô).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.

Thanks & Kind regards

Hi Sir,  
I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing **Project1**, but I accidentally named the **Dockerfile** as `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‚Äòd‚Äô).  
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I‚Äôd really appreciate it.  
Thank you!

> Sir,
> Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.
> Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested.
