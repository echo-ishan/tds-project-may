# Queries regarding End Term exam solutions

### Post #1 by **Shambhavi ** on *April 15, 2025*
Hi @carlton and @Jivraj sir,

I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.

I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:

![1000042547](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/d/fd08e14665989ccea8f5a547b569521575208ae8_2_690x369.jpeg)

Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”

To filter such logs, we need:

Time → for the hour and the day (Monday)  
Method → to filter POST  
URL → to filter /images/

So, the correct minimal set is:

> ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Time, Method, URL

Time → needed ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:")  
Method → needed ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:")  
URL → needed ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:")  
Referer → not needed, but not harmful

So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.

Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:

Status is numeric (200)  
Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct

All required fields are present and properly formatted

The other options were as follows:

9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)

9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)

9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827

10000425451079×468 35.7 KB

  
Correct Answer(s):

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).

---

Incorrect Answer:

![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14 ":cross_mark:") POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.

(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)

Thank you

Agree & second all thoughts shared by @24f2003130 above.

* I also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered\_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case `len(filtered entries)` seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .

* The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.
* Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.

Request you to please clarify and consider these points.

Yes @carlton the wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list `filtered_entries`.

# Clarifications on Queries

1. **Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?**  
   Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response.
2. **HTTP method is idempotent**  
   This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.
3. **Entries with 404 status code**  
   Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
4. **Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”?**  
   Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because:

* Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL
* Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page
* Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement

### Post #5 by **Shambhavi ** on *April 16, 2025*

Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:

1. Redundancy in Option A:  
   The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.
2. Simplicity in Filtering:  
   Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:

Time → for checking the hour and weekday.

Method → to filter only POST.

URL → to ensure the request is under /images/.

Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.

3. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices:  
   In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.

Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post.

That’s a great find. They’re the same question with just different parameters. Please look into it @iamprasna sir.

Hi,  
From where are you checking the transcripts? I’m not able to see the answer transcripts in the score checker app.

It seems that the option to download the answer key has been removed. However, you could consider reaching out to someone in the group or checking the dashboard for solution pdf of question paper. You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly.

@iamprasna @carlton Please look into it once. According to point 3 of @iamprasna’s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97. I brought this into attention before the scores were pushed to the dashboard.

The correction has been done to the following question for both the FN and AN sessions. You must be able to see the change in scores shortly

1. **Entries with 404 status code**  
   Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
