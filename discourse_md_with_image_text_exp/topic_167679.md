# Inconsistent information in the Grading Document and the website

### Post #1 by **Aniruddha Mukherjee** on *February 19, 2025*
The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website (s-anand.net) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?  
Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the students…
