# Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]

### Post #1 by **Anand S** on *January 19, 2025*
Please post any questions related to Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent.

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip ¬∑ sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public ¬∑ GitHub

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don‚Äôt rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
   * Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
   * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

sir @Jivraj after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

Hi Guddu ,

I didn‚Äôt make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Kind regards

Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won‚Äôt be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir‚Äôs proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.

### Post #13 by **Aishik Bandyopadhyay** on *January 25, 2025*
While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase ‚Äúrecent log file‚Äù, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

For more information watch this video https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M\_zw8WzpmMCyVQat or watch TDS Live Sessions.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  

![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4_2_500x500.png)

Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764√ó1764 374 KB

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

Hi @23f2005325 ,

Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.

### Post #26 by **Andrew David** on *January 28, 2025*
Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

> Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen

In Tuesday‚Äôs(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
2. Pull an existing docker image.
3. Run that image inside a container.
4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
5. Once done you can commit it.
6. And push customized container‚Äôs image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it‚Äôs a good idea, we will see if it‚Äôs possible to discuss in session.

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Hi @JoelJeffrey ,

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

### Post #39 by **Joel Jeffrey** on *January 31, 2025*

Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic ‚Äúls‚Äù command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y‚Äôall run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn‚Äôt know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying

Hello everyone, @s.anand @carlton  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that‚Äôs already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like ‚Äúpath=/data/format.md‚Äù or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like ‚Äúpath=show the data in format.md‚Äù?
3. Are we concerned about what‚Äôs shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they‚Äôre flexible? Ex. ‚ÄúCount the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt‚Äù

@21f3002390 - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won‚Äôt happen in the future anyway.

**What‚Äôs happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. I fixed that by removing this. I‚Äôll introduce caching later if required.

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

@carlton Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?

Some questions about ‚ÄòB‚Äô group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
B7. Compress or resize an image  
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file  
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML  
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to match every single detail in that even " and ‚Äô .  
in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.  
llm will only handle -calling function based on query and parameter . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.

If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir @carlton @s.anand

```
üî¥ /data/contacts-sorted.json

My output was in good looking structured form but I had to make it look like this just to pass the evaluation.

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn‚Äôt a single full-fledged project session. It‚Äôs a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion.

We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks @23f1002382 @23f2000237) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards

Hi Aindree,

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was *updated* on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as ‚Äúcount\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt‚Äù I am unable to get a response.

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Kind regards

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.

![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/b/1b74cf0c060e28cd3459173bce28d123a8d5da05_2_690x423.png)

Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078√ó1276 305 KB

In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards

*For task A2*:

* **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place

I am getting the following error:  
`üî¥ A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath', '/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`

However, running a **POST request** to https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2 gives successful output.

`{"success":true,"message":"Formatted and verified successfully!"}%`

Here is my code snippet:

```
def format_file(filepath):
    while True:  # Loop until formatting and verification pass
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", filepath],
                check=False,  # Don't raise exception automatically
                capture_output=True,
                text=True
            )

            if result.returncode != 0:
                return {"success": False, "message": f"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}"}

            if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
                return {"success": True, "message": "Formatted and verified successfully!"}
            else:
                logging.info("Verification failed. Retrying formatting...") #Log the retry
                # If verification fails, the loop continues and prettier --write is executed again.

        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "message": str(e)}

def verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
    try:
        subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--check", filepath], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True) #Capture output
        return True  # File is formatted correctly
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Prettier check failed: {e.stderr}") # Log the error from prettier check
        return False  # File is not formatted correctly

```

What am I missing here?

Has anyone succeeded in the extraction of credit cards details task? The LLM seems to consider it as illegal task and if I use pytessaract the docker image size will become really large. What to do in this case?

Hi @carlton @Jivraj,

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>
    os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

```

If i can‚Äôt automate this process, i don‚Äôt see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

```

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this @carlton

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - \* **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors (@carlton, @iamprasna):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.

@23f2001978

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

Kind regards

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don‚Äôt know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!

Just python and uv

More like 128mb image.

Please watch Tues week 5 session 1

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space‚Ä¶will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation‚Ä¶

Hi instructors and TAs,  
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don‚Äôt have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

* Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query‚Äôs response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,

@carlton @Jivraj

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Earlier when I asked this:

Hi @Rishabh2

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that‚Äôs an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

Hi @23f1002382  
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

1. `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine

gives the error:

Hello Sir @carlton @Jivraj  
What are implications on missing the project 1.  
Due to some personal reasons I wasn‚Äôt able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.  
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you

Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 ‚Äî

* **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website
* **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it

Hi,  
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj ,  
In task A6  
**Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).**

Here expected output JSON ‚Äúkey‚Äù is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when ‚Äúpath/to/large-language-models.md‚Äù is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is ‚Äúpath/to/large-language-models.md‚Äù.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.  
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file should be folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file as key.

For as task description like this

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the ‚Äú#‚Äù symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.  
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

@carlton @Jivraj  
sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have  
‚Äô

```
''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''

```

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first‚Ä¶

Or it should be the part of the automation only‚Ä¶

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‚Äò#‚Äô and change it to ‚Äònumber‚Äô and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‚Äòcount the # of‚Äô in a task, please interpret it as ‚Äòcount the number of‚Äô. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

Kind regards

Hey @carlton @Jivraj , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,  
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data` in root directory, will it be fine ?  
or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?  
Thanks

---

### Post #355 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *February 15, 2025*
> Replying to @22f3002248

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.  
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)  
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.  
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.  
create a venv using python3 -m venv name\_of\_venv  
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location  
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.  
It even happened for me

This is where I have been facing the issue.

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

1. in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
2. When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

Blunder in your `main.py`.  
You are using API\_KEY = os.getenv(‚ÄúAI\_PROXY\_TOKEN‚Äù) but it should be AIPROXY\_TOKEN.

What we expect in project.

1. server running inside docker container at 8000.
2. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

No don‚Äôt do that, just follow the procedure.  
Two problems with keeping token in file.

1. It will become public after you push to github.
2. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

the error that comes is :

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn‚Äôt work.  
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.

### Post #490 by **Rohit Garg** on *February 15, 2025*
@carlton needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can‚Äôt understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.  
When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.

```
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo docker run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

I‚Äôm running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

```
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

```

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn‚Äôt include the `"data"` key.

### What I‚Äôve Tried

1. **Token Verification:**

* I‚Äôm using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email.
* The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

```
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"

```

* I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

2. **API Request Details:**

* The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* The payload is set as:

json

Copy

```
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}

```

* Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

3. **Debug Output:**  
   Here‚Äôs a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

```
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
üî¥ A9 failed: 'data'

```

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.

### What I Suspect

* The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
* There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I‚Äôm not aware of.
* Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

### Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database‚Ä¶  
Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases‚Ä¶

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here. But this gave me the following error:

```
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

```

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I‚Äôm not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

Dear @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , and @Saransh\_Saini

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

@carlton Sir, yesterday‚Äôs session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone‚Äôs guidance and support.

1. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.
2. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

@s.anand @carlton  
Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain

True. Same here. Just giving 2 days for this project was definitely a big mistake on my part‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt really give more time due to work commitments.

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj

Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.

I am not 100% sure but i guess i used ‚Äúii‚Äù instead of ‚Äúi‚Äù in ‚Äúthevixhal/tdsvishal‚Äù‚Ä¶ is there any way to check this ?

### Post #619 by **GIRISH VISHVESHVAR BHAT** on *February 17, 2025*
I don‚Äôt think the project is too difficult to implement‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren‚Äôt very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

@s.anand  
@carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task\_handler.py file of my repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.

I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.

@TheVishal  
EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.  
what to do

* push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images  
    
  how will this help?
* since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all  
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

CHEERS

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.

The project was a rollercoaster ride‚Äîespecially with all the errors that kept popping up‚Äîbut overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to @Carlton, @Saransh\_Saini, and @Jivraj sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week‚Äôs lectures, the project couldn‚Äôt have been completed.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like @23f1002382 and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - @s.anand sir, @carlton , @Jivraj for their support throughout this amazing experience.

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‚Äòjson‚Äô

if you look at the ‚Äútype‚Äù key in your response\_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be ‚Äújson‚Äù

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‚Äòjson\_object‚Äô, ‚Äòjson\_schema‚Äô, and ‚Äòtext‚Äô

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‚Äòjson\_schema‚Äô

So therefore you should change

```
"type": "json"

```

to

```
"type": "json_schema"

```

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

***This docker image has outlived many students‚Äô hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.***

**Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?**  
What in the April Fools is this ![:unamused_face:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/unamused_face.png?v=14 ":unamused_face:")

> It hasn‚Äôt even been morning yet!

PS ( @carlton @Jivraj ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There‚Äôs something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

sir it seems like there was a problem when i pushed this files to the repo but i defenitely did correctly. PLease allow me to add docker file alone with your permission. As you can see i haven‚Äôt opened the dockerfile since the last date of project 1. Kindly allow this sir. and i have MiT license in my repo but still showing fail . kindly check that also sir.

I came pretty close, but too close(double entendre) to the deadline. Classic ICARUS stuff
