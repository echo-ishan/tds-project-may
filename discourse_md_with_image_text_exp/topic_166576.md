@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.

> Replying to @Saransh_Saini

@Saransh\_Saini  
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

```
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

```

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

@lakshaygarg654

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

```
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

```

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the *outermost layer* so you have to continue extracting it from the *inner layers* of the nested query.

```
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

```

Then the final layer of the nest

```
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

```

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

---

### Post #50 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *February 20, 2025*
> Replying to @daksh76

@daksh76 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

### Post #51 by **LAKSHAY** on *February 20, 2025*
> Replying to @carlton

Thank you for your response @carlton. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

1. **`json_extract`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
2. **`json_each`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
3. **`json_extract_path_text`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract\_path\_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**.

Thankyou

Create your gemini api, convert the video into MP4 and then write the Collab code for the question or ask gpt to write it for you…finally run it on google collab

Hi @Algsoch @24f2003130

While saving image you might need to pass lossless = True as argument.

`img.save("filename", lossless=True)`

kind regards

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

```
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

```

What it does is for each post\_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post\_id. Finally returns all the post\_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "
