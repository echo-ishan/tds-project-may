**“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”**  
So I did. ![:man_tipping_hand:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/man_tipping_hand.png?v=14 ":man_tipping_hand:")

### :dog_face::graduation_cap: *Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments* :books::laptop:

Yes, I got **great marks** in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.  
But let’s be real…

It was **my Labrador** who did the actual work ![:service_dog:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/service_dog.png?v=14 ":service_dog:")![:brain:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14 ":brain:")

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

* Solving **deployment issues** faster than my dev server boots
* Writing **function calling code** like a true GPT whisperer
* Fixing **LLM bugs** that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.  
He growled at broken APIs.  
I took the credit. ![:nail_polish:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/nail_polish.png?v=14 ":nail_polish:")

> I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.  
> But I am **personally offended** by one thing…”

> “How dare you give **bonus marks on Week 7**?  
> I skipped it — just like many — because we were told *only best 4 of 7 would count*.  
> I demand justice. And a belly rub.”

Let your pets help with your coursework.  
You get the grade. They get the rage.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t hurt him any further.
