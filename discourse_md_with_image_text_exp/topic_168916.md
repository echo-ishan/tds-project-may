Hi @carlton,  
My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.

Regards,  
Ajit

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by.

Kind regards

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.

Kind regards
