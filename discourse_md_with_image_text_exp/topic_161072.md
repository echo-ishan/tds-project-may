# Can I take the end-term exam without submitting assignments if I missed it due to an emergency?

### Post #1 by **Shiya Rajendra Ramteke** on *January 01, 2025*
I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.

The grading assignment indicates I’m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?

Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course,

I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify
