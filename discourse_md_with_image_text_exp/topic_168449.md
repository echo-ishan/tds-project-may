We have a **special** session scheduled for tonight from 8pm to 10pm. We will be sharing some important information during that session which will help you for your ROE. It is available in your google calendar.

The meet link for that session is:

ROE Preparation - TDS

Friday, February 28 · 8:00 – 10:00pm

Time zone: Asia/Kolkata

Video call link: https://meet.google.com/nnq-sxqh-ryw

The session will be recorded and live streamed on YouTube.  
It will be available on the TDS YouTube Playlist later.

## Kind regards, TDS Team

Dear Learner,

Please find the link to Mock ROE 3 below. Note the datasets links are present inside the given document (there are more than 1):

drive.google.com

### MOCK ROE 3.pdf

Google Drive file.

The estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins.

## All the best, TDS Team

### Update 3

#### 26/02/2025 8:11 pm

Dear Learner

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:

![](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/favicon.svg)
exam.sanand.workers.dev

### Technical Assessment

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

```

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

### Update 1

#### 25/02/2025 7:46pm

We have now closed the mock submissions.  
Both the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.

### Announcement

#### 25/02/2025

This same information is available in the seek portal as well.

The data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:

Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1

The questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:

https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6

IMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.

The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.

We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.

We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.

All the best!

@23f2003413

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

1. The chaos of ROE.
2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

### Post #19 by **Shubham Atkal** on *February 26, 2025*
Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

```
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

```

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

drive.google.com

### df\_gobindpur.csv

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

```
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

```

using this i got answer for 1st question as

```
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

```

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

@Jivraj @carlton  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.

What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40).

```
!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder

```

```
import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup




total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

        for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")

Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files:

1. `students.csv` has 2 columns:
2. studentId: A unique identifier for each student
3. class: The class (including section) of the student
4. `subjects.csv` has 2 columns:
5. studentId: The identifier for each student
6. subject: The name of the subject they have chosen

What are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order.

```
!unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/students.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/subjects.csv")
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on="studentId")
class_subject_counts = merged_df.groupby("class")["subject"].nunique()
lowest_subject_counts = class_subject_counts.nsmallest(3)

Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the Haversine distance.

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. ![:wink:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wink.png?v=12 ":wink:")  
Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

Kind regards

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.

Kind regards

Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping.

I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:")

There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once!

Mock ROE-1 & Mock ROE-2 sessions have not yet been uploaded in YouTube yet @carlton . Can you please upload both these videos at the earliest so that we could prepare from those videos. Many of us have no idea about how to solve these questions within the given timeframe, so it is highly appreciable that the team uploads these recorded live sessions in YT at the earliest. Thanks!

How many questions will we be having in our ROE?  
Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE

### Post #62 by **Carlton D'Silva** on *February 27, 2025*

It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried.

Kind regards

### Post #64 by **Trebhuvan SB** on *February 28, 2025*

I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions.

### Post #65 by **Saransh Saini** on *February 28, 2025*
> Replying to @trebhuvansb

Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

### Post #66 by **LAKSHAY** on *February 28, 2025*
Respected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton

Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.

As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.

I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Best Regards,  
Lakshay

Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming.

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
