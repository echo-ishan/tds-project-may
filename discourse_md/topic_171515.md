[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application:** The screenshot shows a page from **Google Sheets**, indicated by the logo and title at the top left.
2.  **Core Issue:** The central message, prominently displayed, is **"You need access"**. This indicates that the currently signed-in user does not have the necessary permissions to view or edit the specific Google Sheet they are trying to access.
3.  **Resolution Options:** The page provides two primary ways to resolve the access issue:
    *   "Request access" to the document.
    *   "switch to an account with access."
    *   A "Learn more" hyperlink is also present for additional information.
4.  **Access Request Interface:**
    *   An input field labeled **"Message (optional)"** allows the user to provide context or justification for their access request.
    *   A blue button labeled **"Request access"** is available to submit the request.
5.  **User Context:** The bottom of the screen clearly shows the account currently signed in: **"You're signed in as"** with the email address **"22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"**. This email domain (`ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) strongly suggests the user is a student or participant in a Data Science program at IIT Madras, which is highly relevant for a data science course forum.
6.  **Visuals:** An illustration on the right side depicts a person seemingly reaching through an opening in a document, visually reinforcing the concept of gaining access or being locked out.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code snippets, terminal commands, or specific error *codes* in this screenshot. The key messages and labels are:

*   **Title:** Google Sheets
*   **Main Heading:** You need access
*   **Instructional Text:** Request access, or switch to an account with access.
*   **Hyperlink Text:** Learn more
*   **Input Field Label:** Message (optional)
*   **Button Text:** Request access
*   **User Status Text:** You're signed in as
*   **User Email:** 22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in*



Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

### Key Information:

1.  **Assignment Type:** Students are required to create and share a Google Sheet workbook.
2.  **Naming Convention:** The Google Sheet workbook must be named specifically as `ga.7.1.rollno`. Students must replace the placeholder `'rollno'` with their individual IITM roll number, ensuring they exclude any domain part of the roll number.
3.  **Sharing Recipient:** The workbook must be shared with the email address `se2002@study.iitm.ac.in`.
4.  **Sharing Permissions:** The workbook must be shared with "editing rights."
5.  **Critical Submission Condition:** The sharing step (Task 2) is mandatory to be performed *first* and must be done when the workbook is still *blank*. Failure to follow this specific order and state will result in the submission not being considered.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There are no direct code blocks, shell commands, or explicit error messages present in this text. However, there are specific identifiers and naming conventions that function as instructions:

*   **File Naming Template:** `ga.7.1.rollno`
*   **Placeholder for Roll Number:** `'rollno'`
*   **Email Address for Sharing:** `se2002@study.iitm.ac.in`

**Full Transcription of the Tasks:**

```
Tasks:

1. Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook, named ga.7.1.rollno (replace 'rollno' with your IITM roll number excluding the domain).
2. Share with editing rights to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in. If you do not do this step first, on a blank workbook we will not consider your submission.
