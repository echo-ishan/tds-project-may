[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.



> **Image:** The user is trying to access a Google Sheet but does not have the necessary permissions, as indicated by the message "You need access." They are prompted to "Request access, or switch to an account with access." There is an optional text input field labeled "Message (optional)" where the user can provide context for their access request. A button labeled "Request access" allows the user to submit their request.  The user is currently signed in with the account "22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."



Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?



> **Image:** The screenshot outlines two tasks: creating a new blank Google Sheet workbook named "ga.7.1.rollno" (where "rollno" is replaced with the student's IITM roll number without the domain), and sharing the workbook with editing rights to "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in". The task emphasizes that the workbook shared must be a blank workbook. Failure to complete these steps will result in the submission not being considered. There are no visible code snippets, error messages, UI elements, data visualizations or charts present in the image.
