Hi Nilay,

In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)

kind regards

Hi [@22f3001315](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3001315) ,

You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.

Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body [Vision - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).

Kind regards

The API key is available at <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/>

The instructions on how to use the token is given at [GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

but the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI

### Post #16 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (Course TA, ds-students)

Hi Nilay,

Yes you would need to use `text-embedding-3-small` model of openai for embedding questions.

Kind regards

i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, **is there any solution to this problem?**

You can run two servers on different port numbers.

Hi Vikash,

I looked at your answers in backend. In answer you submitted response from openai, but you need to submit json object which is required for sending a request to LLM.

Kind regards

---

### Post #22 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (Course TA, ds-students)

You made same mistake here, instead of response use json body that’s required for sending request to LLM.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a Python coding exercise within a data science course, likely in a web-based interactive environment like Pyodide (indicated by the `_pyodide_base.py` paths in the traceback). The user is tasked with implementing a function but has encountered an error.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Key Information

1.  **Objective:** The user's primary task is to write a Python function named `most_similar` that takes an `embeddings` dictionary as input.
2.  **Input Data (`embeddings`):** The `embeddings` variable is a Python dictionary. Although only one key-value pair is visible, it's implied to contain multiple.
    *   **Keys:** Strings, representing phrases (e.g., `"Packaging was excellent."`).
    *   **Values:** Lists of floating-point numbers, representing numerical embeddings (vectors) for the corresponding phrases.
3.  **Required Function Logic:** The `most_similar` function must:
    *   Calculate the **cosine similarity** between *each pair* of these embedding vectors.
    *   Identify the pair of phrases (keys) that has the **highest similarity**.
    *   Return this pair of phrases as a **tuple**.
4.  **User's Code Area:** The text area labeled "Write your Python code here:" is currently empty. This suggests the user either cleared their code after running it and seeing the error, or the platform automatically clears it.
5.  **Error Encountered:** The user has received a `NameError`, indicating that the interpreter attempted to call or reference something named `most_similar` but could not find its definition.
6.  **Environment:** The traceback paths (`/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py`) clearly indicate that the code is being run in a Pyodide environment, which is Python compiled to WebAssembly, typically used in browsers.
7.  **Problem Cause (Inference):** The `NameError: name 'most_similar' is not defined` at `File "<exec>", line 5, in <module>` means that when the system tried to execute or test the user's code (likely by calling `most_similar(embeddings)`), it couldn't find a function or variable by that name. The most common reasons for this are:
    *   The user's submitted code did not include the `def most_similar(...)` function definition at all.
    *   There was a typo in the function name when defining it.
    *   The function was defined, but somehow not in the global scope where it was expected (e.g., nested inside another function, or an indentation error preventing its definition).

### Code, Commands, or Error Messages

**Input Data Example (partial):**
```python
embeddings = {"Packaging was excellent.":[-0.01674579456448555, -0.06481242924928665, -0.24050545692443848, 0.042519159615039825, 0.14857585728]
```
*(Note: The full `embeddings` dictionary content is truncated in the image.)*

**Problem Description/Instructions:**
```
Your task is to write a Python function most_similar(embeddings) that will calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of these embeddings and return the pair that has the highest similarity. The result should be a tuple of the two phrases that are most similar.

Write your Python code here:
```

**Error Message (Exact Traceback):**
```
PythonError: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py", line 523, in eval_code.run(globals, locals) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File "/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py", line 357, in run coroutine = eval(self.code, globals, locals) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File "<exec>", line 5, in <module> NameError: name 'most_similar' is not defined
```*



For question no.6, there was some pre-written code there, right?  
I am not able to see it now.

> **Image Content:** *Here's a detailed analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The user is operating within a PowerShell (PS) terminal on a Windows system.
2.  **Current Directory:** The current working directory is `C:\Users\Varad\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\Temp\TDS\`.
3.  **Action Performed:** The user executed a Python script named `request.py`. The `-u` flag for Python typically means unbuffered standard output and error streams.
4.  **Error Type:** The execution resulted in an API error.
5.  **Specific Error:** The error message clearly indicates an `"insufficient_quota"` issue. This means the user has exceeded the usage limits or budget set for their account with the API they are trying to access.
6.  **API Provider Hint:** The error message includes a direct link to OpenAI's API error documentation (`https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.`). This strongly suggests that the `request.py` script is attempting to interact with an OpenAI API (e.g., for GPT models, DALL-E, etc.).
7.  **Resolution Advice:** The error message advises the user to "check your plan and billing details" to resolve the quota issue.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **Command Executed:**
    ```
    python -u "C:\Users\Varad\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\Temp\TDS\request.py"
    ```

*   **Error Message Output:**
    ```
    {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum, detailing the key information and transcribing the code and error messages.

### Key Information

1.  **Purpose of the Code:** The Python code is designed to interact with a conversational AI API (strongly suggested to be OpenAI due to the error message URL and nature). It constructs a prompt within a `messages` structure, typical for chat completion APIs, and sends it via an HTTP POST request. The goal of the prompt is to "List only the valid English words" from a given string of alphanumeric characters.

2.  **API Interaction:**
    *   The code uses the `requests` library to make an `HTTP POST` request to a specified `url`.
    *   It sends `headers` and a JSON payload (`json=data`). While the `data` variable itself is not explicitly defined in the visible code, the structure immediately preceding `response = requests.post(...)` strongly implies it's the `data` being sent.
    *   The payload structure is a list containing a dictionary with a "user" role and a "content" field.

3.  **Error Handling:** The script includes a conditional check for the API response status code:
    *   If `response.status_code` is `200` (success), it attempts to parse and pretty-print the JSON response.
    *   If `response.status_code` is anything else, it prints a custom message indicating the failure, the status code, and the raw `response.text` for debugging.

4.  **Observed Problem/Error:**
    *   The API request *failed*.
    *   The printed status code is `429`. This HTTP status code typically means "Too Many Requests," often indicating rate limiting or, in this specific case, a quota issue.
    *   The `response.text` clearly explains the reason for the failure: the user has **exceeded their current quota** for the API.

5.  **Resolution Indicated by Error:** The error message directs the user to "check your plan and billing details" on the OpenAI platform, providing a direct link for more information.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages

**Code Snippet:**

```python
[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "List only the valid English words from these: B2k, D, G1r, ywpIVSQ, CR3XfA, dSVNJZip, "
                   "dwq, zP, G31JcO, VHXlo, 1Su, aAZw, pfgBKpU, wRUPir, Go, n1Da, OMdJGxaVBk, OIrRH6x, "
                   "8zKs, UCX, 6XxK2bUYV4, A, jjxz, gv, P, xKyD, qn54IR2t"
    }
]

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Check for successful response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text) # Print the error response for debugging
```

**Output/Error Message:**

```
Request failed with status code: 429
{
  "error": {
    "message": "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/gui",
    "type": "insufficient_quota",
    "param": null,
    "code": "insufficient_quota"
  }
}
```*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python script designed to interact with the OpenAI Chat Completions API. It's likely from a coding exercise or demonstration within a data science course, focusing on natural language processing and API integration.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Endpoint and Headers Configuration:**
*   The script targets the OpenAI Chat Completions API, specifically:
    `url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`
*   It configures the necessary HTTP headers for authentication and content type:
    ```python
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer (key)", # Placeholder for the actual API key
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    ```
    *   **Key Information:** This sets up the foundation for sending a request to OpenAI's language model. The `(key)` indicates that an API key needs to be provided by the user for authentication.

**2. User Input (Prompt):**
*   A multi-line string `user_message` defines the prompt sent to the language model:
    ```
    user_message = """list only the valid English words from these: QZYRPZBS, QZygJiM, JfCKu, GSGne, D, HQRWHZT, JDSnRGS, m, KS, INdUCLe, SjpZMl, ucnugpkse, HS4, 9, PYRWTUR, ReSWDZI, AY, RWAHJpS, E, eHCteCE, TiZT, Vckd"""
    ```
    *   **Key Information:** The task for the AI is clearly defined: to filter a given list of mixed-case, alphanumeric strings and identify only the valid English words. This demonstrates a text cleaning or filtering application.

**3. API Payload Preparation:**
*   The `data` dictionary prepares the JSON payload for the API request:
    ```python
    data = {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini", # Use the gpt-4 model
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_message}], # Messages format
    }
    ```
    *   **Key Information:** This specifies the AI model to be used (`gpt-4o-mini`) and formats the user's input according to the OpenAI Chat API's `messages` structure, where `role` is "user" and `content` is the `user_message`.

**4. Sending the API Request:**
*   The `requests` library is used to send a POST request:
    `response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)`
    *   **Key Information:** This is the core action where the configured request is sent to the OpenAI server.

**5. Response Parsing and Error Handling:**
*   The script parses the JSON response from the API:
    `response_json = response.json()`
*   It then checks the HTTP status code to determine if the request was successful:
    ```python
    if response.status_code == 200:
        input_tokens = response_json.get("usage", {}).get("total_tokens", "N/A")
        print(f"Input tokens used: {input_tokens}")
    else:
        print(f"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}: {response_json}")
    ```
    *   **Key Information:** This section demonstrates robust API interaction by checking for a successful response (`status_code == 200`). If successful, it extracts the number of `total_tokens` used for the input (from the `usage` field). If the request fails, it prints an informative error message including the status code and the full JSON response, which would typically contain error details from the API. The `.get()` method with default values is used for safe dictionary access.

**6. Output:**
*   At the very bottom of the screenshot, the output of the executed script is visible:
    `Input tokens used: 644`
    *   **Key Information:** This confirms that the API call was successful and indicates that the input prompt consumed 644 tokens. This metric is important for understanding the cost and efficiency of API calls.

**Overall Context:**
The script demonstrates a fundamental pattern for interacting with large language models via their APIs: setting up the request, providing a prompt, sending the request, and processing the response, including error handling and extracting relevant metrics like token usage. The specific task of identifying English words showcases a basic text processing capability of the LLM.*

Hello Sir,

I am unable to recieve a proper output for q1 of ga3.  
This is my test message. Its been given in two lines.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Format and Context:** The image displays text within what appears to be a code block, console output, or a text editor snippet, indicated by the dark background, monospace font, and the presence of a line number. This is typical for sharing code, command line interactions, or error messages in a technical forum.
2.  **Line Numbering:** The number "2" is present at the beginning of the first line and is colored blue. This strongly suggests line numbering, a common feature in code editors and for referencing specific lines in discussions or error logs.
3.  **Syntax Highlighting:** The character "G" on the second line is highlighted in green. This indicates syntax highlighting, which is used in programming environments to distinguish different elements (like keywords, variables, operators, or specific values) of a language. Without more context, the specific meaning of "G" in green cannot be determined, but it implies it has a special significance within the context from which this snippet was taken.
4.  **Content Type (Ambiguous):** The alphanumeric strings themselves (`b7 rkS94mn4`, `AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS`) do not immediately resemble typical, readable programming code (e.g., Python, R, SQL) or a standard error message without further context. They could be:
    *   Randomly generated identifiers or keys.
    *   Hashed values or encrypted strings.
    *   Output from a specific command or function.
    *   A unique ID or token.
    *   Part of a configuration file or a log entry.
    *   A "placeholder" or example string within a larger discussion.

**Transcription:**

Here is the exact transcription of the text as it appears in the screenshot:

```
2 b7 rkS94mn4
AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS
```

**Notes on Transcription Details:**
*   The `2` is blue.
*   The `G` is green.
*   All other characters are a light grey/white against the dark background.*



The below is my code for the question.

```
import httpx

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

system_message = "Analyze the input message if it's  GOOD , BAD or NEUTRAL."
user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4  AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"

payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},  # System message
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}       # One user message
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7
}

response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

for choice in result["choices"]:
    print("AI Response:", choice["message"]["content"])

```

I tried to put the two test lines as two user messages but received an error stating that the json body must contain only 2 messages with one mandatorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a fragment of code being written or executed, followed by a specific error message.

1.  **Code Context:** The line `payload = {` suggests the user is defining a dictionary or JSON object named `payload`. This is a common structure for sending data in API requests or for configuring tasks in data science workflows (e.g., specifying parameters for a model, defining a message for a queuing system).
2.  **Error Indication:** A prominent red line under the code indicates an error has occurred, which is typical for integrated development environments (IDEs) or online code editors highlighting problem areas.
3.  **Error Message Content:** The error message states, "The user message must be [specific string], not [specific string]". The crucial and most perplexing aspect of this error is that the "must be" value and the "not" value are *identical*. This suggests a logical flaw in the validation or comparison logic of the system generating the error. It's effectively saying "X must be X, but it's X," which is contradictory and unhelpful for debugging.
4.  **Nature of the "User Message":** The string `2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpl G LeeHS` appears to be some form of identifier, hash, or unique token, rather than a human-readable message. This implies the error is related to a system-level constraint or a specific expected value for an internal "user message" parameter, perhaps for authentication, session management, or message integrity.

**Potential Problem:** The error message itself is highly misleading due to the identical "must be" and "not" values. This indicates a potential bug in the underlying system's error handling or validation code. The user is being told their input (or a system-generated value) doesn't match an expected value, even though the error claims they are identical. This would make it very difficult for the user to understand and resolve the issue without external context or debugging tools for the system itself.

**Transcription:**

*   **Code/Command:**
    ```
    payload = {
    ```
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Error: The user message must be 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpl G LeeHS, not 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpl G LeeHS
    ```*



Kindly advice on how to proceed.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hi Shalini,

Your `user_message` is incorrect. I looked at your exact GA and it works if you make sure your `user_message` is precisely what is given to you.

Hint: How do you store a multi-line variable in python?

Kind regards

I am getting below error for Q6 if i am importing sklearn libarary  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a `PythonError` traceback from a Pyodide environment, indicating that a required module, `scipy`, could not be found.

---

### Key Information:

*   **Error Type:** `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   **Missing Module:** The specific module that could not be found is `'scipy'`.
*   **Environment Context:** The traceback paths (`/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py`) and the suggested solutions (`micropip.install`, `pyodide.loadPackage`) clearly indicate that this error occurred within a **Pyodide** runtime environment (Python running in the browser/WebAssembly).
*   **Root Cause (as explained by the error message):** While `scipy` is "included in the Pyodide distribution," it is "not installed" in the current active environment. This means it needs to be explicitly loaded or installed before use.
*   **Probable User Code Location:** The error `File "<exec>", line 4, in <module>` suggests that the attempt to import or use `scipy` occurred on the **4th line** of the user's script or interactive code block.
*   **Recommended Solutions:**
    *   **For Python:** Use `await micropip.install("scipy")`. This is Pyodide's equivalent of `pip install` for installing packages.
    *   **For JavaScript (if integrating with JS):** Use `await pyodide.loadPackage("scipy")`.
*   **Further Documentation:** A direct link to Pyodide's documentation on loading packages is provided for more details.

For those who want to experiment with GPT-4o Mini (or other models), [Github Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) is free. You can explore and compare models, including GPT-4o Mini, DeepSeek R1, and others.

It has rate limits, so you can’t use it in production, but is a good place to prototype applications and experiment with prompts.

### Post #81 by **Tanmay Garg** (ds-students)

Hi guys, just wanted to share that I found it hysterical when I saw this question:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online assignment or exam from a data science course, likely related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and API interaction.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Context & Metadata:**
*   **Course/Exam:** "Graded Assignment 3 :: IITM Online" (from tab title), "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Lang" (from tab title). The URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3` confirms it's an exam environment.
*   **Due Date:** Wed 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST
*   **Current Score:** 1 / 9.5
*   **Task Type:** Writing a JSON request body for an OpenAI chat completion API call, without needing to execute it or use an API key.

**2. Problem Statement:**
RapidRoute Solutions is a logistics company that needs to generate realistic, standardized U.S. addresses using a language model (OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini). The addresses must be returned as structured JSON data with no additional properties.

**3. Specific Requirements for the OpenAI Chat Completion Call (JSON Body):**
The JSON body to be sent to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` must adhere to the following specifications:
*   **Model:** `gpt-4o-mini`
*   **System Message:** `Respond in JSON`
*   **User Message:** `Generate 10 random addresses in the US`
*   **Structured Output (JSON Schema):** The response must contain an object named `addresses` which is an array of objects. Each object within this array must have the following **required fields**:
    *   `apartment` (string)
    *   `zip` (number)
    *   `latitude` (number)
*   **`additionalProperties` setting:** Must be set to `false` for every object in the schema.

**4. Code/Commands/Error Messages (Transcribed Exactly):**

*   **Hints/Warnings (at the top of the page, acting as schema validation guidance):**
    ```
    "type": "string", ... which is a string.
    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"]: ⚠️ You must add "required": [...] and include all fields in the object.
    "additionalProperties": false: ⚠️ OpenAI requires every object to have "additionalProperties": false.
    ```

*   **Explicit API Endpoint:**
    `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

*   **Detailed Requirements (from bullet points):**
    *   Uses model `gpt-4o-mini`
    *   Has a system message: `Respond in JSON`
    *   Has a user message: `Generate 10 random addresses in the US`
    *   Uses structured outputs to respond with an object `addresses` which is an array of objects with required fields: `apartment (string) zip (number) latitude (number)`.
    *   Sets `additionalProperties` to `false` to prevent additional properties.

*   **Instruction regarding the answer box:**
    `There's no answer box above. Figure out how to enable it. That's part of the test.`

**5. User's Current State:**
The user has a score of 1 out of 9.5, indicating they might have partially completed the task or a previous part of the assignment. The challenge now is to determine the correct JSON body for the OpenAI API call based on the detailed requirements, and to figure out how to input it into the system.*



  
Like I literally showed this question to my mother and younger bro, stating the fact we ourselves had enable the answer box, they laughed there pants off…  
More courses could be like this.

### Post #83 by **Andrew David** (ds-students)
*February 04, 2025, 14:05 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's a breakdown of the key information:

### **Key Information**

1.  **User's Task:** The user is required to write a Python function named `most_similar` that takes `embeddings` as input. The function should calculate the cosine similarity between every pair of these embeddings, identify the pair with the highest similarity, and return a tuple containing the two phrases corresponding to those most similar embeddings.

2.  **Code Provided by User:**
    The user has started to implement the function. The code within the interactive environment is:

    ```python
    import numpy

    def most_similar(embeddings):
        # Your code here
        return (phrase1, phrase2)
    ```

    *   **Visual Cues:**
        *   A red wavy underline appears under `numpy` in the `import numpy` line, along with a small red circle with an exclamation mark at the top-right corner of the code editor, typically indicating a warning or an issue with the import (e.g., `numpy` not found or an unused import warning by a linter).
        *   A red wavy underline also appears under `most_similar` in the function definition `def most_similar(embeddings):`, which could suggest a linter warning (e.g., function not called, or potentially an issue with its definition if not for the NameError).
        *   A button or label displaying "Incorrect answer" is visible, indicating that the submitted code did not pass the automated checks.

3.  **Error Message:**
    The code execution results in a `NameError`. The full traceback is provided:

    ```
    PythonError: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py", line 523, in eval_code.run(globals, locals) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File "/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py", line 357, in run coroutine = eval(self.code, globals, locals) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File "<module>", line 11, in <module> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File "<exec>", line 8, in most_similar NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined
    ```

### **Analysis of the Problem**

*   **Core Issue:** The primary error is a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined`. This occurs because the user's `return (phrase1, phrase2)` statement attempts to return variables `phrase1` and `phrase2`, but these variables have not been assigned any values within the `most_similar` function's scope.
*   **Incomplete Implementation:** The comment `# Your code here` clearly indicates that the essential logic for calculating cosine similarity, identifying the most similar pair, and assigning the corresponding phrases to `phrase1` and `phrase2` is missing.
*   **Purpose of `import numpy`:** The user correctly anticipates using `numpy` for numerical operations, which is crucial for calculating cosine similarity between embeddings (which are typically numerical vectors). While the red squiggle suggests a potential issue with `numpy` itself or its environment, it's not the root cause of the current `NameError`. The `NameError` occurs because the function tries to use variables that haven't been defined yet, regardless of `numpy`'s availability.
*   **Environment Clue:** The traceback paths (`/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py`) suggest that the code is being run in a Pyodide environment, which is a version of Python compiled to WebAssembly, allowing it to run in web browsers.

### **Summary of Next Steps for the User**

The user needs to:
1.  Implement the logic within the `most_similar` function to:
    *   Iterate through all unique pairs of embeddings.
    *   Calculate the cosine similarity for each pair. NumPy's `dot` product and `linalg.norm` functions are commonly used for this.
    *   Keep track of the pair of phrases that yields the maximum cosine similarity.
    *   Assign these identified phrases to `phrase1` and `phrase2` before the `return` statement.
2.  Ensure `numpy` is correctly imported and available in the execution environment, though this is secondary to resolving the `NameError`.*

*February 04, 2025, 14:05 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online data science course or assignment platform, specifically a section related to deploying and testing an API (Application Programming Interface). The user is being prompted to provide the URL endpoint for their API implementation.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Contextual Instruction:**
    *   A prompt at the top advises: "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin." This indicates that the user's API server needs to be configured to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the testing platform to access it.

2.  **API Endpoint Request:**
    *   **Question:** "What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation?"
    *   **Example Provided:** "It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`" This gives the user a common local development URL and a specific endpoint path (`/execute`) to aim for.

3.  **User Input & Error:**
    *   **Input Field Content:** The user has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` into the designated input field.
    *   **Visual Error Indicator:** The input field has a red border and a small red exclamation mark icon, signifying an issue with the entered URL or its response.
    *   **Error Message (Critical Information):** Below the input field, a red error message is displayed, indicating the problem encountered during a check.

4.  **API Verification Process Description:**
    *   The platform explains how it will test the provided API endpoint: "We'll check by sending a GET request to this URL with `?q=...` containing a task. We'll verify that it matches the expected response. Arguments must be in the same order as the function definition."
    *   This tells the user:
        *   The request method will be **GET**.
        *   A query parameter named **`q`** will be used to send the "task" data.
        *   The API's response will be validated against an **expected response**.
        *   The order of arguments in the API's function definition is important.

5.  **Action Button:**
    *   A blue button labeled "Check" is present at the bottom, which the user would click to submit their URL and initiate the verification process.

---

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   **Example API URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`
*   **User Input in field:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`
*   **Error Message:** `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON`
*   **Query Parameter Example:** `?q=...`*



  
This is in context to Q8. This is a screenshot of the response I am getting when i run the same API on my FastAPI/docs response page, it gives the correct response. But when I check it on the assignment page i get the following error. If you would like to know the code, pls let me know.

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding 7th and 8th question. I am getting this error of expecting three matches while saving. But, Externally when I check this API, I tried considerable test cases, and I am getting the output correctly. Can you please check this and give a solution. Thank You  


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a data structure, most likely a Python dictionary or a JSON object, printed to the console or as an output in a data science environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, terminal).

*   **Data Type:** The output is a dictionary.
*   **Key-Value Pair:** It contains a single key-value pair.
    *   **Key:** The key is the string `'matches'`.
    *   **Value:** The value associated with the `'matches'` key is a list (or array) of strings.
*   **List Elements:** The list contains three string elements: `'banana'`, `'watermelon'`, and `'jamaica'`.
*   **Likely Context:** In a data science context, this structure commonly represents the result of:
    *   A string matching or pattern recognition operation where "matches" were found.
    *   A feature extraction process, where `'banana'`, `'watermelon'`, and `'jamaica'` are identified entities or categories.
    *   A small sample of data returned from an API call or a database query.
The choice of words (fruits and a country/island) might suggest a natural language processing task, a data cleaning operation, or categorization of items.

**Transcription:**

```
{'matches': ['banana', 'watermelon', 'jamaica']}

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum or an interactive lesson, likely related to setting up and testing an API endpoint. The user is attempting to provide the URL for their API implementation.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **CORS Instruction:**
    *   **Text:** `Make sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers.`
    *   **Analysis:** This is a crucial prerequisite instruction. It advises the user to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on their API server. Specifically, it highlights the need to allow `OPTIONS` (preflight requests) and `POST` methods, and possibly to be lenient with origins and headers to prevent cross-origin policy issues. This suggests the API will be called from a different domain/port than it is hosted on.

2.  **API URL Endpoint Prompt:**
    *   **Text:** `What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`
    *   **Analysis:** The system is prompting the user to enter the URL of their API. It provides an example URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`, which is a common pattern for local development servers (localhost IP `127.0.0.1`, common development port `8000`, and a specific endpoint path `/similarity`). The endpoint name "similarity" hints that this API might be for a text similarity, image similarity, or embedding comparison task, common in data science.

3.  **User Input and Error Indication:**
    *   **Input Field Content:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`
    *   **Visual Cues:** The input field has a red border and a red exclamation mark icon on the right. This universally indicates an error or a validation issue with the entered value.
    *   **Analysis:** The user has entered *exactly* the example URL provided by the system. Despite this, the system is flagging it as problematic.

4.  **Error Message:**
    *   **Text:** `Error: Expected 3 matches`
    *   **Analysis:** This is the specific error message encountered. "Expected 3 matches" is a cryptic error in this context. It strongly suggests a pattern matching or regular expression validation failure.
        *   It implies that the system is trying to parse or extract components from the provided URL (e.g., protocol, host, port, path segments) using a pattern that expects exactly three distinct "matches" or capture groups.
        *   Since the user entered the suggested URL, there are two primary possibilities:
            1.  **Flawed Validation Logic:** The course platform's URL validation pattern/regex is incorrect or overly strict for the given example.
            2.  **Misunderstanding of "Matches":** The "3 matches" refers to something other than simple URL components, perhaps specific content expected *within* the URL path that the simple `/similarity` endpoint doesn't satisfy, or that the validation expects *additional* path segments or parameters (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/model/version/similarity`). However, the latter contradicts the example provided.

**In summary:** The user has followed the instructions by entering the suggested API endpoint URL, but the system's internal validation, likely a regular expression or parsing logic, is failing with a non-descriptive error message "Expected 3 matches." The CORS instruction remains relevant for the actual API communication, but the immediate issue is URL validation.*

*February 04, 2025, 17:52 UTC*
This is regarding the 8th question. Same here, I am getting the answer for all the test cases, but then also, I am getting error in the portal while saving. Please help me out here. Thank You.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser interacting with a local API endpoint, likely as part of a demonstration or exercise in a data science course, possibly related to **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and function calling, or building API services**.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **API Endpoint and Query:**
    *   The user is accessing an API running on their local machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.
    *   The specific endpoint is `/execute/`.
    *   The query parameter `q` is used to send a natural language-like command or request to the API.
    *   The query string sent is URL-encoded: `"%22Calculate%20performance%20bonus%20for%20employee%2010056%20for%202025.%22`.
        *   Decoding this, the original human-readable query was: `"Calculate performance bonus for employee 10056 for 2025."`
        *   The double quotes around the entire phrase suggest that the input is expected to be a string.

2.  **API Response (JSON Output):**
    *   The API responds with a JSON object.
    *   The browser's "Pretty-print" feature is active, indicating that the raw JSON response is being formatted for readability.
    *   The JSON response clearly indicates that the API has successfully "understood" the natural language query and translated it into a structured function call.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **URL (Command/Request):**
    `127.0.0.1:8001/execute/?q=%22Calculate%20performance%20bonus%20for%20employee%2010056%20for%202025.%22`

*   **JSON Response (Output):**
    `{ "name": "calculate_performance_bonus", "arguments": "{\"employee_id\": 10056, \\"current_year\\": 2025}" }`

*   **UI Text:**
    `Pretty-print`

**Detailed Explanation of the JSON Response:**

The JSON response `{ "name": "calculate_performance_bonus", "arguments": "{\"employee_id\": 10056, \\"current_year\\": 2025}" }` represents a common pattern in **function calling** or **tool use** in modern AI systems (like those built with LLMs).

*   **`"name": "calculate_performance_bonus"`**: This field specifies the name of the function or action that the system determined should be executed based on the user's natural language query. It indicates an intention to compute a performance bonus.
*   **`"arguments": "{\"employee_id\": 10056, \\"current_year\\": 2025}"`**: This field contains the arguments required by the `calculate_performance_bonus` function.
    *   Crucially, the value of `arguments` is a *string* that itself contains a JSON object. Notice the escaped double quotes (`\"`). This means that after parsing the outer JSON, this `arguments` string would need to be *parsed again* as a separate JSON string to extract the actual parameters.
    *   The parsed arguments would be:
        *   `"employee_id": 10056`
        *   `"current_year": 2025`

This setup suggests an architecture where a front-end or orchestrator sends a natural language query to an "intent recognition" or "function calling" API, which then returns the structured call information. Another part of the system (or the same one) would then take this structured call and execute the `calculate_performance_bonus` function with the provided arguments. This is a fundamental concept in building robust AI agents and applications.*



  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays a user interface element where a user is prompted to enter an API URL endpoint. The system provides an example of what the URL might look like. The user has entered a URL, and the system has responded with an error, indicating that it failed to connect or retrieve data from the specified endpoint.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Prompt/Question:**
    What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like:
*   **Example URL (from prompt):**
    `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`
*   **User Input (in the input field):**
    `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute`
*   **Error Message:**
    `TypeError: Failed to fetch`*

I GOT THE CORRECT ANSWER F0R QUES 7 & 8 STILL MY SCORE IS SHOWING 8 DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS ?  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays the instructions for an exam or quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language Models". The instructions outline the rules and expectations for participants, particularly regarding how to approach the questions, use resources, and technical requirements.

*   **Course/Exam Details:** The exam is part of "TDS 2025 Jan GA3" and focuses on "Large Language Models."
*   **Learning Approach:** Participants are encouraged to learn what they need but are free to skip reading material if they already know the answer. Learning "just for pleasure" is also mentioned.
*   **Checking & Saving:**
    *   Answers can be checked multiple times to see if they are right or wrong.
    *   Answers should be saved regularly, as the last saved submission will be evaluated.
    *   Answers are saved locally in the browser, not on a server. Reloading the page is permissible.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   The browser may struggle with loading issues, and users are advised to turn off security restrictions or try a different browser if this occurs.
    *   Questions generally won't change, except for randomized parameters.
*   **Allowed Resources:** Participants are explicitly allowed to use "anything," including the internet, ChatGPT, friends, and any libraries or frameworks. This indicates an open-book, collaborative, and tool-assisted environment.
*   **"Hackable" Quiz:** Unusually, it's stated that it's possible and "allowed" to get answers to *some* questions by "hacking the code for this quiz."
*   **Critical Note (Server Requirement):** A crucial technical instruction indicates that multiple servers will be used in the exam, and "All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers." This suggests a hands-on, possibly code-execution based, assessment.
*   **Support:** A clear call to action to "Join the discussion on Discourse" is provided for any questions.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no traditional code blocks or error messages. However, there are command-like words appearing as button text, which are transcribed as requested:

*   `Check`
*   `Save`*

To this question I have checked values ranging from 6 to 13 none of them are correct, using openAI Tokenizer online tool.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot, detailing the key information, and transcribing code/commands/error messages exactly as they appear:

**1. General Context & Environment:**

*   **Platform:** Appears to be an online examination or assignment platform hosted at `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3`.
*   **Course/Subject:** Likely related to Data Science, given the "TDS 2025 Jan" tab and the "LLM Token Cost" question.
*   **Navigation:** Standard browser tabs are open, including "My Dashboard", "Graded Assig", "GA3 - Large L", "TDS 2025 Jan", "Async DB Set", "uv: Python pa", "Running scrip", and a local address "127.0.0.1:800".
*   **Time & Score:**
    *   Time remaining: `08:04:14 left`
    *   Current Score: `0 / 9.5`
*   **Interaction Buttons (Top):** `Check all`, `Save`
*   **User Status:** "Verify it's you" in the top right corner.
*   **System Status (Bottom right):** `15:55`, `05-02-2025`, `ENG`
*   **Operating System Prompt:** "Activate Windows" is visible at the bottom right, suggesting the user's local machine is not activated.

**2. Question Details: "LLM Token Cost"**

*   **Question Number:** 2
*   **Marks:** 0.75 marks
*   **Scenario/Background:**
    *   `LexiSolve Inc. is a startup that delivers a conversational AI platform to enterprise clients. The system leverages OpenAI's language models to power a variety of customer service, sentiment analysis, and data extraction features. Because pricing for these models is based on the number of tokens processed—and strict token limits apply—accurate token accounting is critical for managing costs and ensuring system stability.`
    *   `To optimize operational costs and prevent unexpected API overages, the engineering team at LexiSolve has developed an internal diagnostic tool that simulates and measures token usage for typical prompts sent to the language model.`
*   **Task:**
    *   `One specific test case an understanding of text tokenization. Your task is to generate data for that test case.`
    *   `Specifically, when you make a request to OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini with just this user message:`

*   **User Message (Exact Transcription):**
    ```
    List only the valid English words from these:
    ```
    *(Note: This text is displayed within a black box, indicating it is the content of the user message.)*

*   **Prompt/Question to Answer:**
    `... how many input tokens does it use up?`

*   **Input Field for Answer:**
    `Number of tokens:` (followed by an empty text input field)

*   **Important Hint/Note:**
    `Remember: indicating that this is a user message takes up a few extra tokens. You actually need to make the request to get the answer.`
    *(This implies the user needs to account for message role tokens and potentially use a tokenizer library or API call to find the precise number of tokens for the given message with the "user" role for the GPT-4o-Mini model.)*

**3. Interaction Elements (Specific to Question):**

*   `Check` button below the question's input field.

**Summary:**

The screenshot displays a question from an online data science exam focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) and tokenization. The user is asked to determine the exact number of input tokens used by a specific user message when sent to OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini model. A crucial hint indicates that the "user" role itself adds tokens, implying the need to accurately simulate or query the API's tokenization logic rather than just counting words. The user needs to input a numerical answer into a provided field.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the OpenAI Tokenizer tool, accessible via `platform.openai.com/tokenizer`. This tool is designed to visualize how text is broken down into "tokens" by large language models, a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP).

    *   **Tokenization Visualization:** The input text is color-coded, with each color representing a distinct token. The spaces leading most words are included as part of the token (e.g., " only", " the").
        *   `List` (purple)
        *   ` only` (orange)
        *   ` the` (pink)
        *   ` valid` (green)
        *   ` English` (blue)
        *   ` words` (yellow)
        *   ` from` (light blue/cyan)
        *   ` these` (red)
        *   `;` (light purple/lavender)
    *   **Calculated Metrics:**
        *   **Tokens:** `10`
        *   **Characters:** `47`

4.  **Contextual Information Provided by OpenAI:**

Keep getting this error.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online assessment or lab environment for a data science or AI course, likely focused on API development and interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). The user is currently attempting a question related to similarity matching and is encountering an error.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assessment Context:**
*   **Platform:** A custom online exam/lab platform, URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3`.
*   **Time Remaining:** 07:38:35 left.
*   **Score:** Current score is 0/9.5.
*   **Actions:** "Check all" and "Save" buttons are available.
*   **Date & Time (System):** 16:21 on 05-02-2025 (February 5th, 2025).

**2. Current Question Details (Similarity Matching API):**
*   **Task:** Implement an API endpoint for similarity matching.
*   **Expected API Response Format:** The grading system expects a JSON response that looks like this:
    ```json
    {
      "matches": ["Contents of document 3", "Contents of document 1", "Contents of document 2"]
    }
    ```
    *   **Note:** The problem statement clarifies, "Here, 'Contents of document 3' is considered the closest match, followed by 'Contents of document 1', then 'Contents of document 2'."
*   **CORS Requirement:** "Make sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers." This is a critical setup detail for the API.
*   **API URL Input:** The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` into the input field for their API endpoint. This indicates they are running a local server.
*   **Validation Method:** "We'll check by sending a POST request to this URL with a JSON body containing random `docs` and `query`." This specifies how the grading system will test the student's API.
*   **Check Button:** A "Check" button is present to submit the API URL for validation.

**3. Error Message:**
*   Below the API URL input field, a red error message is displayed:
    ```
    Error: Got incorrect matches: Our customer feedback survey revealed that ease of use is a key area for improvement.,The infrastructure upgrade includes improvements in data storage and retrieval.,The technical documentation for the new product line is now available online.
    ```
    *   **Analysis of Error:** The first part, "Got incorrect matches," clearly indicates a functional error with the API's output. However, the rest of the message ("Our customer feedback survey...") appears to be extraneous, possibly placeholder text or a misconfigured/buggy error message within the assessment platform itself, rather than a direct diagnostic of the user's code.

**4. Next Question/Section:**
*   **Question Number & Marks:** "8 Function Calling (1.5 marks)"
*   **Topic:** "Function Calling with OpenAI"
*   **Description:** "Function Calling allows Large Language Models to convert natural language into structured function calls. This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems." This confirms the course's focus on modern AI/LLM applications.

**5. Operating System and Browser Environment:**
*   **Browser:** Google Chrome (visible tabs and interface elements).
*   **Operating System:** Windows (taskbar visible at the bottom with "Activate Windows" overlay, taskbar icons like VS Code, Notepad, etc.).
*   **Open Tabs (in Chrome):** My Dash, Graded, GA3 - L, TDS 202, Async D, uv: Python, Running, 127.0.0.1, 4.75+1.5, Tokenize, You can. These tabs suggest a development environment with various tools, local server instances (like `127.0.0.1`), and potentially course materials or documentation.*

Try sending an api call to openai.

Check with network tab, you would see the response of api call being made, Compare that with expected output.

Regrading question 8, you would need to check if cors are enabled, check in browser console tab for more.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser's developer tools, specifically the **Network tab**, which is commonly used by developers and data scientists to inspect and debug web requests, especially when dealing with APIs that provide data.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Context:**
*   The user is operating a Chromium-based browser (likely Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge).
*   Multiple tabs are open, including "Titanic dataset - Go..." and "IIT Madras BS Foun...", suggesting an academic or data science-related context.
*   The primary focus is on the developer console, indicating the user is either debugging a web application, inspecting data flows, or troubleshooting an issue.

**2. Network Tab State:**
*   The "Network" tab is active, showing network requests made by the web page.
*   The filter "Fetch/XHR" is selected, meaning the user is specifically looking at XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API calls, which are typical for asynchronous data retrieval from backend services.
*   "Preserve log" and "Disable cache" are unchecked.
*   "No throttling" is selected, indicating full network speed is being simulated.

**3. Network Requests Overview:**
*   **Number of requests:** "2 requests" were made.
*   **Data transferred:** "773 B transferred".
*   **Resources:** "48 B resources".
*   The requests completed very quickly, within the first 1000 ms.

**4. Specific Request Details (Selected Request):**
*   **Request Name:** The two requests have nearly identical names, which appear to be partial URLs or endpoints. They both start with `1.0?` and include query parameters.
*   **Key Query Parameters Visible:**
    *   `cors=true`: Indicates that the request is configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is essential for web applications making requests to different domains.
    *   `content-type=application/x-json-stre...`: Suggests the expected content type of the response is a JSON stream. The `...` indicates the full value is truncated, but it likely refers to `application/x-json-stream` or similar.
*   **Response Tab Active:** The "Response" tab is selected, displaying the raw content returned by the server for the highlighted (top) request.

**5. Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **Network Request Names (partial):**
    *   `1.0?cors=true&content-type=application/x-json-stre...6V%3D4%26LU...`
    *   `1.0?cors=true&content-type=application/x-json-stre...6V%3D4%26LU...`
*   **JSON Response (from the selected request):**
    ```json
    {"acc":1,"webResult":{}}
    ```

**6. Interpretation and Potential Data Science Relevance:**

*   The requests are likely API calls fetching data, given the `Fetch/XHR` filter, `application/x-json-stream` content type, and the JSON response.
*   The response `{"acc":1,"webResult":{}}` is crucial.
    *   `"acc":1`: This often indicates "success" or "account" (e.g., a successful authentication or operation).
    *   `"webResult":{}`: This is an **empty JSON object**. This is a common scenario in data science or web development debugging where an API call succeeds (e.g., status code 200 OK), but the actual data payload is empty.
*   **Potential Problem/Debugging Point:** If the user was expecting specific data from this request (e.g., results from a query, a dataset, or a computed output), the empty `webResult` suggests that:
    *   No data matched the query/parameters sent.
    *   There's an issue on the backend returning an empty result set instead of the expected data.
    *   The parameters sent in the request (the `6V%3D4%26LU` part, which is URL-encoded) might be incorrect or missing.
    *   The frontend application logic might not be correctly handling or displaying the `webResult` even if data *was* expected.

In summary, the screenshot shows a user investigating API calls that appear to succeed but return an empty data payload, which is a common troubleshooting scenario in data-driven web applications.*

> rm me where I did mistake

Sorry but im facing an issue with question 6 and 7 where its saying load failed when I submit it. when I run the queries locally using curl im getting the expected results. Any help would be appreciated.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

This screenshot displays an interactive prompt within a web-based learning environment, likely designed to validate a student's locally running API implementation.

**Key Information:**

1.  **CORS Requirement:** The primary instruction at the top emphasizes the need to enable **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** on the user's API. This is critical for web applications (like the one displaying this interface) to make requests to a server running on a different "origin" (e.g., a different domain, port, or protocol). If CORS is not correctly configured on the API server, the browser will block the request, leading to common errors.

2.  **API URL Endpoint Prompt:** The user is asked to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation.
    *   An example is provided: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`
    *   This example suggests a local development setup (using the loopback IP address `127.0.0.1` and a common development port like `8000`), with an endpoint path of `/execute`.

3.  **User Input for API Endpoint:**
    *   The user has entered: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute`
    *   This URL is highlighted with a red border and an exclamation mark icon, indicating an issue or an error associated with this input. The port `8001` is different from the example's `8000`, which is typically fine as long as the user's server is configured to run on `8001`.

4.  **Error Message:** Immediately below the input field, a crucial error message is displayed.
    *   **Exact Transcription:** `TypeError: Load failed`
    *   **Analysis:** In the context of browser-initiated network requests, `TypeError: Load failed` is a very common and generic error. It often means the browser tried to make a request but it was blocked or failed before a proper HTTP response (like a 200 OK, 404 Not Found, or 500 Internal Server Error) could be received. The most probable causes, especially given the explicit CORS instruction above, are:
        *   **CORS Policy Blocking:** The browser's security policy is preventing the request from completing because the server (on `127.0.0.1:8001`) is not sending the necessary CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to permit requests from the origin where this web page is hosted.
        *   **Server Unreachable:** The API server might not be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`, or a firewall/network issue is preventing the connection.

5.  **API Test Method Description:**
    *   The system explains how it will test the provided URL: "We'll check by sending a GET request to this URL with `?q=...` containing a task."
    *   This indicates the API is expected to respond to `GET` requests and should accept a query parameter named `q` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute?q=your_task`).
    *   It also states: "We'll verify that it matches the expected response. Arguments must be in the same order as the function definition." This implies a specific response format and potentially strict parameter handling are required for successful validation.

6.  **Action Button:** A "Check" button is present, which the user would click to initiate the API validation process.

**In summary, the user is trying to connect a web-based learning environment to their local API. The `TypeError: Load failed` strongly suggests that the connection is being blocked, most likely due to a misconfigured or missing CORS policy on the user's API server, or simply that the API server isn't running or isn't accessible at the specified address and port.***



```
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute?q=What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742?"

{"name":"get_ticket_status","arguments":"{\"ticket_id\": 83742}"}

```

For question 2, do we have to make the API call to the proxy or openai? If to the proxy, are there any instructions on the page *before* question 2 that would have pointed me in that direction?

### Post #106 by **Yogaswetha** (ds-students)
*February 05, 2025, 14:04 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum or assignment, likely focusing on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom tools or APIs. The user is attempting to configure and test an API endpoint.

Here's the key information:

**1. Function Definition (Left Panel, Top):**
The assignment defines a function that the LLM is expected to use or call.
*   **Name:** `get_ticket_status`
*   **Arguments:** `ticket_id` (example value 83742). The arguments are provided as a stringified JSON object.

**Code/JSON Transcription:**
```json
{
  "name": "get_ticket_status",
  "arguments": "{\"ticket_id\": 83742}"
}
```

**2. API Endpoint Configuration (Left Panel, Middle):**
The user is prompted to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation.
*   **Instruction:** "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   **User Input:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`
*   **Error Message:** `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON`
    *   This error appears below the API URL input field. It suggests that the validation system is expecting a JSON response or a valid JSON structure from something related to the URL, but received "undefined" when it tried to parse it.

**3. API Check Mechanism (Left Panel, Below Error):**
The system explains how it will test the provided API endpoint.
*   **Method:** Sending a GET request.
*   **Query Parameter:** It will use `?q=...` to send a task/query to the API.
*   **Validation:** It will verify that the API's response matches the expected structure, specifically that "Arguments must be in the same order as the function definition."
*   **Button:** "Check"

**4. API Testing Tool (Right Panel - likely Swagger UI or similar):**
This panel simulates how the API would be called.
*   **Input Parameter (`q`):**
    *   **Name:** `q` (required, string, query type)
    *   **Value:** `What is the status of ticket 83742?`
*   **Action Button:** "Execute"
*   **Generated cURL Command:** This command shows how to make the API call from the command line.

**cURL Command Transcription:**
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
'http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742%3F' \
-H 'accept: application/json'
```
*   **Request URL:** This is the URL that would be sent.

**Request URL Transcription:**
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742%3F`

*   **Server Response:** The "Server response" area is visible but empty, suggesting the "Execute" button might not have been clicked, or no response has been received/displayed yet in this specific view.

**5. Assignment Context (Left Panel, Bottom):**
*   **Task 9:** "Get an LLM to say Yes (1 mark)" - This indicates the broader context of the assignment involves interacting with and getting specific responses from an LLM.

**Summary of the Problem:**
The primary issue highlighted is the `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON` when the user enters the API endpoint. This error seems to stem from a validation step within the course environment that attempts to parse something as JSON, but fails because it receives an "undefined" value, possibly when trying to make an initial connection or validate the endpoint itself. The user has correctly identified the expected endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` and the system is ready to test it with a natural language query transformed into a `q` parameter.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online examination or assignment interface for a data science course, likely from IIT Madras, specifically "TDS 2025 Jan GA3". The user has a remaining time of 04:15:56 and a current score of 8.5 out of 9.5.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course/Platform Context:** The webpage is part of an exam or assignment system hosted at `exam.sanand.workers.dev`. Browser tabs indicate it's associated with "My Dashboard - IIT Madras", "Course Introduction :: IITM", and "Tools in Data Science", with the specific course being "TDS 2025 Jan GA3".
2.  **Task Description - "Service Flow":** The core of the task is to implement an API for document similarity search, detailed in four steps:
    *   **Request Payload:** The API should accept a POST request with a JSON body containing two keys:
        *   `docs`: An array of document texts (from an internal knowledge base).
        *   `query`: A string representing the user's search query.
    *   **Embedding Generation:** For both the `docs` array and the `query` string, the API must compute text embeddings using the `text-embedding-3-small` model.
    *   **Similarity Computation:** The API then calculates the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document embedding to find the best matches.
    *   **Response Structure:** After ranking documents by similarity, the API should return the identifiers (or positions) of the three most similar documents in a JSON format.
3.  **CORS Requirement:** The implementation must enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow `OPTIONS` and `POST` methods, potentially from all origins and headers.
4.  **Question & Answer:** The question asks for the API URL endpoint for the implementation.
    *   The suggested format is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
    *   The provided answer `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` is marked "Correct".
5.  **Validation Method:** The system will check the implementation by sending a POST request to the specified URL with a JSON body containing random `docs` and `query`.

### Post #110 by **Khushi Dhankhar** (ds-students)
*February 05, 2025, 14:39 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive coding problem from an online data science course, likely an exam or graded assignment related to Large Language Models (LLMs).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Course/Platform Context:**
*   **Course:** IIT Madras, Tools in Data Science (TDS), January 2025 cohort.
*   **Assignment:** Graded Assignment 3 (GA3) on Large Language Models.
*   **Environment:** An online exam/coding platform (`exam.sanand.workers.dev`).
*   **Current Status:** Timer shows "03:52:24 left". Score is "8.5 / 9.5", indicating most of the problem is solved, but there's an issue preventing a perfect score.

**Problem Objective & Instructions:**
The problem requires the student to construct a prompt for an LLM to perform sentiment analysis.
1.  **Authorization:** Pass an `Authorization` header with a dummy API key.
2.  **Model:** Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the LLM model.
3.  **System Message:** The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze sentiment, specifying "GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL" as categories.
4.  **User Message:** The second message must be *exactly* a specific string of text for sentiment analysis.
*   **API Library Constraint:** The problem uses a dummy `httpx` library. Only specific functions are allowed for interaction:
    *   `httpx.get(url, **kwargs)`
    *   `httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)`
    *   `response.raise_for_status()`
    *   `response.json()`

**Provided Code (Input/Attempt):**
The student has provided a Python dictionary named `DATA`, which typically represents the JSON payload sent to an LLM API.

```python
DATA = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Analyze the sentiment of the following text as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk,"}
    ]
}
```

**Error Message:**
An error message is displayed below the code block, indicating a problem with the user message.

```
Error: The user message must be N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk, not N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk,
```

**Analysis of the Error:**
The error message is contradictory. It states that "The user message must be N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk," and then immediately says "not N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk,". This is a common pattern in coding challenges where a string comparison fails due to subtle differences not visible to the naked eye (e.g., leading/trailing whitespace, non-breaking spaces, or other hidden characters). The student's code contains the exact string as shown in the first part of the error, suggesting an invisible character mismatch is the problem.*



  
in the 1st as well both the outouts are exactly same but its still showing error

You can run 2 different severs on different port numbers.  
<http://127.0.0.1:8000> and <http://127.0.0.1:8001>

I tried checking the JSON Output in the Networks tab. I am getting error as “Method Not Found”. But, I have allowed POST Method for question 7 as POST method is used in the question. I also tried checking my API by sending a POST request by the same parameters as given by the Website. I am getting the proper response when I give an API request. Can you please help me out here? I have attached the screenshot of the error as Picture -1 and the correct output what I get as Picture-2. Please help me out as I am facing issue for all the API Questions though I am getting the right output. Thank You.  


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Type of Output:** The screenshot displays a text string formatted as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object. This is a common format for API responses, particularly for error messages or data payloads.
2.  **Message Content:** It contains a single key-value pair.
    *   **Key:** `"detail"`
    *   **Value:** `"Method Not Allowed"`
3.  **Context (Inferred):** This message is a standard HTTP error response, specifically corresponding to an HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" status code. In the context of a data science course, this typically means:
    *   **API Interaction:** The user has attempted to access an API endpoint using an HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that is not supported or allowed for that particular resource. For instance, they might have sent a POST request to an endpoint that only accepts GET requests, or vice versa.
    *   **Web Application Development:** If the course involves building web applications (e.g., using Flask, Django, FastAPI for model deployment or data dashboards), this error indicates that a view function or route handler does not allow the HTTP method used by the client.
    *   **Permissions:** Less commonly, it could relate to specific method-level permissions where a user is not authorized to perform a certain type of operation (e.g., a "write" operation via POST/PUT) on a resource.
4.  **Troubleshooting Implication:** To resolve this issue, the user would typically need to consult the API documentation or the server's routing configuration to determine which HTTP methods are permitted for the specific endpoint they are trying to access.

**Transcribed Code/Error Message:**

```
{"detail":"Method Not Allowed"}
```*

  


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a section of text, most likely from a data science forum, presented in a structured format resembling a Python dictionary or JSON object. The text appears to be part of a larger output, possibly a result of text processing or information extraction, given the key `'matches'`.

**Key Information:**

The content consists of a list of strings under the key `'matches'`. These strings are concise, news-like statements or updates, suggesting a business or project management context.

1.  **Product Update:** The first statement details a "product update" that addresses "reported bugs" and introduces "several enhancements." This indicates a focus on software development or product lifecycle management.
2.  **IT Expansion Approval:** The second statement reports that "The leadership team has approved the expansion of our global IT support network." This highlights organizational growth and infrastructure development.
3.  **Incomplete Statement:** The third statement begins with "The internal r" but is cut off, preventing a full understanding of its content.

The overall context suggests that this data could be derived from internal communications, project logs, or summarized reports, which a data scientist might analyze for trends, sentiment, or key information extraction.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
{'matches': ["The product update addresses reported bugs and introduces several enhancements.", "The leadership team has approved the expansion of our global IT support network.", "The internal r
```
*(Note: The third string in the list is cut off and incomplete in the provided image.)**

> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information

1.  **Context:** The user is attempting to write Python code, likely within a web-based interactive environment or a custom platform (given the nature of the `TypeError`). The problem involves Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically calculating similarities between "embeddings" (numerical representations of words/phrases).
2.  **User's Goal (Inferred):** The code aims to define a function (likely `most_similar`) that calculates dot products between embeddings and then finds the maximum dot product. This is a common step in finding the most similar items (e.g., words, sentences) based on their vector representations.
3.  **Core Logic:** The code snippet shows nested loops (`for j in words:` inside `for i in words:`) iterating through some `words` collection. Inside these loops, `np.dot` (indicating `numpy` is used for vector operations) is applied to `embeddings[i]` and `embeddings[j]`, and the result is appended to `dot_product_df`. The function then `return max(dot_product_df)`.
4.  **Input/Usage:** The `print` statement shows a call to `most_similar` with a dictionary as an argument: `{"I experienced issues during checkout.": [list_of_float_numbers]}`. This implies the function `most_similar` should take an embedding (the list of floats) as input. This contradicts the internal `for i in words:` and `for j in words:` loops if `words` is not being passed into the function or derived from the input.
5.  **Python Code Issues (Highlighted by red squiggles/inferred):**
    *   **`dot_product_df` not defined:** The variable `dot_product_df` is used with the `.append()` method without being initialized first (e.g., `dot_product_df = []`). This would lead to a `NameError` if the code reached this point.
    *   **Function Signature Missing:** The `def` line for `most_similar` is cut off, but the `return` statement indicates it's inside a function. The interaction between the `print` call's argument and the internal loops suggests a potential mismatch in expected arguments or internal logic.
    *   **Syntax Error in `print` call:** The closing `}` for the dictionary and the final `)` for the `print` function are missing after the long list of numbers. This would cause a `SyntaxError`.
6.  **Error Message Nature:** The `TypeError: Z.runPython(...).toJs is not a function` is *not* a standard Python error traceback. This strongly suggests an issue within the execution environment itself (e.g., a web-based Jupyter-like notebook, a custom IDE, or a platform that bridges Python execution with a JavaScript frontend). It indicates that the platform failed to convert the Python output (or perhaps an intermediate state) into a JavaScript object, possibly masking the underlying Python errors.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages

**Python Code:**

```python
for i in words:
for j in words:
    dot_product_df.append(np.dot(embeddings[i], embeddings[j]))
return max(dot_product_df)

print(most_similar({"I experienced issues during checkout.":
[-0.10228022187948227, -0.057035524398088455, -0.083200617432594299, -0.1569785177707672, -0.11162916576901871, -0.017878107726573944, -0.06209372356534004, 0.18209508061408997, -0.0027645661029964685, 0.12928052246570587, 0.176095008885009766, -0.11846645176410675, -0.2356770783662796
```

*(Note: The first line of the function definition, likely `def most_similar(...)`, is cut off. The `for i in words:` line is the first visible line of the function body. The closing `}` and `)` for the `print` statement are also missing from the screenshot.)*

**Error Message:**

```
TypeError: Z.runPython(...).toJs is not a function
```*

### Post #116 by **Jayesh Bansal** (ds-students)
*February 05, 2025, 16:32 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course or assignment interface, where a user is being prompted to provide the API endpoint for their local implementation.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the key information:

**1. Prompt/Question:**
*   **Question:** "What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation?"
*   **Example Given:** "It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`"
    *   This suggests the user needs to run a local server (on `127.0.0.1`, port `8000`) with an endpoint `/execute`.

**2. User Input Field:**
*   **Entered Value:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=`
    *   The user has entered a URL that includes the `?q=` query parameter, which is typically used to pass data via a GET request.
*   **Validation Indicator:** A red border around the input field and a red exclamation mark icon (`!`) indicating an error or invalid input.

**3. Error Message:**
*   **Exact Transcription:** `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
*   **Interpretation:** This is a client-side network error, commonly encountered in web browsers (e.g., JavaScript's `fetch` API). It means the browser was unable to successfully initiate or complete a request to the specified URL. Common reasons for this error include:
    *   The server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` is not running or not accessible.
    *   A firewall is blocking the connection.
    *   Incorrect IP address or port.
    *   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy preventing the request if the validation script is running from a different origin than `127.0.0.1`.

**4. System Testing Instructions:**
*   **Methodology:** "We'll check by sending a GET request to this URL with `?q=...` containing a task."
    *   This clarifies that the system expects the *base* endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`) and will then append the `?q=` parameter *itself* with an actual task for testing. The user including `?q=` in their submitted URL might be redundant or even problematic if the system appends another `?q=` afterwards (resulting in `?q=?q=...`, which is invalid syntax), though the `TypeError: Failed to fetch` suggests a more fundamental connectivity issue before parameter parsing.
*   **Validation Criterion:** "We'll verify that it matches the expected response."
*   **Important Hint for User's Code:** "Arguments must be in the same order as the function definition."
    *   This is a crucial hint for the user's backend API implementation, indicating that the order of parameters (if there were multiple, e.g., `?q=...&param2=...`) matters for the server-side function that processes the GET request.

**Summary of the Problem:**
The user has provided an API endpoint, but the validation system cannot connect to it, resulting in a `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. The most likely cause is that the local server (expected to be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) is either not running, or there's a network/firewall issue preventing the validation script from reaching it. The `?q=` in the user's input might be slightly off the expected format for the base URL, but the primary issue is connectivity.*

### Post #117 by **Arnav Raj ** (ds-students)
*February 05, 2025, 16:34 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a data science student's attempt at an online programming assignment involving an API, showing both the assignment interface and their development environment.

### Key Information:

**1. Left Pane (Online Course/Assignment Interface):**

*   **Course Context:** The URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3` indicates an online exam or assignment, likely for a "TDS" (The Data Science/Tech Data Science) course in January 2025.
*   **Time & Score:** `02:10:25 left` shows remaining time, and `Score: 7 / 9.5` indicates the student's current progress.
*   **Assignment Objective/Expected Output:** The problem asks the student to implement an API for "similarity" matching. The text specifies the *expected* ranking for a sample query:
    > Here, "Contents of document 3" is considered the closest match, followed by "Contents of document 1", then "Contents of document 2".
*   **Technical Hint:** The course advises enabling CORS:
    > Make sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers.
*   **API Endpoint Question:** The student is asked to provide their API URL endpoint. The expected format is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
    *   **Student's Input:** The student has correctly entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
*   **Error Message from Assignment Grader:** Despite the correct URL and a successful API call from the student's side (as seen in the right pane), the assignment grader reports an error, indicating the *logic* is incorrect.
    *   **Exact Error Message:**
        ```
        Error: Got incorrect matches: The project blueprint for migrating to microservices architecture is complete, Our system maintenance has been updated to minimize downtime, The IT support portal now features a self-service FAQ for common issues.
        ```
        *(Note: The long, generic text after "incorrect matches" seems like placeholder or default error filler from the grading system, the key part being "Got incorrect matches".)*
*   **Grading Mechanism:** The assignment states how it will test the API:
    > We'll check by sending a POST request to this URL with a JSON body containing random `docs` and `query`.
*   **Current Section:** The assignment is on "8 Function Calling (1.5 marks)".

**2. Right Pane (VS Code Development Environment):**

*   **API Client:** The user is utilizing "Thunder Client," a VS Code extension for testing APIs.
*   **API Request Sent (Thunder Client - Body Tab):**
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`
    *   **Request Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "docs": ["Contents of document 1", "Contents of document 2", "Contents of document 3"],
          "query": "Your query string"
        }
        ```
*   **API Response Received (Thunder Client - Response Tab):**
    *   **Status:** `200 OK` (HTTP success)
    *   **Size:** `88 Bytes`
    *   **Time:** `8 ms`
    *   **Response Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "matches": [
            "Contents of document 1",
            "Contents of document 2",
            "Contents of document 3"
          ]
        }
        ```
        *(This response indicates that the API is returning the documents in their original order, not sorted by similarity as expected by the assignment.)*

*   **Terminal (VS Code - Running the API Server):**
    *   **Command Executed to Start Server:**
        ```bash
        $ python -m uvicorn q7_test:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
        ```
        *(This command starts a Uvicorn server, likely serving a FastAPI application defined in `q7_test.py` as `app`, on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with hot-reloading enabled.)*
    *   **Server Logs:**
        ```
        INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: ['D:\\Professional\\IITM\\TDS\\Week_3']
        INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        INFO: Started reloader process [9060] using StatReload
        INFO: Started server process [15880]
        INFO: Waiting for application startup.
        INFO: Application startup complete.
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:64190 - "POST /similarity HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:64196 - "POST /similarity HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        ```
        *(These logs confirm the Uvicorn server is running correctly and successfully processed two POST requests to the `/similarity` endpoint, returning 200 OK.)*

### Problem Diagnosis:

The core issue is that the student's API, while running and responding successfully with a `200 OK` status, is not producing the *correct logical output* as required by the assignment.

*   **Expected Output (from assignment):** Documents ranked by similarity (e.g., Doc 3, then Doc 1, then Doc 2).
*   **Actual Output (from student's API):** Documents returned in the same order they were provided in the input list (`"Contents of document 1"`, `"Contents of document 2"`, `"Contents of document 3"`).

This discrepancy in the `matches` list is why the assignment grader reports "Error: Got incorrect matches", even though the HTTP request itself was technically successful. The student needs to revise their `q7_test.py` application logic to correctly implement the similarity ranking.*

Hi,

I’m sorry if I’m asking an unrelated question, But I’m very confused with the concept of generating the token from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

Could any one suggest the step by step process? I couldn’t able to find that similar question asked by anyone since the conversations are vast.

Please guide me on this. Also do i need to use my personal mail id or iitm mail id for accessing this token

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user interface element from what appears to be a data science course or application, where a user is prompted to provide an API URL endpoint. The interface displays an input field, a prompt, and an error message.

**Key Information:**

*   **Prompt/Question:** The user is being asked: "What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation?"
*   **Example URL Provided:** The prompt includes an example of what the URL "might look like": `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` (displayed in a reddish-pink color).
*   **User Input:** The user has entered an API URL into the input field.
*   **Input Field State:** The input field is highlighted with a red border, and a red exclamation mark `(!) ` icon is visible on the right side, indicating an error or invalid entry.
*   **Error Message:** Below the input field, a `SyntaxError` is displayed.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Example URL in Prompt:**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute
    ```
*   **User-entered API URL:**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute
    ```
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON
    ```

**Analysis:**

The user has attempted to provide the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute`.
A critical observation is the difference between the example URL provided in the prompt (`:8000`) and the user's input (`:9000`). This discrepancy in the port number (`8000` vs. `9000`) is highly likely to be the root cause of the issue.

The error `SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON` suggests the following:
1.  A network request was made to `http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute`.
2.  The response received from that endpoint was not in a valid JSON format.
3.  The client-side code (likely JavaScript) then attempted to parse this non-JSON response as JSON, leading to the `SyntaxError`. The `"[object Object]"` part often appears when JavaScript tries to implicitly convert a non-string object (e.g., an HTML error page, a simple text response, or even a network error object) into a string when expecting valid JSON.

It's probable that the server for the user's implementation is actually listening on port `8000` (as indicated by the example), and sending a request to `9000` either results in a connection refused/timeout, or hits a different process that returns a non-JSON response (e.g., a web server's default "not found" page or an empty response). The system then tries to parse this unexpected response as JSON, resulting in the displayed error.*

The error shows your code is getting wrong answers for the test cases. I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to <http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings> with required headers. And, then calculate `similarity_scores` simply using  
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}  
which in python syntax is-

```
np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

```

Sir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You  


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an error message, likely an API response or a system output from a data science environment.

Here's the key information:

*   **Type of Information:** An error message structured as a dictionary (or JSON object).
*   **Top-Level Key:** The primary key is `'error'`, indicating the overall content is related to an error.
*   **Nested Structure:** Within the `'error'` dictionary, there's another key-value pair.
*   **Specific Error Message Key:** The nested key is `'message'`.
*   **Error Description:** The value associated with `'message'` clearly states the problem: the user has exceeded a resource limit.
*   **Nature of the Error:** This is a "quota" error, meaning the user has used up their allowed amount of a particular resource (e.g., API calls, computation time, storage, data transfer) within a given timeframe, or on their current service plan.
*   **Suggested Resolution:** The message advises the user to "check your plan and billing details." This implies the solution involves reviewing their subscription, usage limits, or potentially upgrading their service tier.

**Transcribed Error Message (exactly as it appears):**

```
{'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.'}}
```*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interface from what appears to be an online learning platform for a data science course, likely an assignment or coding exercise environment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Activity Status and Controls (Top Red Bar):**
*   **Deadline/End Date:** "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" - This indicates the activity had a specific deadline. The "Ended at" suggests it's either in the past or the final deadline has been reached.
*   **Current Score:** "Score: 0" - This is the current score for the user on this activity.
*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   "Check all" - Likely used to submit or check all answers/code for correctness.
    *   "Save" - Allows the user to save their current progress.

**2. Discussion Forum Integration (Blue Banner):**
*   **Support/Community Link:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" - This provides a direct link to the course's discussion forum, powered by Discourse, for seeking help or engaging with peers/instructors.

**3. User Information:**
*   **Logged-in User:** "You are logged in as 24f2005437@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." - This identifies the user by a unique student ID/enrollment number, indicating an affiliation with "ds.study.iitm.ac.in," which strongly suggests a Data Science program from IIT Madras.
*   **Logout Option:** "Logout" - A standard button to log out of the session.

**4. Recent Saves History (Green Section):**
*   **Header:** "Recent saves" - This section lists previous points in time when the user saved their work.
*   **Save Entry 1:** "Loaded from 5/2/2025, 11:20:33 pm. Score: 6" - Indicates that a save from this specific date and time was previously loaded, and at that point, the activity had a score of 6.
*   **Save Entry 2:** "Reload from 5/2/2025, 11:20:20 pm. Score: 6" - Another save point from a slightly earlier time on the same date, also showing a score of 6. The "Reload" option suggests the ability to revert to this specific saved state.

**Key Observations/Inferences:**
*   The discrepancy between the current "Score: 0" at the top and the "Score: 6" in the "Recent saves" section suggests that the user might have loaded an older version of their work, or their current unsaved changes have resulted in a lower score (or they haven't run a "Check all" yet for the current state).
*   The platform is interactive, allowing users to save progress and check their work.
*   The presence of a Discourse link highlights an active community or support system for the course.
*   The "2025" date implies this screenshot might be from a future academic term, a demo, or simply a placeholder for a course that is yet to begin or is ongoing for an extended period.*

I have submitted ga3 still showing not submitted , why sir?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web page for a graded assignment, "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language Models," from what appears to be an online data science course, likely IIT Madras's online degree program (`ds.study.iitm.ac.in`).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Key Information:

*   **Course/Module:** Module 3: Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Assignment Name:** Graded Assignment 3 (GA3).
*   **Student Status:**
    *   Logged in as `23f1001348@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
    *   Submission status: "Not Submitted".
*   **Deadline:**
    *   The assignment is "Due: 5 Feb 2025".
    *   A banner at the top states: "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This presents a slight ambiguity: if it "ended at" the due date, it implies the deadline is strict and might have passed for this particular attempt, or the banner is a general indicator of the deadline. However, the "Not Submitted" status combined with the future date implies the student might still have time to work on it before the final deadline.
*   **Current Score/Progress:**
    *   The current displayed score is "Score: 0".
    *   However, under "Recent saves," there's a record: "Reload from 2/4/2025, 4:04:47 PM. Score: 9.5". This indicates the student has previously worked on the assignment and achieved a score of 9.5 on an earlier save. The "Reload" button allows them to resume from this state.
*   **Assignment Mechanics:**
    *   **Open-Book/Resource:** Extremely liberal. Students are explicitly allowed to "Use anything. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."
    *   **Submission/Saving:** "Your last saved submission will be evaluated." Students are advised to "Save regularly" by pressing the "Save" button. There is no explicit "Submit" button, implying the last saved state is considered the submission.
    *   **Checking Answers:** Students can "Check answers regularly" by pressing the "Check" button to see right/wrong answers multiple times.
    *   **Technical Aspects:**
        *   "Answers are saved in your browser (not server)" – this is an interesting and potentially risky instruction, as clearing browser data would erase progress unless a "Save" action pushes it to the server. (The existence of "Recent saves" with a date and score suggests server-side persistence via the "Save" button).
        *   Questions may have "randomized parameters."
        *   "Browser may struggle" is anticipated, suggesting complex interactive elements.
        *   **"It's hackable. ... That's allowed."** This is a highly unusual and significant instruction, indicating that understanding the underlying code/system of the quiz and exploiting it for answers is permissible. This hints at a focus on practical problem-solving and potentially security concepts within the data science context.
        *   "You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers." This confirms a hands-on, practical component involving managing or interacting with server environments.
*   **Support:** A link to "Join the discussion on Discourse" is provided for questions.
*   **Scoring Metrics (currently empty):** Your Score, Peer Average, Median Score.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There is no explicit code or error message displayed, but here are the key commands and instructions:

please reply why its showing not submitted in ga3 but i have submitted that  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, presented as an expert would for a data science course forum:

This screenshot displays the main page for a graded assignment from an online data science course, likely from IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) based on the email domain and linked resources.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course & Assignment Identification:**
    *   **Course:** TDS (likely "Topics in Data Science" or similar) for January 2025.
    *   **Module:** Module 3: Large Language Models.
    *   **Assignment:** Graded Assignment 3 (GA3).

2.  **Deadline & Status:**
    *   **Deadline:** The assignment "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 PM IST". This is a critical piece of information indicating the submission cutoff.
    *   **Current Status:** "Not Submitted" is explicitly stated under "Graded Assignment 3".
    *   **Current Score Display (Top):** "Score: 0"
    *   **Recent Save Information:** A save was made on "2/4/2025, 4:04:47 PM" with a "Score: 9.5". This suggests the user has made progress and saved their work, but the assignment has not been formally submitted. The instructions indicate "Your last saved submission will be evaluated," implying that the 9.5 score might be the one considered if no further action is taken before the deadline.

3.  **User Information:**
    *   **Logged in as:** `23f1001348@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`

4.  **Assignment Instructions (Crucial for User Guidance):**
    *   The instructions clearly outline the rules and expectations for the graded assignment.
    *   **Learning & Resources:**
        *   Participants can learn what they need; reading material is provided but not mandatory if the question can be answered.
        *   **"Use anything."**: Participants are explicitly allowed to use any resources, including "The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever," and "any libraries or frameworks you want." This indicates an open-book, collaborative, and tool-agnostic environment.
    *   **Checking & Saving:**
        *   **"Check answers regularly"**: Users can press `Check` multiple times to see right/wrong answers.
        *   **"Save regularly"**: Users can press `Save` multiple times. The "last saved submission will be evaluated."
        *   **"Reloading is OK."**: Answers are saved in the browser (not server), and questions won't change except for randomized parameters.
    *   **Technical Notes:**
        *   **"Browser may struggle."**: Advice to turn off security restrictions or try a different browser if loading issues occur.
        *   **"It's hackable."**: Explicitly states it's possible to get answers by "hacking the code for this quiz" and that this is "allowed." This is highly unusual and suggests a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms.
        *   **"Note: You'll run multiple servers in this exam. *All of them* must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers."**: This is a critical technical requirement, implying a need for specific setup or environment management during the exam.

5.  **Support and Navigation:**
    *   **Discourse Forum:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" provides a link to a community forum for support.
    *   **Navigation Bar:** Other course-related tabs are open, including "MLF Quiz-1 PYQ" and "Graded Assignment 3 = IITM O...", suggesting other coursework.

6.  **Score Breakdown (Currently Empty):**
    *   Sections for "Your Score", "Peer Average", and "Median Score" are present but currently display "-", likely because the assignment is not yet formally submitted or graded for final display in this section.

*   **Project Name:** `GA3_Q8` (visible in the top bar and Explorer).
*   **Active File:** `main.py` is open and active in the editor pane, specifically located at `app/main.py`. Another file, `.env`, is open but not currently focused.
*   **File Explorer:** Shows the project structure, including:
    *   `app/` directory with `__pycache__`, `__init__.py`, `main.py`.
    *   `venv/` (a Python virtual environment).
    *   Configuration files: `.env`, `requirements.txt`.
*   **Language & Version:** Python 3.13.1 is in use, running within a virtual environment named `venv` (as indicated in the bottom status bar: `Python 3.13.1 ('venv': venv)`).
*   **Cursor Position:** The cursor is on Line 58, Column 6 (`Ln 58, Col 6`).
*   **Indentation/Encoding:** Spaces: 4, UTF-8 encoding, LF line endings.

**2. Python Code (`main.py`):**
The code appears to be part of a natural language processing or chatbot system, using regular expressions (`re` module) to parse user queries.

*   **Function Definition:**
    ```python
    def parse_query(query: str):
    ```
    This function takes a string `query` as input.

*   **Ticket Status Parsing (Lines 53-54):**
    The line `return "get_ticket_status", {"ticket_id": int(match_ticket_status.group(1))}` suggests an earlier `re.match` operation for `get_ticket_status` that captured a `ticket_id`.

*   **Schedule Meeting Parsing (Lines 56-67):**
    This section attempts to match queries like "Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1".
    ```python
    # Match "Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1"
    match_schedule_meeting = re.match(
        r"(?i)(arrange\s*meeting|schedule\s*a\s*meeting)\s*(?:on\s*)?(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\s*(\d{2}:\d{2})(?:,\s*room:\s*(.*))?",
        query
    )
    if match_schedule_meeting:
        print(f"Schedule Meeting Match: {match_schedule_meeting.groups()}") # Debug lo
        return "schedule_meeting", {
            "date": match_schedule_meeting.group(2),
            "time": match_schedule_meeting.group(3),
            "meeting_room": match_schedule_meeting.group(4).strip(),
        }
    ```
    *   **Regex Breakdown:**
        *   `(?i)`: Case-insensitive flag.
        *   `(arrange\s*meeting|schedule\s*a\s*meeting)`: Matches "arrange meeting" or "schedule a meeting". This is `group(1)`.
        *   `\s*(?:on\s*)?`: Optional "on " phrase.
        *   `(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})`: Captures the date (e.g., "2025-12-17"). This is `group(2)`.
        *   `\s*(\d{2}:\d{2})`: Captures the time (e.g., "06:09"). This is `group(3)`.
        *   `(?:,\s*room:\s*(.*))?`: Optional group for "room: " followed by any characters, capturing the room name. This makes the entire room part optional, and the room name itself is `group(4)`.

*   **Expense Balance Parsing (Lines 69-72):**
    This section is for matching queries related to expense balances. The regex is partially visible.
    ```python
    # Match "Show my expense balance for employee <employee_id>"
    match_expense_balance = re.match(r"(?i)show\s*my\s*expense\s*balance\s*for\s*employ",
    if match_expense_balance:
        print(f"Expense Balance Match: {match_expense_balance.groups()}") # Debug log
    ```

**3. Terminal Output:**
The `TERMINAL` tab is active, showing the `zsh` shell. The output indicates HTTP requests and parsing attempts.

*   **Error Messages and Info Logs:**
    ```
    Query format did not match any predefined patterns.
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:60464 - "GET /execute?q=Arrange+meeting+2025-12-17%2C+06%3A09%2C+room%3A+Conf1 HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:60464 - "POST /similarity HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
    Parsing query: Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1
    Query format did not match any predefined patterns.
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:60464 - "GET /execute?q=Arrange+meeting+2025-12-17%2C+06%3A09%2C+room%3A+Conf1 HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request
    ```

**Key Information & Problem Analysis:**

*   **Core Issue:** The primary problem appears to be that the `parse_query` function is failing to match the "Arrange meeting" query using the defined regular expression, despite the query string `Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1` appearing to fit the pattern's intent.
*   **Error Flow:**
    1.  A `GET` request is made to `/execute` with a URL-encoded query: `q=Arrange+meeting+2025-12-17%2C+06%3A09%2C+room%3A+Conf1`.
    2.  The application processes this, leading to the debug message "Parsing query: Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1".
    3.  Crucially, the `re.match` call for `match_schedule_meeting` fails, causing `if match_schedule_meeting:` to evaluate to false.
    4.  This leads to the generic error output: "Query format did not match any predefined patterns."
    5.  Subsequently, the server returns a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code for this specific GET request.
*   **Secondary Issue:** There's also a `POST /similarity` request that resulted in a `404 Not Found`, indicating an issue with another API endpoint or service related to "similarity."
*   **Debugging Point:** The user needs to debug why the `match_schedule_meeting` regex (`r"(?i)(arrange\s*meeting|schedule\s*a\s*meeting)\s*(?:on\s*)?(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\s*(\d{2}:\d{2})(?:,\s*room:\s*(.*))?"`) is not successfully matching the input `Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1`. A common pitfall is the `re.match` function matching only at the *beginning* of the string. If there are any leading characters not accounted for, or if the pattern itself has a subtle mismatch, it will fail.
    *   Looking closely at the query: `Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1`.
    *   The regex: `r"(?i)(arrange\s*meeting|schedule\s*a\s*meeting)\s*(?:on\s*)?(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\s*(\d{2}:\d{2})(?:,\s*room:\s*(.*))?"`
    *   The pattern seems designed to match this, including the comma before "room:". The issue might be extremely subtle, e.g., an unexpected whitespace, a different comma type, or perhaps the regex needs `re.search` instead of `re.match` if the string isn't guaranteed to start with the pattern. However, given the `parse_query` context, `re.match` is typically appropriate.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a student's attempt at a programming assignment within an online data science course, specifically focusing on "function calling" functionality, likely in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) or AI agents. The student is facing an API integration issue.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Course/Assignment Context:**
*   **Course Name (in URL):** `tds-2025-01-ga3#hq-function-calling` - Suggests this is a "Generative AI" or "Large Language Model" course, with a module on "Function Calling."
*   **Due Date:** Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST
*   **Current Score:** 6.5 / 9.5
*   **Task Goal:** The student is implementing an API endpoint that can receive and process function calls.

**2. Defined Function Call Structure (JSON):**
The assignment provides a required structure for the function call that the student's API should handle.
*   **Code/JSON to Transcribe:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "get_ticket_status",
      "arguments": "{ \"ticket_id\": 83742}"
    }
    ```
    *   **Analysis of `arguments`:** The value for `"arguments"` is a *string* containing a JSON object, where the inner double quotes are escaped (`\"`). This implies that the entire `"{ \"ticket_id\": 83742}"` string needs to be passed as an argument.

**3. API Implementation Requirements/Hints:**
*   **CORS:** "Make sure you enable **CORS** to allow GET requests from any origin." - This is a crucial server-side configuration requirement for the API endpoint.
*   **API URL Endpoint:** The student needs to provide the URL for their API implementation.
    *   **Example URL provided:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`
    *   **User's Input URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` (The student has entered the suggested local host URL).
*   **Validation Method:** "We'll check by sending a GET request to this URL with `?q=...` containing a task." - This specifies how the automated grader will test the endpoint: a GET request with a query parameter named `q` that will contain the function call task.
*   **Argument Order:** "Arguments must be in the same order as the function definition." - A detail for correct API response validation.

**4. Error Message:**
The primary issue displayed in the screenshot:
*   **Error Message:** `Error: Failed to fetch: Bad Request`
    *   **Analysis:** This indicates that the client (the grading system in this case) attempted to send a request to the provided URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`), but the server responded with an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" status code. This typically means the server understood the request but could not process it due to malformed syntax, invalid parameters, or missing required data in the request.

**5. Other Tasks (at bottom):**
*   "9 Get an LLM to say Yes (1 mark)" - Further confirms the LLM/AI context of the assignment.

**Summary of the Problem:**
The user's local API endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`) is returning a "Bad Request" error when the course grader tries to send a GET request to it. This suggests a problem with how the API is handling the incoming GET request, specifically the `?q=` query parameter that is expected to contain the function call definition. Potential causes include:
*   The `q` parameter is not being correctly parsed by the student's API.
*   The content within the `q` parameter (the stringified JSON) is not being correctly interpreted or is missing.
*   The server expects a different request method (e.g., POST) or content type, despite the instruction specifying GET.
*   CORS is not properly configured on the student's local server.*



  
all other questions i have finished. even in Ga2 all these api and flask creates a lot of issues. if there is any complete guide to understand this also pls help us.

I have counted the number of tokens in gpt-4o-mini but when I was entering the answer in portal it was showing incorrect please take a look and provide a solution for it .  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot depicts the OpenAI Platform Playground, a user interface for interacting with OpenAI's language models.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Platform & Model Selection:**
*   **Platform:** OpenAI Platform
*   **Selected Model:** "GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini" is highlighted, indicating it's the currently active model.
*   **Other Available Models:** "GPT-3.5 & GPT-4" and "GPT-3 (Legacy)" are also visible as selectable tabs.

**2. User Prompt/Instruction:**
*   Above the main text area, a prompt is partially visible: "List only the valid English words from the chest." This indicates the user's instruction to the AI.

**3. AI Output/Response:**
*   The large text area contains the response generated by the AI model.
*   **Crucially, nearly all the "words" in the output have red squiggly underlines**, which typically signifies a spell-check or grammar-check indicating that these are not recognized as valid words. This suggests the AI either failed to correctly filter valid English words from an implied input, or the output itself is the "chest" of words the prompt refers to, and the model is failing to identify valid words within it. Given the instruction, it's more likely the AI *failed* to output only valid English words.

**4. Transcribed Output (exactly as it appears, including red squiggly highlights noted):**
(Note: Red squiggly underlines are indicated by `[squiggle]` notation for clarity)

`[squiggle]eWHNetl, [squiggle]eGEib, 9, [squiggle]kZFurXr, [squiggle]Pnti2d0, [squiggle]HnV66V0, [squiggle]cR9zhyBi, NL, [squiggle]9T1DU3, [squiggle]DaRw,`
`[squiggle]9irI10, [squiggle]6AIKKKHU, [squiggle]FJ7XYUt, [squiggle]ZBFu30, TH, B, [squiggle]EuaXvr4Vyp, YC, [squiggle]Ii6J4dJPn, [squiggle]pTWN,`
`[squiggle]EZshp, [squiggle]eET, [squiggle]U163LMWSw, D, s, [squiggle]VvBmRL3t, [squiggle]O3YTvv, [squiggle]mx6N, [squiggle]qLVNE, PF, [squiggle]Bt1lSAW8jP,`
`[squiggle]F1jqXwYzy, [squiggle]uQJIS, [squiggle]XjNNS, [squiggle]89NSMaNWrH, [squiggle]z017vbI, [squiggle]Hzb2, [squiggle]TZbpJdLQ, [squiggle]DRmAKXE,`
`[squiggle]bjq80YiSGG, [squiggle]VvJ0DT, [squiggle]2VL, [squiggle]dHyrz, [squiggle]kQFDUi3pf, [squiggle]joAB7U1c, [squiggle]Mzhkjz8oQI, J, [squiggle]L8wIWIF,`
`[squiggle]QA011c5yVQ, [squiggle]mNN0O4RJFX, [squiggle]xvX, [squiggle]rMeYNv, [squiggle]pC30jjkI, [squiggle]yguY0s85, [squiggle]fD1n0Qd, [squiggle]iPWS5, [squiggle]x0Kd,`
`[squiggle]tSWIafa0, [squiggle]7Kiy7Imj, [squiggle]FWs1n2s, [squiggle]LGsZ18GED, [squiggle]g6Skq, [squiggle]I3nUSc2, [squiggle]Nh6b, [squiggle]S0OX, 8,`
`[squiggle]qO1rAnQIz, [squiggle]0cyWnSIE, [squiggle]N5Uk, C`

**5. Output Metrics:**
*   **Tokens:** 406
*   **Characters:** 625
    *   These metrics indicate the length of the generated response as processed by the language model.

**6. User Interface Controls:**
*   **Buttons:**
    *   "Clear": To clear the current input/output.
    *   "Show example": Likely to load a pre-defined prompt and response to demonstrate capabilities.
*   **Navigation (Top Right):** "Docs", "API reference", and a partially visible "Log in" or "Logout" button are present, typical for a developer platform.

**In summary:** The screenshot shows a session in the OpenAI Playground where the GPT-4o model was instructed to filter valid English words. The output, however, appears to be a list of mostly non-standard, alphanumeric strings, all flagged with spelling errors by the interface, indicating the model did not successfully fulfill the "valid English words" aspect of the prompt.*

There are few more tokens for the user prompt, I think if you add 7 or 8 then you would get correct answer.

Other way to do this question is send a request to anand sir’s aiproxy and in response you will get number of input tokens.

I inspected the JavaScript code of this website, I saw that the answer took my input and added 7 to it, why is it programmed this way? Even if I were to use the AI proxy that was given shouldn’t the number of tokens remain unaffected?

When you send request to openai through anand sir’s proxy it takes some tokens for user prompt.

When you use tokenizer from openai’s webpage then it doesn’t take care of that.

For question 7

Sakshi6479:

> ```
> import openai
>
> ```

You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request

```
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}'
}

json_data = {
    'model':'gpt-4o-mini',
    'messages':[
        {
            'role':'user',
            'content':'What is 2+2?'
        }
    ]
}
r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0)

```

You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made.  
Url’s for free api keys:

1. [AI Proxy](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/)
2. [OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o/playground)

The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation [sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy).

---

For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order`.

Kind regards

Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log output from a console or terminal, illustrating the successful execution of operations within a local application, likely a document similarity or search service. The logs indicate interactions with an HTTP endpoint, data management, and a natural language query with its results.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application Type:** The application appears to be a local server or service running on `127.0.0.1:59423` that provides a `/similarity` endpoint. This suggests its primary function is to perform similarity searches or information retrieval on a collection of documents.
2.  **Lifecycle of Operations:**
    *   **Service Check:** An `OPTIONS` HTTP request was made to the `/similarity` endpoint, receiving a `200 OK` response. This is often a preflight request in web contexts, confirming the service is reachable and configured for cross-origin requests.
    *   **Data Management:**
        *   A "collection" was successfully reset.
        *   A new collection named "documents" was created.
        *   10 new documents were added to this database, preparing it for queries.
    *   **Query Execution:**
        *   A search query was initiated: "How is our internal training addressing cybersecurity challenges?"
        *   The system successfully found and returned three matches, indicating relevant documents were retrieved from the collection.
        *   This search operation was followed by a `POST` HTTP request to the `/similarity` endpoint, which also returned a `200 OK` status, confirming the successful processing of the query.
3.  **Functionality Demonstrated:** The output shows a complete flow for a text-based search system: setting up a document collection, populating it, and then querying it using natural language to retrieve relevant information. The content of the query and the matched documents (related to cybersecurity training, staff handbooks, and testing protocols) suggest a business or organizational knowledge base application.
4.  **Context (Data Science Course):** Given it's from a data science course forum, this output likely serves as a successful demonstration of concepts like information retrieval, natural language processing (NLP), text embedding, or vector similarity search, where a user can query a document database and get relevant results.

---

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*Note: There are no explicit "error messages." The lines below represent system output, including HTTP requests (which act as commands/interactions), status messages, and the display of the query and its results.*

```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:59423 - "OPTIONS /similarity HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
Collection reset successfully!
Created new collection: documents
Added 10 new documents to the database.
Searching for query: How is our internal training addressing cybersecurity challenges?
Found matches: ['Employee training on cybersecurity best practices is being rolled out company-wide.', 'The staff handbook has been updated to reflect current operational policies.', 'Our quality assurance team has implemented automated testing protocols.']
INFO:     127.0.0.1:59423 - "POST /similarity HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a common scenario in a data science or software development course where a user is asked to provide an API endpoint for their implementation and encounters an error.

**Key Information:**

*   **Prompt/Instruction:** The user is being asked for the "API URL endpoint" for their implementation. A suggested format is provided as an example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
*   **User Input:** The user has entered the exact URL provided in the example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The input field is highlighted with a red border and an exclamation mark icon, indicating an error.
*   **Error Message:** A detailed error message is displayed below the input field. The initial part, "Error: Got incorrect matches:", suggests that the system made a call to the provided API and the response did not match the expected output.
*   **Cryptic Error Details:** The subsequent part of the error message is highly unusual and seems completely unrelated to a typical API or network error. It reads like a corporate memo or a collection of internal company announcements, mentioning "Employee training on cybersecurity best practices," "The staff handbook has been updated," and "Our quality assurance team has implemented automated testing protocols." This suggests one of the following possibilities:
    *   The API endpoint the user is running is *actually returning this specific text* as its response, and the course's validation system is checking for a different, expected response.
    *   The validation system itself is misconfigured, displaying a generic or placeholder error message that is not relevant to the actual technical issue.
    *   Less likely, but possible in some advanced or "puzzle-like" courses: the error message is a deliberate hint or a challenge where the user needs to figure out why the API is returning this specific, unexpected text.

**Transcription:**

*   **Prompt Text:**
    ```
    What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity
    ```
*   **Code/Command (Entered URL):**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity
    ```
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Error: Got incorrect matches: Employee training on cybersecurity best practices is being rolled out company-wide.,The staff handbook has been updated to reflect current operational policies.,Our quality assurance team has implemented automated testing protocols.
    ```*



I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an API testing client (likely Postman, given its interface) being used to interact with a local web service, likely developed as part of a data science or machine learning course due to the nature of the content.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Client & Request Setup:**
*   **Application:** An API testing client (e.g., Postman).
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`
    *   This indicates the request is being sent to a local server (localhost, port 8000) at the `/similarity` endpoint. This endpoint likely processes some input to find "similar" items or perform a similarity calculation.
*   **Authorization:** The "Authorization" tab is active, and the "Auth Type" is set to `No Auth`.
    *   **Message:** `This request does not use any authorization.`
*   **Request Body:** The "Body" tab in the request configuration area has a green dot, indicating that a request body is present, though its content is not visible in this specific screenshot. For a POST request to a `/similarity` endpoint, the request body would typically contain the data to be processed for similarity (e.g., a query string or a list of items).

**2. API Response Details:**
*   **Response Status:** `200 OK` (Displayed in green, indicating a successful request).
*   **Response Time:** `17.26 s` (This is a relatively long response time, which might be a point of discussion in a forum if performance is a concern for the data science model or API).
*   **Response Size:** `232 B`
*   **Response Body Content Type:** `JSON` (Selected in the dropdown).
*   **Response Body (JSON Payload):** The API returned a JSON object containing a list under the key `"matches"`. This suggests the `/similarity` endpoint successfully processed the request and returned a list of items it deemed "matches" or relevant based on a similarity metric.

**Transcribed Code/Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Request URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`
*   **Authorization Type:** `No Auth`
*   **Authorization Message:** `This request does not use any authorization.`
*   **HTTP Status Code and Message:** `200 OK`
*   **Response Time:** `17.26 s`
*   **Response Size:** `232 B`
*   **JSON Response Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "matches": [
        "FastAPI is great for APIs.",
        "Embedding models improve NLP.",
        "Machine learning is evolving."
      ]
    }
    ```*



I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

```
class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
    query: str       # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)


.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])

```

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that

```

Check if your response is in this format.

### Post #140 by **Matlin Jeleshiya ** (ds-students)
*February 05, 2025, 18:48 UTC*
Does the final submission get graded, or is the highest-scoring submission considered?

I’m facing an issue where my score dropped from 8 to 6.5 when I checked all the answers one last time before submitting. I suspect the drop is due to the 3rd and 7th questions.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a list of "Recent saves" from what appears to be an interactive coding environment or assignment platform within a data science course. Each entry represents a previously saved state of a user's work, along with an associated score and the timestamp of the save.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Title:** "Recent saves" - This clearly indicates a history of saved work or attempts.
2.  **Functionality:** Each save entry has a "Reload" button, suggesting that users can revert to or load a specific past version of their work. This is highly useful for reviewing previous attempts, continuing from a specific point, or comparing different solutions.
3.  **Save Details:** Each save is accompanied by:
    *   **Date and Time:** A precise timestamp (Month/Day/Year, Hour:Minute:Second AM/PM). All displayed saves are from `2/5/2025`. The fact that the date is in the future (from current perspective) often indicates a placeholder, a test environment, or a future-dated assignment.
    *   **Score:** A numerical score is associated with each save. This strongly implies that the work being saved is part of an assessed activity (e.g., a coding assignment, quiz, or project submission) where automated or semi-automated grading provides immediate feedback.
4.  **Progress Tracking:** The list shows multiple saves on the same day (`2/5/2025`) with varying scores:
    *   `11:59:18 PM`: Score: 6.5
    *   `11:30:37 PM`: Score: 8
    *   `10:44:08 PM`: Score: 6.5
    This suggests a user making iterative attempts, where an earlier attempt (11:30:37 PM) yielded the highest score (8), and a later attempt (11:59:18 PM) resulted in a slightly lower score (6.5), similar to the earliest recorded save. This could indicate refinement, but also potential regressions or different approaches yielding different results.

**Inferred Context for a Data Science Course Forum:**

Students might post screenshots like this to:
*   Ask why a later save yielded a lower score.
*   Discuss strategies for improving scores on specific assignments.
*   Seek help understanding why a particular save received a certain score.
*   Inquire about the best way to utilize the "Reload" feature to improve their final submission.
*   Highlight a successful attempt (like the one with a score of 8) and share their approach.

**Transcription of visible text (excluding button functionality):**

```
Recent saves
Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:59:18 PM. Score: 6.5
Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:30:37 PM. Score: 8
Reload from 2/5/2025, 10:44:08 PM. Score: 6.5
```
*(There are no code, commands, or error messages present in this specific screenshot, only descriptive text and functional labels.)**

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures the instructions for an online assessment or lab activity titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language M" (likely "Large Language Models"). It provides crucial details about the assessment environment, submission policy, and allowed resources.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Assessment Overview & Status:**
*   **Assessment Title:** TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language M (likely "Large Language Models")
*   **Status:** [Admin] view, indicating an administrator or special mode.
*   **End Time/Deadline:** Wednesday, 5 February, 2025, 11:59 pm IST.
*   **Current Score:** 0 (zero)
*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   `Check all`
    *   `Save`

**Instructions (Numbered Points):**

1.  **Learning Approach:** Reading material is provided, but users are free to skip it if they can answer the questions. Learning is also encouraged "just for pleasure."
2.  **Checking Answers:** Answers can be checked regularly by pressing a `Check` button (implied to be per-question or section, distinct from `Check all`). This reveals right/wrong answers, and users can check multiple times.
3.  **Saving Progress:** Users should `Save` regularly. **Crucially, the "Your last saved submission will be evaluated."** This means only the final saved state is graded.
4.  **Reloading & Data Storage:** Reloading the page is permissible. Answers are saved **in the user's browser (client-side), not on the server.** Questions will remain consistent, except for randomized parameters.
5.  **Browser Performance:** The browser may experience loading issues. Users are advised to turn off security restrictions or try a different browser if problems occur.
6.  **Allowed Resources:** This is an **open-resource** assessment. Users are explicitly permitted to use "anything," including the Internet, ChatGPT, friends, and any libraries or frameworks.
7.  **"Hackability":** **The assessment is explicitly stated to be "hackable."** It's possible to determine answers by "hacking the code for this quiz," and this is **"allowed."**

**Important Note:**
*   **Technical Requirement:** Users are required to "run multiple servers in this exam." All these servers "must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers."

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
No explicit code snippets or error messages are present. Commands are implied by the following text or button labels:

*   `Check all` (button label)
*   `Save` (button label)
*   `Check` (referenced in instruction 2 as a button to press)
*   `Save` (referenced in instruction 3 as a button to press)*



The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum… just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a bar chart, similar to a histogram, showing the distribution of student scores for an assignment or assessment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Chart Title:**
*   `GA3 Active Score Distribution`
    *   This indicates the chart visualizes scores for "GA3" (likely "Graded Assignment 3" or similar).

**Axes:**
*   **X-axis (Horizontal):** Labeled `Scores`.
    *   Represents score ranges (bins) from 0 to 100.
    *   The bins are: `0`, `(0, 10]`, `(10, 20]`, `(20, 30]`, `(30, 40]`, `(40, 50]`, `(50, 60]`, `(60, 70]`, `(70, 80]`, `(80, 90]`, `(90, 100]`.
    *   Note: The `0` bin likely represents students who scored exactly zero. The other bins are open on the left and closed on the right (e.g., `(0, 10]` means scores greater than 0 and up to and including 10).
*   **Y-axis (Vertical):** Labeled `GA2 Student Count`.
    *   **Discrepancy:** While the chart title refers to "GA3" scores, the Y-axis explicitly states "GA2 Student Count". Given the tooltip refers to "ga3 student count" for the data point, it's highly probable the Y-axis label `GA2 Student Count` is a typo and should be `GA3 Student Count`.
    *   The axis ranges from 0 to 250, with major grid lines at 50, 100, 150, 200, 250.

**Data (Student Counts per Score Bin):**
The number on top of each bar indicates the count of students within that score range:
*   Score `0`: `12` students
*   Score `(0, 10]`: `42` students
*   Score `(10, 20]`: `49` students
*   Score `(20, 30]`: `62` students
*   Score `(30, 40]`: `55` students
*   Score `(40, 50]`: `59` students
*   Score `(50, 60]`: `93` students
*   Score `(60, 70]`: `104` students
*   Score `(70, 80]`: `91` students
*   Score `(80, 90]`: `35` students
*   Score `(90, 100]`: `249` students

**Hover-over Tooltip (for the (90, 100] bin):**
The tooltip displays detailed information for the currently hovered bar:
*   Score Range: `(90, 100]`
*   Student Count: `ga3 student count: 249`

**Key Observations/Trends:**
*   **Strong Performance in High Scores:** The most prominent feature is the very large number of students (249) in the highest score range of (90, 100], indicating that a significant portion of the class performed exceptionally well.
*   **Middle Performance Cluster:** There's a notable cluster of students scoring between (50, 60] (93 students), (60, 70] (104 students), and (70, 80] (91 students). This suggests a substantial group of students achieved moderately good scores.
*   **Fewer Low Scores:** Relatively few students scored in the lowest ranges (0-50). The lowest counts are for scores of 0 (12 students) and (80, 90] (35 students).
*   **Distribution Shape:** The distribution is heavily skewed towards the higher scores, with a sharp peak at the very top. There's also a secondary, broader peak in the 50-80 range.

**Transcribed Text:**
*   **Chart Title:** `GA3 Active Score Distribution`
*   **Y-axis Label:** `GA2 Student Count`
*   **X-axis Label:** `Scores`
*   **X-axis Bins (from left to right):** `0`, `(0, 10]`, `(10, 20]`, `(20, 30]`, `(30, 40]`, `(40, 50]`, `(50, 60]`, `(60, 70]`, `(70, 80]`, `(80, 90]`, `(90, 100]`
*   **Bar Values (from left to right):** `12`, `42`, `49`, `62`, `55`, `59`, `93`, `104`, `91`, `35`, `249`
*   **Tooltip Content:**
    *   `(90, 100]`
    *   `ga3 student count: 249`

**No code, commands, or explicit error messages are visible in the image beyond the noted discrepancy in the Y-axis label.***

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

I am getting this error :  
Error: The image\_url.url must be the base64 data URL of the image  
I verified that my Base64 encoding for the image is correct ..

Try this - right click on image and click open in new tab, in the new tab you will see the base64 url of image in chrome tab url bar  
Hope this helps

**Realizing the Value of Collaboration**

As I’ve been going through this course, one thing that’s really started to make sense to me is how important collaboration is. None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.

I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.

This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.  
if somebody feels the same then Reply , Thankyou

For Question 3, I was able to enable the answer box but the answer is always saying that either it is not valid json format or Error: Model must be gpt-4o-mini, not undefined.

I have tried multiple approaches but the same issue even after using help from Chat GPT. Could any one tell what is the correct answer?? Thanks!

Here is my response for not valid json format error:

```

    }
  ],

That’s true, that’s how real world works, working in silos doesn’t apply outside controlled environment. Pretty good course for the same purpose

For Questions 8 to 10 of GA3 how and where should we host the URL to receive and handle the responses effectively?

For qn 8-10, the API is working as expected locally, but I’m now unsure about how to **deploy** it in a way that allows you to send a POST request to a public URL.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a set of instructions and requirements for a programming exercise within a data science course, specifically focusing on building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Project Goal:** TechDocs Inc. aims to build a next-generation documentation search system using RAG to provide factual answers to developer questions by referencing documentation.
2.  **Exercise Focus:** The current exercise is a small proof-of-concept where the student must implement a RAG system that answers questions based on the "TypeScript Book" available on GitHub.
3.  **Expected System Output (internal/server-side):**
    *   First, print raw matched snippets from the documentation.
    *   Then, generate a concise, streamed Large Language Model (LLM) answer that directly cites the relevant note.
4.  **API Endpoint Requirements:**
    *   **Method:** Accepts `GET` requests.
    *   **Endpoint Path:** `/search`
    *   **Query Parameter:** Requires a `q` parameter for the `question_text`.
    *   **Response Format:** Must be a JSON object.
    *   **Response Content:**
        *   A required `answer` field (string) containing the relevant documentation excerpt.
        *   An optional `sources` field (string) for references to the source document.
    *   **Accuracy:** The response must include the *exact* answer required for each question.
    *   **CORS:** Must be enabled to allow requests from any origin.
5.  **Testing Mechanism:** The system will test the student's API endpoint by sending questions and verifying the responses against expected answers. The student provides their endpoint URL in an input field.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Example Questions and Expected Answers:**
    *   Q: "What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?"
    *   A: `fat arrow`
    *   Q: "Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?"
    *   A: `!!`

*   **TypeScript Book Reference URL:**
    `https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/`

*   **API Endpoint Query Parameter Specification:**
    `/search?q=question_text`

*   **Expected JSON Response Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "string containing the relevant documentation excerpt",
      "sources": "optional: references to source document"
    }
    ```

*   **Example URL for RAG API endpoint:**
    `http://localhost:8000/search`

*   **Entered URL in the input field:**
    `http://127.0.0.1:8010/search`

*   **Button Text:**
    `Check`*



  
Can someone tell me what was the output format of this question because i solved it and got the output which seemed correct enough to me but still got marked incorrect. Any help will be appreciated

One issue is there in

```
"response_format": "json"  // incorrect 

```

Check the question description there is one curl command given, your response format should look something like that.
