Hi Nilay,

In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)

kind regards

Hi [@22f3001315](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3001315) ,

You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.

Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body [Vision - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).

Kind regards

The API key is available at <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/>

The instructions on how to use the token is given at [GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

Hi Nilay,

Yes you would need to use `text-embedding-3-small` model of openai for embedding questions.

i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, **is there any solution to this problem?**

The overall score is "2.75 / 8.5". The "Questions" section lists nine different LLM-related topics, each associated with a specific mark value, ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 marks.  Available actions are "Check" and "Save".



Why is my score is out of 8.5? It should be 9.5 right?  
It was 9.5 before a reload.

> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a coding exercise within a data science course forum. The task is to write a Python function named `most_similar(embeddings)` that computes the cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings and returns the pair with the highest similarity. The provided `embeddings` variable is a dictionary mapping phrases to vector embeddings. An error message "NameError: name 'most_similar' is not defined" indicates that the function `most_similar` was either not defined or called before its definition within the designated coding area.



For question no.6, there was some pre-written code there, right?  
I am not able to see it now.

I tried downloading image for your dataset it is 2.36 KB in size.  
Using base64 encoded string from `image_url.url` in your code when decoded comes out to be 8.18 KB, when I encoded image from your dataset and decoded it was 2.36 KB.

Hi VIKASH,

This problem must be because CORS not enabled or you are running your application inside wsl, if you using WSL then you would need to identify ipaddress of WSL and use it in place of `127.0.0.1`

each time when I run the following code it gives me different number. None of the answer is correct. can help to fix the issue  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows Python code interacting with the OpenAI API's chat completions endpoint. The code prepares a JSON payload for the API request, sends a POST request using `requests.post()`, and parses the JSON response. It checks `response.status_code == 200` to determine success and attempts to extract "total_tokens" from the response JSON. If the request fails, it prints a message indicating the failure and includes the status code and JSON response. The code also displays "Input tokens used" along with a number at the bottom of the screen.

**Role:**  ds-students

Hello Sir,

I am unable to recieve a proper output for q1 of ga3.  
This is my test message. Its been given in two lines.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays two lines of seemingly random alphanumeric strings. The first line contains "2 b7 rkS94mn4," while the second line shows "AM dNG4j EVEvK24Ev VEpiI G LeeHS." There is no clear context or indication of the strings' purpose or origin within a specific programming language or tool. This snippet appears to represent either obfuscated data, generated identifiers, or placeholder text. Without further context, pinpointing the exact nature of the issue is not possible.



The below is my code for the question.

```
import httpx

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

system_message = "Analyze the input message if it's  GOOD , BAD or NEUTRAL."
user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4  AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"

payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},  # System message
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}       # One user message
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7
}

response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

for choice in result["choices"]:
    print("AI Response:", choice["message"]["content"])

```

I tried to put the two test lines as two user messages but received an error stating that the json body must contain only 2 messages with one mandatorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a code snippet defining a `payload` variable. An error message is displayed indicating a problem with the user message within the payload.  The error states: "Error: The user message must be 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS, not 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS". This suggests a validation issue where the user message is being compared against an identical string, implying a potential bug in the validation logic or an unexpected duplicate value.



Kindly advice on how to proceed.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hi Shalini,

Your `user_message` is incorrect. I looked at your exact GA and it works if you make sure your `user_message` is precisely what is given to you.

Hi team, I am using OpenAI API key for solving Q7 and getting the error like below

```
{'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

Is it necessary to pay for the OpenAI API key? Is there any other way?

For those who want to experiment with GPT-4o Mini (or other models), [Github Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) is free. You can explore and compare models, including GPT-4o Mini, DeepSeek R1, and others.

It has rate limits, so you can’t use it in production, but is a good place to prototype applications and experiment with prompts.

Please let me know if you face any problems accessing it.

Q2 LLM Token Cost ,

We have <https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer> , which helps us count tokens in a string, shouldn’t this be a better way than calling the API? However the returned value does not show as correct answer!

Hi guys, just wanted to share that I found it hysterical when I saw this question:  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a graded assignment related to creating a JSON body for an OpenAI chat completion call. The task involves generating plausible address data using the "gpt-4o-mini" model. Error messages indicate issues with the JSON structure, specifically the absence of a "required" field and the requirement to set "additionalProperties" to false. The instructions outline the expected data format, including "system message," "user message," and structured outputs with specified fields like "apartment," "zip," and "latitude." The "Check" button suggests the task is to provide the correct JSON in an input box not visible in the screenshot.



  
Like I literally showed this question to my mother and younger bro, stating the fact we ourselves had enable the answer box, they laughed there pants off…  
More courses could be like this.

s3 string was given by

```
image_b64 = ""
import base64
with open('/content/TDS_wk3_q4.png', 'rb') as f:
    binary_data = f.read()
    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()
data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}"

```

  
s4 string given by :   

used this [link](https://www.base64-image.de/)  to generate image url  
  
 Then checked them both, they were the same

```
for x,y in zip(s3,s4):
  if (x != y):
    print(x,y)

```

i verified that both were equal but still one gave the wrong answer(python code), while the online converter gave the right one?  
I know i’m missing something, but why?

> **Image:** The user is attempting to write a Python function `most_similar(embeddings)` that calculates cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings and returns the most similar pair. The provided code imports `numpy` and defines the function with a placeholder comment, but immediately returns a tuple `(phrase1, phrase2)`. The "Incorrect answer" button indicates a failed submission. The traceback shows a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined` within the `most_similar` function. The error stems from trying to return `phrase1` and `phrase2` without defining them within the function.

This is in context to Q8. This is a screenshot of the response I am getting when i run the same API on my FastAPI/docs response page, it gives the correct response.

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding 7th and 8th question. I am getting this error of expecting three matches while saving. But, Externally when I check this API, I tried considerable test cases, and I am getting the output correctly. Can you please check this and give a solution. Thank You  


> **Image:** The screenshot displays a Python dictionary with a single key-value pair. The key is 'matches', and the value is a list of strings: ['banana', 'watermelon', 'jamaica']. This output could potentially be from a string matching or search algorithm, with "matches" indicating the successful results. No error messages or other UI elements are present in the visible section of the screenshot. The focus of the screenshot is the raw data structure.

  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows an error within a UI element likely related to API endpoint configuration. The user is prompted to input their API URL endpoint, similar to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The current input, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`, triggers the error message "Error: Expected 3 matches," indicating a validation failure or incorrect format. The preceding text suggests a possible issue with CORS configuration, specifically OPTIONS and POST methods.

This is regarding the 8th question. Same here, I am getting the answer for all the test cases, but then also, I am getting error in the portal while saving. Please help me out here. Thank You.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON response from a local server (127.0.0.1:8001) after executing an endpoint "/execute".  The URL includes a query parameter `q` which is URL-encoded string representing a request to "Calculate performance bonus for employee 10056 for 2025". The JSON response indicates the called function is "calculate_performance_bonus" with arguments being the employee ID (10056) and current year (2025). The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the raw JSON is formatted for readability. The server seems to be processing a request to dynamically call a function with specific parameters.

Use addition : to add up your score for each question.  
eq:  
1+ 1 = 2  
Fractions are harder  
1.5 + 1 = 2.5



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a list of questions related to a data science course or assignment. The questions focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application in areas like sentiment analysis, token cost estimation, address generation, vision tasks, and embedding generation. Other questions target embedding similarity, vector databases and function calling with LLMs. Each question is assigned a specific mark value for evaluation, indicating their relative complexity or importance. The questions seem to be designed to test the understanding of LLM principles and practical usage.

To this question I have checked values ranging from 6 to 13 none of them are correct, using openAI Tokenizer online tool.  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a question from an online data science course, focusing on LLM token cost. The prompt requires the user to identify valid English words from a provided string "List only the valid English words from these:". The user must then determine the number of input tokens this message uses and input it into the "Number of tokens:" field. The page has "Check" buttons to submit the answer. The score is displayed as "Score: 0/9.5".



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the OpenAI tokenizer interface at "platform.openai.com/tokenizer". The user has entered the text "List only the valid English words from these:". The interface displays that this text has 10 tokens and 47 characters. UI elements include "Clear" and "Show example" buttons, as well as tabs to switch between "Text" and "Token IDs" views.  The interface also mentions the `tiktoken` package for Python and JavaScript for programmatic tokenization.

CORS configuration is also mentioned as a possible source of error (related to OPTIONS and POST methods).

Try sending an api call to openai.

Check with network tab, you would see the response of api call being made, Compare that with expected output.

Regrading question 8, you would need to check if cors are enabled, check in browser console tab for more.

The Response tab shows the content of one of the requests: `{"acc":1,"webResult":{}}`. The UI indicates that the "Fetch/XHR" filter is active, showing only asynchronous HTTP requests. The timeline visualization displays the timing of these requests relative to each other.

> rm me where I did mistake

Sorry but im facing an issue with question 6 and 7 where its saying load failed when I submit it. when I run the queries locally using curl im getting the expected results. Any help would be appreciated.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a form for submitting an API endpoint URL, specifically `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute`, which is marked as invalid. An error message "TypeError: Load failed" indicates a problem when trying to access this URL.  The system will verify the URL by sending a GET request with query parameters `?q=...`. The instructions state CORS must be enabled, and that the arguments must be in order. The "Check" button suggests a validation process.



```
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute?q=What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742?"

{"name":"get_ticket_status","arguments":"{\"ticket_id\": 83742}"}

For question 2, do we have to make the API call to the proxy or openai? If to the proxy, are there any instructions on the page *before* question 2 that would have pointed me in that direction?

The error message "SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON" suggests a problem with the response being returned from the server for a check.

there is a problem in question 7 and 8, fast api question, when i click on save, both api calls happens at once at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), and i can run fast api app for question 7 or 8 for one only, suppose i check for question 7 it shows correct, also for question 8 i check it shows correct , but when i try to save one of the answer gets incorrected because of simultaneous calls by question 7 and 8 at this address [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science course forum related to building a similarity service. The service flow outlined involves POST requests with JSON payloads containing "docs" and "query". The API calculates text embeddings using "text-embedding-3-small" and computes cosine similarity.

I tried checking the JSON Output in the Networks tab. I am getting error as “Method Not Found”. But, I have allowed POST Method for question 7 as POST method is used in the question. I also tried checking my API by sending a POST request by the same parameters as given by the Website. I am getting the proper response when I give an API request. Can you please help me out here? I have attached the screenshot of the error as Picture -1 and the correct output what I get as Picture-2. Please help me out as I am facing issue for all the API Questions though I am getting the right output. Thank You.  


> **Image:** The screenshot displays a JSON response with a "detail" field containing the message "Method Not Allowed". This error typically indicates that the HTTP method used in the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is not supported by the endpoint being accessed. The JSON format suggests an API interaction is failing. Without further context, it's impossible to know which method was attempted and why it's not allowed. The user should check the API documentation or endpoint configuration.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays Python code intended for calculating cosine similarity between word embeddings. The code iterates through a list of words, calculates the dot product of embeddings, appends the result to `dot_product_df`, and returns the maximum dot product. An error occurs during execution, indicated by "TypeError: Z.runPython(...).toJs is not a function". This suggests a problem within the execution environment related to JavaScript interoperability, possibly stemming from the environment used by the data science course. The code also shows a printed output of vector embeddings, likely related to the user's text input.

Hi,

I’m sorry if I’m asking an unrelated question, But I’m very confused with the concept of generating the token from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

Could any one suggest the step by step process? I couldn’t able to find that similar question asked by anyone since the conversations are vast.

Please guide me on this. Also do i need to use my personal mail id or iitm mail id for accessing this token

The error shows your code is getting wrong answers for the test cases. I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to <http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings> with required headers. And, then calculate `similarity_scores` simply using  
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}  
which in python syntax is-

```
np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

```

Sir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You  


> **Image:** The screenshot displays an error message formatted as a Python dictionary.  The key "error" contains a dictionary with the key "message". The error message states: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details."  The problem seems to be related to exceeding the allowed resource usage or budget limit for the service being used. The user should review their account settings to determine quota limits and billing status. There are no UI elements or data visualizations present in the screenshot.

This is my code for the 7th question of finding similarities. This code, I tried on my own, but it is showing Incorrect Matches. I think so it is due to the Aliababa GTE Model. Please correct me if I have gone wrong anywhere. Thank You

Both the api based questions i am unable to get the output it always says bad request  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows Python code attempting to parse user queries. The `parse_query` function in `main.py` uses regular expressions to match different query formats, including "arrange meeting..." The terminal output indicates errors with "Query format did not match any predefined patterns" and "400 Bad Request" for the "arrange meeting" query. The regex `r"(?i)(arrange\s*meeting|schedule\s*a\s*meeting)\s*(?:on\s*)?(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` appears to be the problematic pattern, likely failing to correctly parse the date/time format from the input string.

The interface indicates a requirement to enable CORS for GET requests, which might be the root cause. The system is attempting to send a GET request with `?q=...` and validates the response against the function definition provided as JSON: `{"name": "get_ticket_status", "arguments": "{\"ticket_id\": 83742}"}`.

There are few more tokens for the user prompt, I think if you add 7 or 8 then you would get correct answer.

Other way to do this question is send a request to anand sir’s aiproxy and in response you will get number of input tokens.

I inspected the JavaScript code of this website, I saw that the answer took my input and added 7 to it, why is it programmed this way? Even if I were to use the AI proxy that was given shouldn’t the number of tokens remain unaffected?

When you send request to openai through anand sir’s proxy it takes some tokens for user prompt.

When you use tokenizer from openai’s webpage then it doesn’t take care of that.

For question 7

Sakshi6479:

> ```
> import openai
>
> ```

You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request

```
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}'
}

json_data = {
    'model':'gpt-4o-mini',
    'messages':[
        {
            'role':'user',
            'content':'What is 2+2?'
        }
    ]
}
r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0)

```

You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made.  
Url’s for free api keys:

1. [AI Proxy](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/)
2. [OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o/playground)

The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation [sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy).

---

For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order`.

Kind regards

Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows log output related to a similarity search API. A collection named "documents" is created, populated with 10 new documents, and then reset. A query, "How is our internal training addressing cybersecurity challenges?", is submitted to the "/similarity" endpoint via a POST request. The API returns a list of three matching documents related to cybersecurity training. Both OPTIONS and POST requests to the "/similarity" endpoint return a 200 OK status.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science course forum where a student is attempting to provide the API URL. The input field contains the value "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity".  Beneath the input field, an error message is displayed: "Error: Got incorrect matches: Employee training on cybersecurity best practices is being rolled out company-wide., The staff handbook has been updated to reflect current operational policies.,Our quality assurance team has implemented automated testing protocols.". This message indicates the provided API URL is not producing the expected results, although the connection itself is working, it may be fetching irrelevant or incorrect data. The question prompt suggests the URL format should resemble "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity", implying the student may have correctly entered the expected URL.



I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a successful POST request to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity" within a Postman-like interface, indicated by the "200 OK" status. The request body, formatted as JSON, contains a list of strings under the key "matches": ["FastAPI is great for APIs.", "Embedding models improve NLP.", "Machine learning is evolving."]. The Authorization tab is set to "No Auth," implying the API endpoint does not require authentication. The presence of "Headers (8)" and "Headers (4)" suggest header information might be relevant to the request or response.



I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

```
class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
    query: str       # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)


.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])

```

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that

Does the final submission get graded, or is the highest-scoring submission considered?

I’m facing an issue where my score dropped from 8 to 6.5 when I checked all the answers one last time before submitting. I suspect the drop is due to the 3rd and 7th questions.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a "Recent saves" section, listing three saved states from 2/5/2025 with timestamps. Each save has a "Reload" button, allowing the user to revert to that specific point. Associated with each save is a "Score" value, likely representing some performance metric at that saved state; "Score: 6.5," "Score: 8," and "Score: 6.5." The UI element suggests the user is facing a problem and wants to reload the saved state. There are no visible code snippets or error messages.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows the instructions for a data science quiz named "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language M". The instructions emphasize regularly checking answers by pressing "Check" and saving progress by pressing "Save," and notes that "Your last saved submission will be evaluated." It also informs users that reloading the page is acceptable and that browser issues may require turning off security restrictions. The quiz is described as "hackable" and encourages utilizing external resources, even allowing multiple servers to be run simultaneously. The UI contains buttons like "Check all" and "Save" with a score counter at the top.



The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum… just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.

Each bar represents a score interval (e.g., "[0, 10]", "[10, 20]", "[90, 100]"), and the height of the bar indicates the number of students within that range.  Notably, the bar for the range "[90, 100]" is significantly higher, with a count of 249, as displayed in a tooltip on the right. The x-axis is labeled "Scores."

Getting the same issue -

    Generate a curl command to fetch ONLY the top 18 most-starred repositories
    from the "stripe" organization using the GitHub API.
    Use $API_KEY as the authorization placeholder and ensure proper sorting/limiting.

        value: |
          The response should be a valid curl command that:
          - Uses the GitHub organization repositories endpoint for "stripe"
          - Limits results to exactly 18 repositories
          - Sorts by stars in descending order
          - Uses $API_KEY as the authorization placeholder
        name: "LLM rubric: task compliance" ```

**Realizing the Value of Collaboration**

As I’ve been going through this course, one thing that’s really started to make sense to me is how important collaboration is. None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.

I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.

This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.

For Question 3, I was able to enable the answer box but the answer is always saying that either it is not valid json format or Error: Model must be gpt-4o-mini, not undefined.

I have tried multiple approaches but the same issue even after using help from Chat GPT. Could any one tell what is the correct answer?? Thanks!

Here is my response for not valid json format error:

```

      "role": "system",

    }
  ],

    {
      "type": "function",

                "required": ["apartment", "city", "street"],
                "additionalProperties": false
              }

          },
          "required": ["addresses"],

That’s true, that’s how real world works, working in silos doesn’t apply outside controlled environment. Pretty good course for the same purpose

For Questions 8 to 10 of GA3 how and where should we host the URL to receive and handle the responses effectively?

For qn 8-10, the API is working as expected locally, but I’m now unsure about how to **deploy** it in a way that allows you to send a POST request to a public URL.

> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a data science exercise focused on building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.  The task involves creating an API endpoint, `/search?q=question_text`, that accepts GET requests with a query parameter. The API should return a JSON object with "answer" and "sources" fields containing relevant text excerpts from a TypeScript book and the source document references, respectively. The user provides the URL for their RAG API endpoint, currently set to "http://127.0.0.1:8010/search," for testing via a "Check" button. The documentation explicitly requires CORS to be enabled.



  
Can someone tell me what was the output format of this question because i solved it and got the output which seemed correct enough to me but still got marked incorrect. Any help will be appreciated

One issue is there in

```
"response_format": "json"  // incorrect 

```

Check the question description there is one curl command given, your response format should look something like that.
