The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot functions as a title card or section divider for a specific module within an online data science course.

**Key Information:**

*   **Course Progress Indicator:** The most prominent information is the large, white text overlay, which clearly identifies the current part of the course:

    ```
    WEEK 3
    SESSION 1
    ```
    This indicates that the course is structured into weekly segments, and this particular image marks the beginning of the first session within Week 3.

*   **Thematic Background Imagery:** The background features a collage of stylized, flat-design icons and illustrations directly related to data science, technology, and learning. These visual elements include:
    *   Various data visualization types (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, area charts).
    *   Network diagrams or circuit board patterns, possibly representing data flow, algorithms, or neural networks.
    *   Tools like pencils (suggesting design, coding, or learning) and a wrench (implying data manipulation or engineering).
    *   A monitor or laptop screen displaying abstract lines, reminiscent of code or data output.
    *   A globe, indicating global data or connectivity.
    *   A target or dashboard dial, symbolizing analysis and metrics.

*   **Purpose:** The image serves as a clear visual cue for students to identify and navigate the course content, signaling the start of a new lesson or segment.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are no specific code snippets, command lines, or error messages visible or transcribable in this image. The lines displayed on the simulated monitor screen in the background are abstract visual elements, not actual code.*

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards
