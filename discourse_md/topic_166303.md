The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

> **Image:** This screenshot depicts the title card for a data science course, specifically "Week 3 SESSION 1". The background consists of various data-related icons, including a compass, interconnected network, bars, lines, a globe, a pie chart and different graphs and charts. There are no visible code snippets, error messages, or UI elements directly related to troubleshooting a technical issue, nor is it possible to tell what software or tools are used in this course from this image. The focus is on announcing the start of a specific session within the course.

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

The browser has several tabs open, including "Large language models," and speed dial shortcuts to various resources like "DS Discourse," "App Dev II Project Doc...," "(159) Tools in Data Scie...," "Java Tutorial | Learn Jav...," "Prime Number Progra...," "PDSA," "tds june 2024," and "MAD-2 resources." A message "Activate Windows Go to Settings to activate Windows" is displayed at the bottom of the screen indicating the user's Windows installation is not activated.  There are no visible code snippets or error messages directly related to data science. No data visualizations or charts are present.

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a data science course forum page focusing on "Data Sourcing". The module outlines key tasks: "Control Extraction Area" and "Save Extracted Data," along with references like "PDF Scraping - Notebook" and "Learn about the pandas package".  A section titled "Optional: Real-life scraping" describes a live session exploring data scraping from emarketer.com. No error messages or code are displayed, but the forum UI with modules, grades, and inbox is visible on the left.

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards
