[@23f1002630](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002630) - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows an error encountered while attempting to load questions for an exam. The message "Error! Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange." is displayed, along with the specific error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')". This suggests a problem with accessing data related to question indexing, possibly indicating missing or improperly formatted data. A "Loading questions..." indicator suggests the process is stuck, and buttons "Check all" and "Save" are visible, implying interaction with question data. The interface prompts the user to contact the exam team for assistance.

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.

## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

Kindly check the question and the answer. I found below cities for São Paulo.

However, it says my answer is incorrect.

> How many units of Bacon were sold in São Paulo on transactions with at least 151 units?

```
city
Sao Paolo
Sao Paoulo
Sao Paulo
Sao Pualo
Sau Paulo
São Paulo


```



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data table with columns 'city', 'product', and 'sales'. The 'city' column has inconsistent spellings: "Sau Paulo", "Sao Pualo" and "Sao Paoulo". Filter icons are visible in the header row. The 'sales' column sums to 2871. The key issue appears to be data cleaning required in the city column to correct spelling errors.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

The objective is to determine the number of successful GET requests (status codes 200-299) for the `/telugu/` section of the website. The analysis should be performed on logs for May 2024, specifically Saturdays between the 13th and 23rd, within a 13:00 to 23:00 time window (GMT-0500 timezone).

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

> **Image:** The screenshot presents a case study concerning recovering sales data from OCR-processed receipts. The main task is to parse a JSON file ("q-parse-partial-json.jsonl") with 100 rows of sales data, extract the `sales` values from each row, and calculate the total sales. The provided JSON data is incomplete as the `id` field is often missing due to OCR issues. The challenge involves dealing with truncated data and focusing on extracting and summing the `sales` values.

The table contains columns for "Country (Normalised)", "DATE", "Product", "Sales", and "Cost". The "DATE" column contains dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYY. No specific code snippets or error messages are evident in this screenshot. The UI element "Sales" has a filter icon next to it.

| SUM OF COST | 14891.00 |
| --- | --- |
| SUM OF SALES | 31004.00 |
| TOTAL | 45895.00 |
| TOTAL MARGIN | 0.351083996 |

tried google sheets - it autoformatted my date data, also i realized later i was applying the formula the wrong way.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a table of data with columns: "Country (Normalised)", "DATE", "Product", "Sales", and "Cost". All entries listed are for the "United Arab Emirates" and the "Product" is consistently "Kappa". The dates range from 2022 to 2023, with corresponding numerical values for "Sales" and "Cost". The table has filter icons (funnel symbol) next to column names like "DATE", "Product", and "Cost". The "Country (Normalised)", "DATE", "Product", and "Sales" columns also have a check mark icon next to them, while "Cost" column has a filter type icon.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a data table with sales information. The table has three columns: "city," "product," and "sales." All entries in the visible portion of the table relate to "London" and "Computer," with varying numerical "sales" values. Dropdown icons next to each column header ("city," "product," "sales") suggest filtering or sorting functionality. The issue likely involves aggregating or analyzing these sales figures, possibly filtered or grouped by city and product.



How many units of Computer were sold in London on transactions with at least 39 units?  
please check my answer is not correct - (6193)

Respected [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine .  
To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.  
Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question.

Hi [@Algsoch](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/algsoch)  
I have checked your dataset along with your params, and its perfectly correct. Try again and check your step.

[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

```
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

```

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

[@lakshaygarg654](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/lakshaygarg654)

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

```
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

```

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the *outermost layer* so you have to continue extracting it from the *inner layers* of the nested query.

```
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

```

Then the final layer of the nest

```
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

```

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

[@daksh76](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

Thank you for your response [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton). You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

1. **`json_extract`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
2. **`json_each`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
3. **`json_extract_path_text`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract\_path\_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**.

Thankyou

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a data science problem related to cleaning and analyzing sales data.  The task is to calculate the total margin for "Theta" sales in the "US" before "Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530". The prompt provides instructions on handling inconsistent data formats for customer names, country codes, dates, and product names, as well as cleaning sales and cost data, including dealing with missing cost values by imputing 50% of the sales. The user's input "0.0" resulted in the error message "Error: Incorrect answer", suggesting an issue with the calculation or data filtering logic.  The task description includes a formula for Total Margin = (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales.



  
In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before **Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta** sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta**, there are no entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.

(I cross-checked this using GPT.)

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

```
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

```

What it does is for each post\_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post\_id. Finally returns all the post\_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

Question 9 might not be solved 100% automatically, Manually listen to audio once or twice and correct few things.

Kind regards

**Q9**

Note : I found that punctuations are also checked. So make sure you include punctuations inside the paragraph wherever it is effective according to the voice in the paragraph

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments? I understand that each set of students get different questions.
