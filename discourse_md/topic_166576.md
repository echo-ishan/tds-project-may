> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot, detailing the key information and transcribing relevant messages:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot appears to be from an online platform, likely an examination or assignment portal for a data science course, given the domain "ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

1.  **User Authentication:** The user is logged in, identified by the email address `23f1002630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. A "Logout" button is available.
2.  **Recent Activity/Scores:** There's a section for "Recent saves" which indicates "most recent is your official score." Currently, it shows "No recent saves," suggesting the user either hasn't attempted anything yet or no scores have been recorded/saved.
3.  **Attempt to Load Content:** The system was attempting to load questions, indicated by the "Loading questions..." message and a spinning progress icon.
4.  **Critical Error:** The primary issue highlighted is a prominent error message in a red box, indicating that the system failed to load the questions. This is a critical functional error preventing the user from proceeding.
5.  **Call to Action:** The user is instructed to contact the "exam team" for assistance, which is standard procedure for technical issues on such platforms.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Login Status:** `You are logged in as 23f1002630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`
*   **Button Text:** `Logout`
*   **Recent Saves Header:** `Recent saves (most recent is your official score)`
*   **Recent Saves Content:** `No recent saves`
*   **Loading Status:** `Loading questions...`
*   **Error Header:** `Error!`
*   **Error Message 1:** `Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange.`
*   **Error Message 2 (Specific):** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')`
*   **Instruction:** `Please contact the exam team for assistance.`*

[@23f1002630](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002630) - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online assessment or exam interface from a data science course that has encountered an error during the loading of questions.

### Key Information:

1.  **Assessment Context:** The interface appears to be for an exam or quiz, indicated by "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" and "Check all," "Save" buttons.
2.  **No Prior Attempts/Saves:** The "Recent saves" section explicitly states "No recent saves," implying the user has not successfully completed or saved any attempts on this particular assessment yet, or previous saves are not being displayed.
3.  **Loading Failure:** The primary issue is that the system attempted to load questions ("Loading questions...") but failed.
4.  **Specific Error Message:** A critical JavaScript-related error occurred: `cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')`. This typically means that the front-end code expected a variable or object to contain data (like an array of questions) but found it to be `undefined` (meaning it doesn't exist or is null), and then attempted to access a property or index (like `[1]` or `.1`) on it.
    *   **Implication:** This suggests a problem with the data being fetched from the server for the questions, or an issue with the client-side code's handling of an empty or malformed response.
5.  **User Action:** The system directs the user to "Please contact the exam team for assistance."
6.  **Interface State:** Despite the error, the "Check all" and "Save" buttons are visible at the bottom, though they are likely non-functional given that no questions have loaded.

### Transcribed Content:

*   **Recent saves (most recent is your official score)**
*   **No recent saves**
*   **Loading questions...**
*   **Error!**
*   **Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange.**
*   **cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')**
*   **Please contact the exam team for assistance.**
*   **Check all**
*   **Save***

## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

Kindly check the question and the answer. I found below cities for São Paulo.

However, it says my answer is incorrect.

> How many units of Bacon were sold in São Paulo on transactions with at least 151 units?

```
city
Sao Paolo
Sao Paoulo
Sao Paulo
Sao Pualo
Sau Paulo
São Paulo


```



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a spreadsheet (likely Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets) showing tabular data, potentially from a sales or inventory dataset.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Data Structure:** The data is organized into columns with headers:
    *   **A: city**
    *   **B: product**
    *   **C: sales**

2.  **Filtering Indication:**
    *   The row numbers are non-consecutive (e.g., 1, then 249, 1125, 1448, 1930, 2278). This strongly indicates that the data has been **filtered** or that many rows between these visible ones are hidden.
    *   Filter icons are visible next to the "product" and "sales" column headers, confirming that filters are applied or available.
    *   All visible entries in the "product" column are "Bacon", suggesting that the data is currently filtered to show only sales for "Bacon" products.

3.  **Data Content:**
    *   **City:** Shows variations in spelling for "Sao Paulo" (e.g., "Sau Paulo", "Sao Pualo", "Sao Paoulo", "Sao Paolo"). This points to a **data quality issue** requiring data cleaning (standardization).
    *   **Product:** Consistently "Bacon" for the visible rows, likely due to an active filter.
    *   **Sales:** Numeric values representing sales figures (e.g., 488, 522, 650).

4.  **Summary Statistic:**
    *   Cell **C2502** contains the value `2871`, which is bolded. This is located directly below the sales data and appears to be a **sum** or subtotal of the visible 'sales' values (488 + 522 + 650 + 275 + 936 = 2871). This reinforces that the data is filtered, and this sum applies to the filtered subset.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is no visible code, commands, or error messages in this screenshot. The content is purely a visual representation of data within a spreadsheet interface.*

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, presenting a case study or problem set for analyzing web server logs. The overall goal is to perform a "Peak Usage Analysis for Regional Content" on the `s-anand.net` website.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

---

**Overall Context:**

*   **Website:** `s-anand.net`, a personal website focusing on region-specific music content, with a key section being "telugu".
*   **Data Source:** Robust Apache web server access logs for May 2024, stored in a GZipped file (61MB), containing 258,074 rows.
*   **Problem:** The author noticed unusual traffic patterns during weekend evenings.
*   **Objective:** To determine the number of "successful GET requests" to the "telugu" section during peak hours on Saturdays.

**Specific Analysis Criteria (Initial Problem Statement):**

*   **Time Window:** From 13 until before 23.
*   **Request Type:** Only GET requests.
*   **Success Criteria:** Requests that return HTTP status codes between **200 and 299**.
*   **Data Source:** The logs for May 2024 stored in a GZipped Apache log file containing 258,074 rows.

**Log File Challenges & Formatting Nuances:**

*   **Timezone:** Logs are recorded in the GMT-0500 timezone.
*   **Field Separator:** Fields are separated by spaces.
*   **Quoting:** Most fields are quoted by double quotes (`"`), **except the Time field**.
*   **Escaping:** Unlike CSV, quoted fields are escaped via `\"` (backslash double-quote) and not `""` (double double-quote).
*   **Formatting Issues:** 41 rows have "unique quoting due to how quotes are escaped."

**Your Task (As a Data Analyst):**

*   Determine how many **successful GET requests** for pages under **telugu** were made on Saturdays between **13** and **23** during May 2024.
*   This metric will help:
    *   **Scale Resources:** Ensure servers can handle peak load.
    *   **Content Planning:** Determine popularity of regional content.
    *   **Marketing Insights:** Tailor promotional strategies.

**Apache Log File Field Definitions (transcribed exactly):**

Each row has these fields:

*   **IP**: The IP address of the visitor
*   **Remote logname**: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically "-"
*   **Remote user**: The remote user of the visitor. Typically "-"
*   **Time**: The time of the visit. E.g. **[01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]**. Not that **this is not quoted** and you need to handle this.
*   **Request**: The request made by the visitor. E.g. **GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1**. It has 3 space-separated parts, namely (a) **Method**: The HTTP method. E.g. **GET** (b) **URL**: The URL visited. E.g. **/blog/** (c) **Protocol**: The HTTP protocol. E.g. **HTTP/1.1**
*   **Status**: The HTTP status code. If **200 <= Status < 300** it is a successful request
*   **Size**: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. **1234**
*   **Referer**: The referer URL. E.g. **https://s-anand.net/**
*   **User agent**: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.
*   **Vhost**: The virtual host. E.g. **s-anand.net**
*   **Server**: The IP address of the server.

**Final Question (The specific prompt to answer):**

*   "What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under **/telugu/** from **13:00** until before **23:00** on Sundays?"

**Important Discrepancy Note:**

The initial problem description and "Your Task" section explicitly state the analysis should be for **Saturdays**. However, the final question asks for the analysis to be performed for **Sundays**. This is a crucial detail that a data analyst would need to clarify or account for.*

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot presents a "Case Study" from a data science course, focusing on a data recovery and processing challenge.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Case Study Title:**
*   "Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics"

**Problem Description:**
*   **Company:** ReceiptRevive Analytics, a data recovery and business intelligence firm.
*   **Specialty:** Processing legacy sales data from paper receipts.
*   **Method:** Digitize receipts using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques.
*   **Core Issue:** Due to damaged physical receipts (torn, faded, etc.), the OCR process often produces **incomplete JSON data**, leading to **truncated fields** or **missing values**.
*   **Client:** RetailFlow Inc., a major client with numerous brick-and-mortar stores and an extensive archive of old receipts.
*   **Client's Need:** Recover total sales information to analyze historical sales performance.
*   **Provided Data:** A JSON file containing **100 rows** of sales data.
*   **Expected Data Structure (per sales entry):**
    *   **city:** The city where the sale was made.
    *   **product:** The product that was sold.
    *   **sales:** The number of units sold (or sales revenue).
    *   **id:** A unique identifier for the receipt.
*   **Specific Data Impairment:** JSON entries are **truncated at the end**, and the **`id` field is missing** for some entries.
*   **Primary Interest:** Despite data imperfections, RetailFlow Inc. is primarily interested in the **aggregate sales value**.

**Your Task (as a data recovery analyst at ReceiptRevive Analytics):**
The goal is to develop a program to:

1.  **Parse the Sales Data:**
    *   Read the provided JSON file (100 rows).
    *   Accurately extract the `sales` figures from each row, even with truncated data and missing `id`s.
2.  **Data Validation and Cleanup:**
    *   Ensure proper handling of incomplete fields.
    *   Focus solely on the `sales` values given the missing `id`.
3.  **Calculate Total Sales:**
    *   Sum the `sales` values across all 100 rows.
    *   Provide a single aggregate figure representing total sales.

**Business Benefits of Successful Recovery:**
*   **Reconstruct Historical Sales Data:** Gain insights despite damaged original receipts.
*   **Inform Business Decisions:** Understand sales trends, adjust inventory, plan promotions.
*   **Enhance Data Recovery Processes:** Improve handling of imperfect OCR data, reduce future data loss.
*   **Build Client Trust:** Demonstrate ability to extract insights from challenging datasets.

**Data Download Command/File:**
The data required for this task can be downloaded from:
`q-parse-partial-json.jsonl`*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a dataset, likely from a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, given the column headers and filter icons. It appears to be raw or partially processed data used in a data science context, possibly for an exercise in data cleaning, analysis, or visualization.

### Key Information:

*   **Data Structure:** The data is presented in a tabular format with five columns.
*   **Column Headers:**
    *   `H`: **Country (Normalised)**
    *   `I`: **DATE**
    *   `J`: **Product**
    *   `K`: **Sales**
    *   `L`: **Cost**
*   **Filtering/Sorting:** All visible column headers (H, I, J, K, L) have filter dropdown arrows, indicating that the data can be sorted or filtered, or that a filter is currently applied.
*   **Data Content:**
    *   **Country (Normalised):** All visible entries are "United Arab Emirates". This suggests the data might be filtered to show only records from this country, or this is a specific subset provided for analysis. The "(Normalised)" suffix implies that country names have undergone a standardization process.
    *   **Product:** All visible entries are "Kappa". Similar to the country, this suggests filtering for a specific product or a product-focused dataset.
    *   **DATE:** Contains dates in mixed formats: some are `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2023-07-02`), while others are `MM-DD-YYYY` (e.g., `03-15-2023`, `11-17-2023`). This inconsistency is a common data cleaning challenge in data science.
    *   **Sales & Cost:** These columns contain numerical values, likely representing monetary amounts, formatted with two decimal places (e.g., `1314.00`, `4892.00`).

### Post #18 by **NamanBeri** (ds-students)
*February 15, 2025, 17:19 UTC*
tried google sheets - it autoformatted my date data, also i realized later i was applying the formula the wrong way.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a segment of a tabular dataset, likely from a spreadsheet program (like Excel or Google Sheets), a data visualization tool (like Power BI or Tableau), or a data frame output in a programming environment (like a Pandas DataFrame in Python or a data.table in R). It appears to be part of a sales or transaction record.

### Key Information:

1.  **Data Structure:** The image shows a table with a clear header row and six data rows. The rows alternate in color (light blue/white) for readability.
2.  **Column Headers:**
    *   `Country (Normalised)`: This column contains geographical information. The "(Normalised)" suffix suggests that the country names have undergone a standardization or cleaning process (e.g., converting "UAE" to "United Arab Emirates").
    *   `DATE`: This column holds date values in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    *   `Product`: This column identifies the product type.
    *   `Sales`: This column contains numerical values, likely representing sales amounts, formatted with two decimal places.
    *   `Cost`: This column contains numerical values, likely representing cost amounts, also formatted with two decimal places.
3.  **Filter Indicators:** All column headers (`Country (Normalised)`, `DATE`, `Product`, `Sales`, `Cost`) display a filter icon (a downward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line beneath it). This indicates that filtering and sorting capabilities are active for these columns, suggesting the user can manipulate the view of the data.
4.  **Observed Data Values:**
    *   **Country (Normalised):** All visible entries are "United Arab Emirates". This could mean the data has been filtered to show only this country, or this is a specific subset of data.
    *   **DATE:** Dates range from 2022 to 2023, and are not in chronological order in the current view.
        *   2023-02-07
        *   2022-06-29
        *   2023-02-04
        *   2022-11-10
        *   2022-06-04
        *   2023-01-15
    *   **Product:** All visible entries are "Kappa". Similar to the country, this suggests a filter might be applied, or this data subset exclusively pertains to the "Kappa" product.
    *   **Sales:** Varying numerical values:
        *   1314.00
        *   9370.00
        *   5488.00
        *   6307.00
        *   7810.00
        *   2029.00
    *   **Cost:** Varying numerical values:
        *   4892.00
        *   2214.00
        *   2744.00
        *   287.00
        *   4755.00
        *   4891.00
5.  **Context (Inferred):** Given the context of a "data science course forum," this screenshot likely illustrates:
    *   The result of a data loading operation.
    *   The state of data after initial cleaning or transformation (e.g., "Normalised" country).
    *   A filtered view of a larger dataset, possibly for analysis specific to "United Arab Emirates" and "Kappa" products.
    *   An example of data to be used for calculations (e.g., profit = Sales - Cost) or further analysis.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There is **no visible code, commands, or error messages** present in this screenshot. The image solely displays tabular data.*

> **Image Content:** *The image displays a partial view of a structured data table, typical of what might be found in a data analysis software, a spreadsheet application, or a web-based dashboard used in a data science context. It shows specific sales records.

### Key Information:

1.  **Data Structure:** The table has three clearly defined columns:
    *   **City:** Represents a geographical location where a sale occurred.
    *   **Product:** Represents the type of product sold.
    *   **Sales:** Represents the numerical value of a sale.

2.  **Interactive Elements:** Each column header (`_ _ _ - city`, `_ _ _ - product`, `_ _ _ - sales`) features a dropdown arrow icon, indicating that the table is interactive. This suggests capabilities for filtering, sorting, or potentially grouping the data based on these columns.

3.  **Filtered/Specific View:** All visible rows (10 in total) consistently show "London" for the `city` column and "Computer" for the `product` column. This strongly implies that the dataset displayed is either:
    *   A filtered view of a larger dataset, showing only sales related to "London" and the "Computer" product.
    *   A specific subset of data being analyzed or highlighted for discussion.

Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

```
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

```

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

[@lakshaygarg654](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/lakshaygarg654)

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

```
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

```

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the *outermost layer* so you have to continue extracting it from the *inner layers* of the nested query.

```
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

```

Then the final layer of the nest

```
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

```

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

[@daksh76](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

Thank you for your response [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton). You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

1. **`json_extract`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
2. **`json_each`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
3. **`json_extract_path_text`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract\_path\_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**.

Thankyou

> **Image Content:** *As an expert in analyzing screenshots from data science course forums, I must point out that **the provided image is not a screenshot from a data science course forum.**

Instead, it appears to be a highly abstract graphic, a simple icon, or perhaps a very small, blurry detail from a larger image.

Therefore, I cannot identify any key information relevant to a data science course forum, nor can I transcribe any code, commands, or error messages, as none are present.

**Key Information (Description of the image itself, not a forum):**

*   **Background:** Solid black.
*   **Foreground Elements:** Two blurry, bright yellow shapes.
    *   On the left: A larger, roughly circular or spherical shape.
    *   To the right of the larger shape: A smaller, elongated, somewhat rectangular or bullet-shaped form.
*   **Resolution/Clarity:** The image is very low resolution and the shapes are indistinct, appearing blurred or pixelated.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **None present.** There is no text or symbolic information that resembles code, commands, or error messages.*

**Key Information:**

The image is a full-screen black background with a single, minimalist graphic element in the center.

*   **Content:** A bright yellow icon or symbol.
*   **Composition of the Icon:** It consists of two conjoined shapes:
    *   A perfect circle on the left.
    *   A smaller, horizontally elongated shape with rounded ends (resembling a "pill" or a short, thick line) attached to the right side of the circle.
*   **Contextual Absence:** Crucially, there is no visible text, code, commands, error messages, user interface elements (such as forum posts, navigation bars, buttons, or input fields), or any other typical content expected from a data science course forum screenshot. This suggests the image might be:
    *   A loading animation or spinner.
    *   A minimalistic logo or branding element.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, detailing a practical data cleaning and analysis exercise.

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The exercise is titled "Improving Sales Data Accuracy for RetailWise Inc." It describes a scenario where RetailWise Inc., a retail analytics firm, receives messy sales data from scanned receipts in an Excel file containing 1,000 transaction records.
*   **Problem Statement (Messy Data Columns):**
    *   **Customer Name:** Contains leading/trailing spaces.
    *   **Country:** Inconsistent representations (e.g., "USA", "US", "U.K", "Fra", "Bra", "Ind" instead of standardized 2-letter abbreviations).
    *   **Date:** Mixed date formats (e.g., "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY/MM/DD").
    *   **Product:** Contains product name followed by a slash and a random code (e.g., "Theta/5x01vd"); only the product name part (before the slash) is relevant.
    *   **Sales and Cost:** Contain extra spaces and currency string ("USD"). The Cost field is sometimes missing; if so, it should be treated as 50% of the Sales value.
    *   **TransactionID:** May have inconsistent spacing.
*   **Your Task (Overall Goal):** Clean the Excel data and calculate the total margin for transactions meeting specific criteria:
    *   **Time Filter:** Sales up to and including **Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)**.
    *   **Product Filter:** Product is **Theta** (using only the product name before the slash).
    *   **Country Filter:** Country is **US** (after standardizing country names).
*   **Margin Definition:**
    `Total Margin = (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales`
*   **Detailed Challenges/Steps for Solution:**
    1.  **Trim and Normalize Strings:** Remove extra spaces from Customer Name and Country fields. Map inconsistent country names to a standardized format.
    2.  **Standardize Date Formats:** Detect and convert dates from "MM-DD-YYYY" and "YYYY/MM/DD" to a consistent ISO 8601 format.
    3.  **Extract the Product Name:** From the Product field, extract the part before the slash.
    4.  **Clean and Convert Sales and Cost:** Remove "USD" text and extra spaces. Convert to numerical values. Handle missing Cost values by setting them to 50% of Sales.
    5.  **Filter the Data:** Apply the time, product (Theta), and country (US) filters.
    6.  **Calculate the Margin:** Sum Sales and Cost for filtered transactions and compute the overall margin using the provided formula.
*   **Benefits of Cleaning (for RetailWise Inc.):** Improve Decision Making, Enhance Reporting, Streamline Operations.
*   **Required Input File:** The student needs to download an Excel file to perform the analysis.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Download File Link:** `q-clean-up-excel-sales-data.xlsx`
*   **Question Text:** `What is the total margin for transactions before Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in US (which may be spelt in different ways)?`
*   **User's Submitted Answer:** `0.0`
*   **Error Message:** `Error: Incorrect answer`
*   **Hint/Instruction below error:** `You can enter the margin as a percentage (e.g. 12.34%) or a decimal (e.g. 0.1234).`*



  
In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before **Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta** sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta**, there are no entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.

(I cross-checked this using GPT.)

> **Image Content:** *Based on the analysis of the provided image and its crops, here's a description of the key information, along with any transcribable text:

**Overall Assessment:**
The image is an artistic, AI-generated collage or montage, rather than a literal screenshot from a data science course forum. It visually conveys themes related to data science, technology, human expertise, and learning through a combination of steampunk-esque technical drawings, abstract diagrams, and human portraits. The textual elements are largely non-sensical, garbled, or placeholder text, characteristic of AI-generated images where text generation is not the primary focus or well-executed. Therefore, there is no actionable "forum content" in terms of user questions, answers, specific code, or error messages.

**Key Information & Thematic Elements:**

1.  **Technological & Data Focus:**
    *   **Gears and Cogs:** Prominently featured throughout, symbolizing mechanical processes, intricate systems, and perhaps the "inner workings" of data analysis or machine learning algorithms.
    *   **Circuit-like Lines and Diagrams:** Suggest connections, data flow, and complex computational networks.
    *   **Bar Charts:** Appear in several sections (e.g., top-middle, middle-left), representing data visualization and analysis.
    *   **Globes:** Suggest global data, reach, or the widespread application of data science.
    *   **Buildings/Cityscapes (Middle Left):** Could symbolize infrastructure, data centers, or the real-world application of technology.

2.  **Human Expertise & Learning:**
    *   **Male Portraits:** Multiple stylized portraits of men appear, often in professional attire (suits, a uniform, a graduation cap). This emphasizes the human element in data science, the role of experts, learners, and professionals.
    *   **Graduation Cap (Lower Middle):** Clearly visible on one portrait, reinforcing the theme of education, training, and achieving qualifications in data science.
    *   **Close-ups of Eyes and Hair:** Suggest focus, deep thought, and the intellectual aspect of the field.

3.  **Abstract & Diagrammatic Elements:**
    *   Various boxes, lines, and flow-chart like structures are present, implying processes, logical steps, or system architectures relevant to data science methodologies.

**Transcribed Text (Exact as Appears, Note on Legibility):**

It's important to note that much of the text is illegible or appears as nonsensical character strings, which is common in AI-generated imagery not specifically designed for accurate text rendering. I will transcribe only what is clearly discernible, even if it doesn't form coherent words or sentences.

*   **Top Left (under man's portrait):**
    ```
    UTXCY WOLO
    ```
*   **Top Middle (various boxes):**
    ```
    HIAGGE
    WIERL
    ID DIOMNIDRNTN
    ```
    (Below these, there are many lines of text that are completely garbled and unreadable, appearing as random characters or faded squiggles.)
*   **Middle Left (banner above buildings):**
    ```
    BACKGROUND PROFILE ERANING
    ```
    (Note: "ERANING" is likely a corruption of "TRAINING" or "SCANNING," implying a professional or educational context.)
*   **Middle Left (box below banner):**
    ```
    TANNIMI
    ```
*   **Middle Right (large text block):**
    ```
    AODIDM EXTERIENEG
    ```
    (Below this, text within a document-like graphic is completely illegible.)
*   **Lower Middle (above man in uniform portrait):**
    ```
    A SUTTICAE
    ```
    (Other text in this section is completely illegible.)
*   **Bottom Left (below gears):**
    ```
    OMMIDOMNIE DALUDAI - CO
    IBINL GHETEUIRNGA - Q
    ```
*   **Bottom Right (top banner):**
    ```
    JENGTEBROGRAND
    ```
    (Below this, text within a document-like graphic is completely illegible.)

**Conclusion regarding Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are **no recognizable code snippets, command-line instructions, or error messages** present in the image. All discernible text is either a corrupted word, a nonsensical string of characters, or simply illegible placeholder text.*

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

```
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

```

What it does is for each post\_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post\_id. Finally returns all the post\_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

> **Image Content:** *As an expert in analyzing data science course forum screenshots, here's a detailed breakdown of the key information presented in the image:

---

**Screenshot Analysis: IIT Madras Online Degree - Data Preparation Graded Assignment**

This screenshot displays an online graded assignment interface from the "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation" course, likely part of the IIT Madras Online Degree program. The user is attempting to answer a question related to web server log analysis.

**1. Assignment Context & Status:**
*   **Course:** TDS 2025 Jan (Data Preparation - Graded Assignment 5).
*   **Platform:** An online examination system, indicated by the URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5`.
*   **Time Remaining:** `11:35:28 left`, indicating a substantial amount of time remaining for the assignment.
*   **Score:** `Score: 0 / 10`, implying the current attempt is incorrect or no points have been awarded yet.
*   **Actions:** "Check all" and "Save" buttons are visible, suggesting the user can submit and save progress.

**2. Data Description & Log Field Definitions:**
The assignment provides a comprehensive description of the web server log format, which is crucial for understanding the data to be analyzed.

*   **Request:**
    *   "The request made by the visitor. E.g. `GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1`."
    *   "It has 3 space-separated parts, namely (a) **Method**: The HTTP method. E.g. `GET` (b) **URL**: The URL visited. E.g. `/blog/` (c) **Protocol**: The HTTP protocol. E.g. `HTTP/1.1`"
*   **Status:**
    *   "The HTTP status code. If `200 <= Status < 300` it is a successful request" (This is a key definition for filtering).
*   **Size:**
    *   "The size of the response in bytes. E.g. `1234`"
*   **Referer:**
    *   "The referer URL. E.g. `https://s-anand.net/`"
*   **User agent:**
    *   "The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes."
*   **Vhost:**
    *   "The virtual host. E.g. `s-anand.net`"
*   **Server:**
    *   "The IP address of the server."

**3. Data Formatting and Peculiarities:**
Important notes on how the log data is structured:
*   "The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (`"`)."
*   "Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via `\` and not `""`." (This specifically mentions an impact on `41 rows`, highlighting a potential parsing challenge).
*   **Timezone:** "All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone and the questions are based in this same timezone." (Crucial for time-based filtering).

**4. Business Objectives / Why Log Analysis Matters:**
The assignment outlines the practical applications of performing such analysis:
*   **Optimize Infrastructure:** "Scale server resources effectively during peak traffic times, reducing downtime and improving user experience."
*   **Strategize Content Delivery:** "Identify popular content segments and adjust digital content strategies to better serve the audience."
*   **Improve Marketing Efforts:** "Focus marketing initiatives on peak usage windows to maximize engagement and conversion."

**5. The Problem/Question:**
The core task presented to the user:
*   **Question Text:** "What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under `/malayalammp3/` from **10:00** until before **17:00** on **Saturdays**?"

**6. User's Attempt and Error Message:**
*   **User's Answer (Input Field):** `2316`
*   **Error Message:** `Error: Incorrect answer`

**Summary of the Problem:**

The user is tasked with analyzing a web server log dataset (not provided in the screenshot, but implied) to count specific requests. The criteria for counting are:
1.  **Method:** Must be `GET`.
2.  **Status:** Must be "successful" (`200 <= Status < 300`).
3.  **URL Path:** Must start with `/malayalammp3/`.
4.  **Day of Week:** Must be a Saturday.
5.  **Time of Day:** Must be between 10:00 (inclusive) and 17:00 (exclusive).
6.  **Timezone:** All operations are to be performed in GMT-0500.

The user has submitted `2316` as their answer, which the system has marked as incorrect. This suggests a potential miscalculation, an error in applying one or more of the filtering criteria, or an issue with parsing the log data, especially concerning the escaped quotes or time/day calculations.*



  
after trying python codes chatgpt i tried using linux commands  
bash-5.2$ zgrep ‘GET /malayalammp3/’ s-anand.net-May-2024.gz   
| grep -E ‘[(04|11|18|25)/May/2024:(10|11|12|13|14|15|16):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]’   
| grep -E ’ “(GET|POST) .\* HTTP/1.[01]” (2[0-9][0-9]) ’ | wc -l  
2316  
i’m getting 2316 but when i enter in the answer box it says incorrect

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online assessment or quiz page for a data science course, likely part of an academic program. It appears to be set in a dark mode theme.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assessment Header & Status:**
*   **End Date/Time:** "Ended at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" - This indicates the deadline for the assessment has passed.
*   **Current Score (Header):** "Score: 0" - This is the score displayed prominently at the top.
*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   "Check all" - A button to check answers.
    *   "Save" - A button to save progress.

**2. Course & Assignment Title:**
*   **Title:** "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data H" (The "H" is cut off, possibly "Data Handling" or "Data Science").
    *   "TDS" likely refers to "The Data Science" program or similar.
    *   "2025 Jan" indicates the batch or semester.
    *   "GA5" probably stands for "Graded Assignment 5" or "General Assignment 5."

**3. Instructions:**
A numbered list provides guidelines for taking the quiz. Some sentences are cut off due to the screenshot's boundaries.

1.  "Learn what you need. Reading material is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the"
2.  "Check answers regularly by pressing Check. It shows which answers are right or wrong. You c"
3.  "Save regularly by pressing Save. You can save multiple times. Your last saved submission will b"
4.  "Reloading is OK. Your answers are saved in your browser (not server). Questions won't change c"
5.  "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different"
6.  "Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. U"
7.  "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz"

**4. Discussion/Support:**
*   A section prompting users to ask questions: "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse"
*   **Command/Link:** "Join the discussion on Discourse"

**5. User Information:**
*   **Logged-in User:** "You are logged in as 23f1002709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." - This is the user's specific identifier for the course platform.
*   **Action Button:** "Logout" - A button to log out of the session.

**6. Recent Saves:**
*   **Heading:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
*   **Saved Submissions (Commands/Information):**
    *   "Reload from 2/21/2025, 4:40:22 PM. Score: 10" (Most recent save, indicated as the official score)
    *   "Reload from 2/21/2025, 4:40:20 PM. Score: 10"
    *   "Reload from 2/21/2025, 4:40:14 PM. Score: 10"
    *   The "Reload" text appears to be a clickable command/button for each entry, allowing the user to revert to an earlier save.

**Key Observations/Discrepancies:**
*   The header shows "Score: 0", but the "Recent saves" section indicates the most recent official score is "10". This could mean the "Score: 0" at the top is a default or placeholder for the final submitted grade, while the "Recent saves" reflects the score achieved during ongoing work or a local calculation.
*   The instructions mention answers being saved "in your browser (not server)," implying client-side saving, which is unusual for formal assessments but aligns with the "Reloading is OK" instruction.
*   Instruction #7, "It's hackable," is highly unusual for an official course assessment and suggests a unique challenge or an emphasis on understanding system vulnerabilities.*



  
recent score shows the points, but overall score is 0. Please take a look.

Thanks and kind regards
