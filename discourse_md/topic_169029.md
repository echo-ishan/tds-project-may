If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?

If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a description of the key information presented:

**Key Information Description:**

This screenshot displays instructions related to the **deployment of an application** within a data science course. The main objective is for the user to make their developed application publicly accessible on the internet.

*   **Task/Goal:** The primary instruction is to "Deploy your application."
*   **Access Requirement:** The application must be deployed to a "public URL that can be accessed by anyone." This emphasizes the need for the application to be discoverable and usable by a general audience, rather than just locally or within a private network.
*   **Platform Flexibility:** The course allows for flexibility in choosing a deployment platform. Users "may use any platform."
*   **Platform Suggestion:** "Vercel" is explicitly mentioned as an example of a suitable platform. This provides a concrete suggestion for students who might be unsure which service to use for deployment. Vercel is a popular choice for static sites, serverless functions, and frontend applications, implying the application being deployed might fall into one of these categories.

In summary, these are clear instructions for students to take their finished or in-progress data science application (which could be a web app, an API, or a dashboard) and make it live and available for public access, with a suggestion of a specific service to help them do so.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code blocks, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The text displayed is instructional content.

Here is the exact transcription of the visible text:

Deploy your application
---
Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.*



  
Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hi [@24f2006531](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24f2006531)

You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)

There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).  
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:  
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?

Some other doubts are

1. Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
2. Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
3. Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
4. Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)

How do we account for this? [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.

1. Are we supposed to use OpenAI api‚Äôs or locally/private hosted one?
2. Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
3. Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
4. If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
5. Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?

awaiting a response.

Dear Sir,  
I have few questions. It is written in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2) that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don‚Äôt think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.

1. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.  
   But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
2. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?  
   Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.
3. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.
4. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?
5. Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?
6. And many more

Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.  
Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.

Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24\*7 during evaluation.

I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.

Also, some ques requires external toolings like

1. In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.
2. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?
3. GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can‚Äôt be installed locally.

How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.

Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like

1. In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI.
2. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?

Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API\_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev> will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.

Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that‚Äôs sufficient validation.

If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,  
Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

Hello Sir,

I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.

1. Currently answers that we have entered for GA‚Äôs 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we‚Äôve entered as well for verification purposes.
2. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.
3. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence\_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?
4. How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

What does it mean to solve the question?  
Everyone is asking that?  
Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?  
Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

‚Äúand responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.‚Äù  
From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered‚Ä¶ For example it states in the project that   
" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"  
If you all still have not responded, then I‚Äôm honestly not sure if this is what y‚Äôall meant.  
Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.

I understand that y‚Äôall want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don‚Äôt what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I‚Äôm curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll spend most of your time, so make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you‚Äôll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:

* Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
* Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
* Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
* Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
* Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
* Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
* Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
* Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)

## AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor

Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer‚Äôs toolkit. Please make sure to use them.

To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s`, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

What is the output of `code -s`? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user‚Äôs system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.

As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online "Assignment Helper" tool designed for students of the IIT Madras Data Science program. The tool allows users to input a question related to their graded assignments and receive an answer, likely a code snippet or solution.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Application Identity and Purpose:**
*   **Title:** IIT Madras Assignment Helper
*   **Description:** "Welcome to the Assignment Helper! This tool helps you find answers to IIT Madras Data Science graded assignment questions."
*   **Context:** This is a specialized tool for an academic data science course, suggesting the type of questions and answers will be technical and assignment-specific.

**2. "Ask a Question" Section:**
*   **Input Field (Question Text Area):** Contains a specific problem statement related to data querying.
    *   **Transcribed Question:**
        ```
        of high-performing posts.
        Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z with at least 1 comment with 5
        useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id, and the relevant post
        IDs should be sorted in ascending order.
        Check the console for the result of your your query.
        ```
*   **File Upload (Optional):**
    *   Label: "Upload assignment file (optional):"
    *   Button: "Choose File"
    *   Status: "No file chosen"
    *   This indicates users can provide additional context or their own work for the helper.
*   **Action Button:** "Get Answer" (A green button to submit the question and retrieve the solution).

**3. "Answer" Section:**
*   **Label:** "Answer:"
*   **Content (DuckDB SQL Query):** A DuckDB SQL query is provided as the solution to the posed question. This query aims to select `post_id` from a `social_media` table based on timestamp, and the existence of comments meeting specific criteria (at least 5 "useful stars").
    *   **Transcribed Code/Command:**
        ```sql
        SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(
        SELECT 1 FROM json_each(comments) WHERE json_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5 ) ORDER BY
        post_id;
        ```
    *   **Analysis of the Answer Query:**
        *   `SELECT post_id FROM social_media`: Selects the post IDs from a table named `social_media`.
        *   `WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z`: Filters posts published after a specific timestamp.
        *   `AND EXISTS(...)`: Ensures that the post has at least one comment meeting the nested condition.
        *   `SELECT 1 FROM json_each(comments)`: Iterates over elements within a `comments` JSON array column. `json_each` is a common DuckDB function for this purpose.
        *   `WHERE json_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5`: Extracts the `useful` field from `stars` within each comment's JSON `value`, casts it to an integer, and checks if it's greater than 5.
        *   `ORDER BY post_id;`: Sorts the final result by `post_id` in ascending order, as requested in the problem.

This tool functions as an automated solution provider for specific SQL querying tasks within a data science curriculum, specifically leveraging DuckDB's JSON processing capabilities.*

and this is also working with simple question  


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a command-line interface (CLI) session where a user is interacting with an API endpoint using the `curl` command.

1.  **Purpose:** The user is testing a simple question-answering API.
2.  **API Endpoint:** The API is hosted on Vercel, specifically at `https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/`. The URL structure suggests it might be a development or preview deployment of a project by "vicky-kumars."
3.  **Request Type:** A `POST` request is being made, which is typical for sending data to an API (in this case, a question).
4.  **Input Data:** The question "What is 2+2?" is being sent to the API using the `-F` flag (form data) with the field name "question".
5.  **API Response:** The API successfully processed the request and returned a JSON object: `{"answer": "4"}`. This indicates the API correctly calculated the answer to the mathematical question.
6.  **Context:** This is likely part of a lesson or exercise demonstrating how to interact with web APIs from the command line, possibly related to building or consuming simple AI/ML-powered services (like a chatbot or a basic calculator API). The success of the command implies proper setup and functionality of the API.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

```
D:\Yantravid>curl -X POST "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/" -F "question=What is 2+2?"
{"answer": "4"}

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, followed by a precise transcription.

---

### Key Information

1.  **Context:** The screenshot displays a command-line interaction, likely from a Windows environment (indicated by `D:\` path and `^` for line continuation). It appears to be part of a data science or programming challenge, possibly hosted on an online forum or platform.

2.  **Tool Used:** The `curl` command-line tool is being used to interact with a web API.

3.  **API Endpoint:** The target API endpoint is `https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/`. This is a Vercel-hosted application API.

4.  **Challenge/Task Description:**
    *   A `POST` request is sent to the API with a "question" field.
    *   The "question" details a multi-step file manipulation task:
        1.  "Download `qmove.zip` and extract it." (This implies the user is expected to obtain this file).
        2.  "Use `mv` to move all files under folders into an empty folder." (Consolidate files from a possibly nested directory structure).
        3.  "Then rename all files replacing each digit with the next. 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, a1b9c.txt becomes a2b0c.txt." (A specific digit-shifting renaming rule).
        4.  The final desired output is the result of running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in a Bash environment on the folder containing the processed files.

5.  **User Action/Submission:**
    *   Following the "question," another `curl -F` argument is present: `-F "file=@D:\Yantravid\yantravid\test_data\qmove.zip"`.
    *   This indicates the user is sending (uploading) the `qmove.zip` file (likely the *original* one they downloaded as per the instruction) to the API.

6.  **API Response/Verification:**
    *   The output of the `curl` command is a JSON object: `{"answer":"text\ne086115d65479e856262a61e17e4568880561732b2d6e81117e041681883191"}`.
    *   This JSON contains an "answer" field. The value is `text\n` followed by a long hexadecimal string. This hexadecimal string is very likely the `sha256sum` that the user *should* obtain if they correctly follow all the file manipulation steps outlined in the "question" on the `qmove.zip` file. The `text\n` prefix is a common artifact of `sha256sum`'s output format when no filename is provided after piping.
    *   This suggests the API is verifying the user's understanding and execution of the task by processing the `qmove.zip` itself and providing the expected `sha256sum` for comparison.

Sir, for GA-5 question number 3 the file is too large to send via request to vercel  
possible solution is uploading on google drive or smth like that but how will u guys send such long files plus the project only mention sending files not url ‚Ä¶Kindly clarify regarding this.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum describes the specifications for an API endpoint.

---

### Key Information:

The image details the requirements for interacting with a specific API endpoint.

1.  **API Endpoint Identification:** An application has an API endpoint, which is provided with an example URL.
2.  **HTTP Method:** The endpoint is required to accept HTTP POST requests.
3.  **Request Body Content:** The POST request body must include:
    *   "the question" (implying a text or string payload).
    *   Optional file attachments.
4.  **Content Type:** The request body, including both the "question" and any file attachments, must be encoded using `multipart/form-data`. This is a common content type for submitting forms that include files via HTTP.

In essence, it's instructing users on how to make a POST request to a given API endpoint, specifying the URL, the HTTP method, and the expected format and content of the request body, particularly emphasizing the use of `multipart/form-data` for handling both text data ("the question") and potential file uploads.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`*



  
Here, the questions entered after the endpoint will be exactly same as the GAs or be similar as the GAs ??

My Approach , is to

1. scrape and parse all the current question
2. create embeddings , of the questions.
3. create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
4. segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
5. Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy  
   to deploy a server and return an url

Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally, to check for the accuracy of solving the question.

1. I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
2. Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)  
   Thanks!

Does anyone willing to work with me..?

The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.

1. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
2. Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
3. Give the answer back as specified.

Kind regards

> You do not need to do the task as the GA required.

Does this mean this type of question won‚Äôt be paramaterized?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a set of instructions and a question from what appears to be an online data science course or forum, guiding a user through a command-line interaction related to Visual Studio Code.

### Key Information:

1.  **Context:** The instructions are part of a setup or verification step for a data science environment, specifically involving Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2.  **Objective:** The user is being asked to:
    *   Install and launch Visual Studio Code.
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Execute a specific command: `code -s`.
    *   Capture the entire output generated by this command.
    *   Paste that output as the answer to the subsequent question.
3.  **Command Purpose (Inferred):** The command `code -s` (where `code` is the executable for VS Code) is being used. The `-s` flag often stands for "status" or "system info" in command-line tools, suggesting it's intended to display information about the VS Code installation or environment variables, potentially to verify its correct setup on the system's PATH.
4.  **Assessment:** The prompt serves as a practical exercise to confirm the user's ability to install software, interact with their system's command line, and retrieve command output.

### Transcription:

**Instructions:**
Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or Command Prompt), type `code -s` and press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

**Question:**
What is the output of `code -s`?

**Code/Commands:**
*   `code -s`
*   `code -s`*



Like instead of `code -s` there won‚Äôt be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won‚Äôt be part of evaluation at all?

The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive online learning module, likely part of a data science course, focusing on practical application of spreadsheet formulas in both Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. The module presents two distinct exercises, each requiring the user to execute a provided formula in the respective software and then input the calculated result.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Structure:**
The interface features a dark theme, commonly seen in coding environments or modern learning platforms. It's divided into two main sections, each representing a separate exercise with a question, an input field for the answer, and a "Check" button.

---

**Section 1: Google Sheets Formula Exercise**

*   **Context/Instruction:** "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel)"
    *   This clearly indicates an exercise specifically for Google Sheets, emphasizing that the formula is not cross-compatible with Excel.
*   **Formula to Transcribe/Execute:**
    ```
    =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))
    ```
    *   **Explanation:** This Google Sheets formula performs the following operations:
        1.  `SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6)`: Generates a 100x100 array of numbers, starting at 15 and incrementing by 6.
        2.  `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(..., 1, 10)`: Constrains the large sequence array to only the first 1 row and 10 columns, effectively taking the first 10 numbers generated by `SEQUENCE`.
        3.  `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these first 10 numbers.
*   **Question:** "What is the result?"
    *   The user is expected to compute the sum and enter it into the provided input field.
*   **Interaction:** An empty input field followed by a "Check" button, suggesting an immediate validation of the user's answer.

---

**Section 2: Excel Formula Exercise**

*   **Exercise Title/Points:** "5 Use Excel (0.25 marks)"
    *   This marks the second exercise, specifically for Excel, and indicates it is question number 5, worth 0.25 marks.
*   **Compatibility Note:** "Note: This will ONLY work in Office 365."
    *   This is a crucial warning, indicating that the formulas used (`SORTBY`, `TAKE`) are dynamic array functions, which are only available in Microsoft 365 (subscription-based) versions of Excel, not older perpetual license versions.
*   **Formula to Transcribe/Execute:**
    ```
    =SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))
    ```
    *   **Explanation:** This Excel formula performs the following operations:
        1.  `{3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14}`: An array constant representing the data to be sorted.
        2.  `{10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}`: An array constant used as the sorting key (or "by_array") for the `SORTBY` function.
        3.  `SORTBY(data_array, sort_by_array)`: Sorts the first array (`{3,...}`) based on the corresponding values in the second array (`{10,...}`). The lowest value in the `sort_by_array` will bring its corresponding element from the `data_array` to the beginning of the sorted result.
        4.  `TAKE(sorted_array, 1, 9)`: Extracts a sub-array from the result of `SORTBY`. It takes 1 row and 9 columns (i.e., the first 9 elements) from the sorted array.
        5.  `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these 9 elements extracted by `TAKE`.
*   **Question:** "What is the result?"
    *   The user is expected to compute the sum and enter it into the provided input field.
*   **Error Message/Troubleshooting Note:** "Note: If you get #NAME? you have the wrong version of Excel. Find a friend for whom this works."
    *   This provides direct troubleshooting for a common error (`#NAME?`) which occurs when Excel doesn't recognize a function (in this case, `SORTBY` or `TAKE`) because it's not supported by the current Excel version. It also offers a practical solution: collaborate with someone who has the correct software version.
*   **Interaction:** An empty input field followed by a "Check" button, similar to the Google Sheets section.

In summary, the screenshot depicts an interactive assessment designed to test a user's ability to correctly use advanced spreadsheet formulas, specifically highlighting the differences and version dependencies between Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel (Office 365).*



A bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks in advance.

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer

Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.

The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.

I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!

For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.

What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.

The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.

A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.

etc.

> **Image Content:** *The image displays a stylized icon of a pushpin (or thumbtack).

**Key Information:**

*   **Object:** A pushpin/thumbtack.
*   **Colors:** The head of the pin is a vibrant red, and the pin itself is a light blue/grey. The background is a solid, dark green.
*   **Stylization:** The icon has a soft, slightly cartoonish appearance with smoothed edges, rather than a photo-realistic look.
*   **Contextual Meaning (Data Science Course Forum):** In the context of an online forum, particularly for an educational course, a pushpin icon almost universally signifies a "sticky" or "pinned" thread.
    *   **Purpose:** Pinned threads are posts that are considered important enough to remain at the very top of a forum section, regardless of when they were last active. This ensures that critical information is always easily accessible to users.
    *   **Common Use Cases:** For a data science course, a pinned thread might contain:
        *   Course announcements
        *   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
        *   Project guidelines or submission instructions
        *   Important policy updates
        *   Common error resolutions or debugging tips
        *   Links to essential resources (e.g., specific libraries, documentation)

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is no code, command, or error message visible within this image. The image is solely an icon.*

my small piece of code to evaluate the GA number parsing, it may be useful for some

```

Hi TAs,

I attended the meet which happened today. But I don‚Äôt clearly get one thing.

Most of the questions have a **question text** and a **file: csv,zip,json,etc**

My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"

```

Hi [@23f2000573](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000573)

Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.

You can send a file from local machine like this `-F "file=@abcd.zip"` so here `abcd.zip` must be in current working directory.

Kind regards

### Post #68 by **B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA** (ds-students)
*March 20, 2025, 05:37 UTC*
Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn‚Äôt need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.

## FILES

The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requester‚Äôs** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>

This link was take from GA2 Question 2

## HTML AND TABLE

Some questions have `html` and `tables`. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.

Example for string. Consider the table

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 |

Will this be something like this

```
"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"

```

or something like

```
"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"

```

## HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS

In one question, there were two tasks.

* Find the answer to the question
* Enable the `disabled` text block

In this question, what will the answer type be?

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

## MORE THAN ONE FILE

Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp> and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 

```

## CORS HEADERS

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

Hi,  
In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.

```
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')

```

Is this the code for others as well?  
Thanks

So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:

‚Üí the set of question-answers pairs at first  
‚Üí All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions  
‚Üí Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.

Till now I have created the following:

‚Üí Identification of the question, using embeddings  
‚Üí extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question  
‚Üí Implementation of 3 questions using this approach

If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.

\*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

23f2000573:

> ```
> "<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
>
> ```

This is correct html table format.

23f2000573:

> Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

It will be just answer.

23f2000573:

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

23f2000573:

> Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

Jivraj:

> file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click ‚Üí download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>.

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

Will it be

* ‚Äúfile=binary of zipfile/csv/json‚Äù for the first type and
* ‚Äúfile=<https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>‚Äù for the second type

Jivraj:

> This is correct html table format.

Will this table be in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute of curl or ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute

Jivraj:

> In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute and the image in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute?

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get‚Äôs downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester‚Äôs machine.

23f2000573:

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it‚Äôs a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it‚Äôs markdown table then it can be identified with `|` characters.

For GA 1, question 2  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an interactive exercise or problem set within a data science course, focusing on making HTTP requests and understanding JSON responses.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Topic:** The exercise is about using command-line tools to interact with web services, specifically making HTTPS GET requests and parsing their JSON output.
2.  **Tools Introduced:**
    *   `uv run`: A tool (likely a Python package runner/installer) used to execute commands with specified Python packages.
    *   `httppie`: A command-line HTTP client (similar to `curl` but more user-friendly) used to send HTTP/HTTPS requests.
3.  **Core Task:** The user is instructed to send an HTTPS GET request to `https://httpbin.org/get`.
4.  **Request Parameters:** The request must include a URL-encoded parameter named `email` with the specific value `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
5.  **Expected Output:** The goal is to obtain the JSON output of this command.
6.  **Specific Instruction for Output:** The user must paste only the "JSON body, not the headers." This implies that the full response might include HTTP headers, but only the JSON payload is required for the answer.
7.  **Provided (Partial) Answer:** The input field shows a partial JSON object, likely the expected or a user's attempted answer, which correctly includes the `args` section with the `email` parameter and the beginning of the `headers` section.
8.  **Interface Elements:** There's a "Check" button, indicating this is an interactive validation step.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exact Appearance):**

*   **Instructional Text (Top):**
    ```
    Running uv run --with httppie -- https [URL] installs the Python package httppie and sends a HTTPS request to the URL.
    ```
*   **Instructional Text (Middle):**
    ```
    Send a HTTPS request to https://httpbin.org/get with the URL encoded parameter email set to 21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    ```
*   **Question:**
    ```
    What is the JSON output of the command? (Paste only the JSON body, not the headers)
    ```
*   **Content of the Input Field (Partial JSON output):**
    ```json
    { "args": { "email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" }, "headers": { "Accept": "*/*", "Accept-Encodir
    ```*



  
The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using `\"` inside the answer like this.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a console or terminal output, likely from a programming environment used in a data science course (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, IDE terminal, or a command-line interface).

### Key Information:

1.  **Data Structure:** The output is a JSON object with a single key: `"answer"`.
2.  **Escaped JSON String:** The value associated with `"answer"` is a **string** that *itself* contains a heavily escaped JSON object. This means the original JSON content (the value of `answer`) was serialized into a string, which then required its internal quotes to be escaped with backslashes (`\`). This is a common pattern when JSON data is embedded within another JSON field as a string.
3.  **Contents of the Inner JSON (after unescaping):**
    *   **`"args": {}`**: An empty JSON object for arguments. In the context of an HTTP request, this typically indicates that no query parameters were sent.
    *   **`"email": "21f2007090@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"`**: This is a specific email address, likely a student ID from the `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` domain, which refers to the online degree program in Data Science offered by IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras). This strongly suggests the context is a student working on an assignment or practice problem related to this course.
    *   **`"headers": { ... }`**: This dictionary contains various HTTP request headers that were sent:
        *   **`"Accept": "*/*"`**: Indicates that the client accepts any media type in response.
        *   **`"Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate"`**: Specifies that the client prefers compressed responses (using gzip or deflate algorithms).
        *   **`"Host": "httpbin.org"`**: The target domain for the HTTP request. `httpbin.org` is a popular service for testing HTTP requests and responses.
        *   **`"User-Agent": "HTTPie/2.4.0"`**: Identifies the client software making the request as `HTTPie` version 2.4.0. HTTPie is a user-friendly command-line HTTP client.
        *   **`"X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-665be9f7-66c5d996-53896dfa"`**: An AWS X-Ray trace ID, indicating that the request might have traversed through an AWS service or a system that generates these distributed tracing identifiers.
4.  **Purpose/Context:** This output almost certainly represents the structured response (or part of it) from an HTTP GET request made to `httpbin.org/get` (or a similar endpoint that reflects request details). The presence of `args` and `headers` is characteristic of `httpbin`'s `/get` endpoint. The student is likely demonstrating or debugging how parameters and headers are sent and received in an HTTP request as part of a network programming or API interaction exercise.

Hi [@21f2000709](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f2000709)



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a series of Python commands executed in an IPython or Jupyter environment, demonstrating how to parse a JSON-formatted string into a Python dictionary using the `json` module.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Initial `jobj` value (before explicit assignment):** In cell `[28]`, the variable `jobj` appears to hold a string representation of a dictionary, but with single quotes inside (`"{'name':'jivraj'}"`). This format is not standard JSON.
2.  **Correct `jobj` assignment:** In cell `[29]`, `jobj` is explicitly assigned a string that correctly follows JSON syntax, using double quotes for both keys and string values (`'{"name":"jivraj"}'`).
3.  **`json.loads()` function:** Cell `[31]` demonstrates the use of `json.loads(jobj)` to convert the JSON string into a Python dictionary. This successfully transforms `{"name":"jivraj"}` (as a string) into `{'name': 'jivraj'}` (as a dictionary).
4.  **Accessing dictionary elements:** Cell `[32]` shows how to directly access a value from the parsed JSON object, `json.loads(jobj)['name']`, which returns the string `'jivraj'`.
5.  **Variable Type Check:** Cell `[33]` confirms that the variable `jobj` itself remains a string (`str`), even after `json.loads()` is used on its content. The `json.loads()` function returns a new dictionary object, it does not modify the original `jobj` variable's type.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

```
In [28]: jobj
Out[28]: "{'name':'jivraj'}"

In [29]: jobj = '{"name":"jivraj"}'

In [30]: jobj
Out[30]: '{"name":"jivraj"}'

In [31]: json.loads(jobj)
Out[31]: {'name': 'jivraj'}

In [32]: json.loads(jobj)['name']
Out[32]: 'jivraj'

In [33]: type(jobj)
Out[33]: str

In [34]: |
```*



This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object.

The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.  
We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a series of Python code cells executed within an interactive development environment (likely a Jupyter notebook), demonstrating the serialization and deserialization of JSON data, particularly when dealing with nested JSON strings.

### Key Information:

1.  **JSON Manipulation:** The primary focus is on using Python's `json` library (`json.dumps` for serialization and `json.loads` for deserialization).
2.  **Nested JSON String Handling:** A key aspect shown is how to handle a Python dictionary where one of its values is a *string* that itself represents a JSON object, complete with escaped characters. This requires careful parsing.
3.  **Process Flow:**
    *   A Python dictionary named `response` is initialized. Its "answer" key contains a string that is a JSON object with escaped double quotes (`\"`).
    *   The `response` dictionary is then serialized into a JSON formatted string (`send_response`) using `json.dumps` with `indent=2` for readability. The output shows that the inner escaped quotes (`\"`) become double-escaped (`\\\"`) when the outer dictionary is serialized.
    *   The `send_response` JSON string is then deserialized back into a Python object using `json.loads`.
    *   The value associated with the "answer" key is extracted into `tds_evaluator`. At this point, `tds_evaluator` holds the *string* representation of the inner JSON object (i.e., `{"args": {"challenge": "..."}}`). To actually work with `args` or `challenge` as Python dictionary elements, `tds_evaluator` would need *another* `json.loads` call.
    *   The final output is an enthusiastic message, suggesting that the JSON parsing and extraction process was successful and achieved the desired outcome for the user.
4.  **Execution Status:** Each code block shows a green checkmark and "0.0s" execution time, indicating successful and very fast completion without any errors.
5.  **Context (Implied):** The variable names like `tds_evaluator` and the content of the "challenge" string ("How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?") suggest this code is likely part of a data science course, challenge, or platform (possibly "Towards Data Science," given "TDS") where structured data, often in JSON format, needs to be processed.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

**Code Block 1:**
```python
response = {
    "answer": '{\\"args\\": {\\"challenge\\": \\"How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?\\"} }'
}

import json

send_response = json.dumps(response, indent=2)
print (send_response)
```
**Output 1:**
```
{
  "answer": "{\\\"args\\\": {\\\"challenge\\\": \\\"How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?\\\" }}"
}
```

**Code Block 2:**
```python
tds_evaluator = json.loads(send_response)['answer']
print (tds_evaluator)
```
**Output 2:**
```
{"args": {"challenge": "How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?"} }
```

**Code Block 3:**
```python
print ("OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!")
```
**Output 3:**
```
OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!
```*

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with `\"` however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information:

The screenshot displays a task or assignment from an online data science course, likely titled "TDS 2025 January" (or similar, "Ja..." is truncated). The content is hosted on `sanand.workers.dev`.

**The core assignment involves:**

1.  **Publishing a GitHub Page:** Students are required to create and publish a web page using GitHub Pages to showcase their work.
2.  **Email Inclusion:** The student's email address must be included in the HTML of the published page. A specific example email format (`22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) is provided, indicating an institutional or course-specific email structure.
3.  **Email Obfuscation Bypass:** A critical instruction is given regarding CloudFlare's email obfuscation on GitHub Pages. Students must wrap their email address within a specific HTML comment to prevent it from being obfuscated.
4.  **Submission:** Students need to provide the URL of their published GitHub Page. A general format for the URL (`https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`) is given as a hint.
5.  **Cache Busting Tip:** A tip is provided for when changes to the GitHub Page are not immediately visible, suggesting adding version parameters to the URL to bust the cache.
6.  **Grading Component:** A separate, small task or a related concept worth 0.5 marks is mentioned: "Use Google Colab". This reinforces the data science context of the course.

The top portion of the screenshot briefly shows elements of a development environment (possibly GitHub Codespaces or a similar online IDE), with indicators like "Set up job", "Codespaces", "main", and "Live Share", suggesting that practical coding and deployment are part of the course.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   **Example Email Address (as used in the text):**
    `22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`

*   **Email Obfuscation Bypass Code (HTML Comment):**
    The instruction states to wrap the email "inside a:" followed by this example:
    ```html
    <!--email_off-->22f3000819@ds.study.i
    ```
    *(Note: The example email within the code block is truncated due to the image boundary, showing only `22f3000819@ds.study.i`)*

*   **GitHub Pages URL Format (Example Hint):**
    `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`

*   **Cache Busting URL Parameters:**
    `?v=1`
    `?v=2`
    *(These appear in the text as `v=1, ?v=2`)**



  
For questions like this (there‚Äôs a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?  
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?  
If they don‚Äôt send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.

For GA-1 question 10,  
we need to get the hash of the json, from the site [JSON Hash](https://tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash),  
I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python?

You won‚Äôt be required to update someone else‚Äôs repo.  
Any github name, repo name is fine.  
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

Same for GA2 Quetion7 as well, you github url is required.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) and [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..

I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don‚Äôt have those answers). Thank you.

I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?

In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren‚Äôt any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

in the GA 4 question 5 ( Find the bounding box of a city ) Will the OSM\_id ending digits be provided. In the question body they are not there but on submission they come like in the attached screenshot.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context and Course Topic:** The screenshot appears to be from a module or section focusing on the "Impact" of data processing, specifically related to geographic data and bounding boxes. The text describes how "UrbanRide" can use automated extraction and processing of bounding box data to:
    *   Optimize Routing
    *   Improve Fleet Allocation
    *   Enhance Market Analysis
    *   Scale Operations
    This suggests the course is covering topics like Geographic Information Systems (GIS), location data, APIs (specifically Nominatim), and their applications in real-world scenarios like logistics or urban planning.

2.  **Problem Statement/Question:** The user is posed a specific question that requires querying a geographic API.
    *   **Question:** "What is the minimum latitude of the bounding box of the city Tianjin in the country China on the Nominatim API? Value of the minimum latitude"

3.  **User's Attempt/Input:** The user has provided an answer in an input field.
    *   **User's Answer:** `38.566`

4.  **Result and Error Message:** The user's input has been marked as incorrect, and an error message is displayed.
    *   **Error Indicator:** The input field is highlighted in red with an exclamation mark icon, indicating an error.
    *   **Error Message:** `Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077`

**Analysis of the Error:** The error message suggests that while the user might have attempted to find the latitude for Tianjin, the specific value `38.566` is not correct according to the expected answer. The hint "Check OSM ID ending with 2077" is crucial. It implies that there might be multiple Nominatim results for "Tianjin, China," or that the bounding box for a specific OpenStreetMap (OSM) object with an ID ending in `2077` is the one the question is looking for. The user would need to perform a Nominatim query, potentially examine the returned results, and locate the bounding box corresponding to the specified OSM ID to get the correct minimum latitude.*

Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn‚Äôt getting the markdown.
2. In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

**Respected TDS Team,**

I currently have Three doubts regarding **Project 2**:

1. As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I‚Äôm attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1‚Äîone is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.  

   

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a tabular dataset, likely from a spreadsheet application, representing sales transactions.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Dataset Type:** Transactional sales data.
2.  **Structure:** The dataset is organized into 7 columns and 14 rows of data, plus a header row.
3.  **Columns:**
    *   **TransactionID:** A unique identifier for each transaction, formatted as a four-digit number with leading zeros (e.g., 0001, 0002).
    *   **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in the transaction (e.g., John Doe, Bob Brown). Multiple transactions can be associated with the same customer.
    *   **Country:** The country of the customer. This column exhibits data inconsistency with various formats for the same country (e.g., "United States" vs. "US", "France" vs. "FRA" vs. "FR", "United Arab Emirates" vs. "AE" vs. "U.A.E" vs. "UAE").
    *   **Date:** The date of the transaction. Date formats are inconsistent, including MM-DD-YYYY (e.g., 10-13-2023), YYYY/MM/DD (e.g., 2022/10/14), and possibly DD-MM-YYYY (e.g., 01-11-2022).
    *   **Product/Code:** A string combining a product category name (often a Greek letter) and a specific product code, separated by a forward slash (e.g., Eta/fzflrq, Alpha/f2yscp).
    *   **Sales:** The total sales amount for the transaction, expressed in USD. The " USD" suffix is appended to the numerical value.
    *   **Cost:** The cost associated with the transaction, also expressed in USD with the " USD" suffix. There is one missing value for TransactionID 0007.

**Transcription of Data (including headers):**

2.  **Structure:** The data is organized into rows (transactions) and columns (attributes of each transaction).
3.  **Number of Records:** The visible portion of the table contains 17 transaction records, identified by `TransactionID` from `0001` to `0017`.

**Column Headers and Data Descriptions:**

*   **TransactionID:** A unique identifier for each transaction, formatted as a four-digit number with leading zeros (e.g., `0001`, `0017`).
*   **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in the transaction (e.g., `Frank Thomas`, `John Doe`, `Alice Johnson`).
*   **Country:** The country of the customer. This column exhibits inconsistency in its format, using a mix of abbreviations (e.g., `IND`, `US`, `IN`, `AE`, `Fra`, `Bra`) and full names or common abbreviations (e.g., `United Kingdom`, `U.S.A`, `U.K`).
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction. This column also shows format inconsistencies, with dates appearing in both `MM-DD-YYYY` (e.g., `12-01-2022`, `08-10-2023`, `10-01-2023`) and `YYYY/MM/DD` (e.g., `2022/09/04`, `2023/02/24`, `2023/05/10`) formats.
*   **Product/Code:** A combined field indicating the product type or family and a specific product code, separated by a forward slash (e.g., `Delta/tbakf3`, `Alpha/hknae9`, `Theta/mjrd4g`).
*   **Sales:** The revenue generated from the transaction, expressed as a numeric value followed by the currency `USD` (e.g., `7164 USD`, `2457 USD`).
*   **Cost:** The cost associated with the transaction, also expressed as a numeric value followed by the currency `USD` (e.g., `2062 USD`, `3439 USD`).

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are **no code, commands, or error messages** present in this screenshot. It solely displays a data table.*



     
   During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.
2. In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.  

   

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online data science course or learning platform, likely an exercise related to web scraping or API data handling (specifically JSON).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

*   **Course Context:** The exercise focuses on processing JSON data, likely obtained from a source like IMDb (given the `tt` ID and the explanatory text). The user is prompted to provide or verify the JSON data.
*   **User Input/Problem Area:** The user has provided a JSON object within an input field (outlined in red), which is likely part of a larger JSON array as indicated by the `[5]` index in the error message.
    *   The provided JSON object contains `id`, `title`, `year`, and `rating` fields.
    *   There's a syntactically incorrect trailing comma after the closing brace `}` of the JSON object, which would cause an error if this were the *only* object, but it's consistent with it being an element of an array where other elements would follow.
*   **Error Message:** The system detected a mismatch in the `title` field for the 6th item (index `5`) in the JSON data.
    *   **Crucial Anomaly:** The "Expected" and "Actual" values for the `title` field are displayed as identical (`"6. Naadaaniyan"`). This strongly suggests a subtle, non-visible difference between the values, such as:
        *   Hidden whitespace (leading, trailing, or within the string).
        *   Invisible control characters.
        *   Different Unicode characters that *look* the same (e.g., different types of spaces, or homoglyphs).
        *   An encoding issue.
        *   A display bug in the error message itself, where the actual difference isn't rendered.
*   **Troubleshooting Hints:** The platform provides helpful context and suggestions for resolving the issue:
    *   IMDb search results can vary by region.
    *   Users might need to manually translate titles (implying language or regional variations can cause mismatches).
    *   IMDb data can change periodically.
    *   Users may need to re-run their scraper code to get updated data.
*   **Action Button:** A "Check" button allows the user to submit their answer for validation.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Question:**
    ```
    What is the JSON data?
    ```
*   **User-Provided JSON (or expected format):**
    ```json
    {
    "id": "tt30422937",
    "title": "6. Naadaaniyan",
    "year": "2025",
    "rating": "3.0"
    },
    ```
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Error: At [5].title: Values don't match. Expected: "6. Naadaaniyan". Actual: "6. Naadaaniyan"
    ```
*   **Explanatory Text:**
    ```
    IMDb search results may differ by region. You may need to manually translate titles. Results may also change periodically. You may need to re-run your scraper code.
    ```
*   **Button Text:**
    ```
    Check
    ```*



     

   

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot, despite being from a "data science course forum," displays content that appears to be movie or TV show listings, likely as part of a dataset or an example for a data science project (e.g., recommendation systems, web scraping, data modeling, natural language processing on descriptions). There are no code, command, or error messages visible in this specific image.

**Key Information:**

The image shows a partial list of media content entries, featuring numbered items with associated metadata and descriptions.

**For Entry #6 (Nadaaniyan):**

*   **Content Type:** A movie or TV show listing.
*   **Title:** Nadaaniyan
*   **Poster Image:** A prominent movie poster is displayed, featuring a man and a woman embracing, with the title "Nadaaniyan" and "ONLY ON NETFLIX | 7 MAR" visible at the bottom.
*   **Release Year:** 2025
*   **Duration:** 1h 59m
*   **Content Rating:** TV-14
*   **User Rating:** 3.0 out of an implied 5 stars, based on 14,000 ratings.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   A "+" icon on the top left of the poster (likely for adding to a list or watchlist).
    *   A "Rate" link next to the star rating (allowing users to submit their own rating).
    *   An "i" (information) icon next to the content details (likely for more detailed information about the title).
    *   Dropdown/collapse arrows on the left side of the screen (implying the ability to expand/collapse sections of the forum or content listing).
*   **Description:** A synopsis of the plot.

**For other partial entries:**

*   **Entry #5 (above Nadaaniyan):** Only the description is visible.
*   **Entry #7 (below Nadaaniyan):** Only the number and title are visible.

**Context from a Data Science Perspective:**

Given this is from a "data science course forum," the data shown here would be highly relevant for:

1.  **Data Collection/Web Scraping:** This is a typical layout one might scrape from a movie database or streaming service for a dataset.
2.  **Data Modeling/Database Design:** How this data (title, year, duration, rating, description, content rating) would be structured in a database (e.g., SQL tables, NoSQL documents).
3.  **Recommendation Systems:** User ratings (3.0, 14K), genres (implied by description), and release year are all features used in building movie recommendation engines.
4.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The movie descriptions are perfect candidates for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, keyword extraction, or summarization.
5.  **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Converting "1h 59m" to a numerical duration, extracting the streaming service ("Netflix"), or parsing the rating details.
6.  **Data Visualization:** Visualizing trends in movie ratings, release years, or popularity.

**Transcribed Text:**

*   "An FBI agent and Florida State officer team up to investigate a string of unsolved murder cases."
*   "6. Nadaaniyan"
*   "2025 1h 59m TV-14"
*   "3.0 (14K) ‚≠ê Rate"
*   "A privileged Delhi socialite hires a middle-class student to pose as her boyfriend to maintain her social status. Their pretense becomes complicated when genuine feelings develop between them."
*   "7. Watson"*

### Post #100 by **Saransh Saini** (Course TA, ds-students)
*March 25, 2025, 08:44 UTC*
Hi [@23f2003751](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2003751)

### Short Answer: No

### Long Answer:

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn‚Äôt taking this into consideration. Check this out.  
This is my response  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an output from a data science course exercise, specifically showing the result of a JSON sorting operation.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Context:** The label "Sorted JSON:" indicates that the content displayed in the box is a JSON data structure that has been processed and sorted.
2.  **Data Structure:** The output is a JSON array (`[]`) containing multiple JSON objects (`{}`). Each object appears to represent an individual with "name" and "age" fields.
3.  **Sorted Data (Transcription):**
    The JSON array contains the following objects, which appear to be sorted, likely by "age" and then possibly by "name":
    `[ { "name": "Bob", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Emma", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Grace", "age": 14 }, { "na`
    *Note: The last object in the array is incomplete, displaying only `{ "na` before the visible content ends.*
4.  **Validation:**
    *   A green checkmark `‚úî` is visible within the output box, indicating a successful validation or completion of the task.
    *   Below the output box, the word "Correct" is displayed, further confirming that the displayed "Sorted JSON" is the expected or successful outcome for the exercise.

In summary, the screenshot shows a correctly sorted JSON array of objects, likely from a programming task where the user was required to sort a list of people by their name and age.*



which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes

## 

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum displays a common issue encountered when working with JSON data: a `SyntaxError`. The user is attempting to display or process "Sorted JSON" but the provided JSON string is malformed.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Context:**
The title "Sorted JSON:" suggests the user is working with JSON data, possibly after performing a sorting operation, and is now trying to parse or display the result.

**2. The JSON Data (as transcribed from the red-bordered box):**
```
[ { \"name\": "Bob", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Emma", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Grace", "age": 14 }, { "r
```

**Key Observations about the JSON Data:**
*   **Invalid Key Escaping:** The most prominent issue is in the first JSON object: `{ \"name\": "Bob", ...`. The key `"name"` is incorrectly escaped with backslashes (`\`) as `\"name\"`. In JSON, keys (and string values) are simply enclosed in double quotes; backslashes are used only to escape special characters *within* a string value (e.g., a literal double quote inside a string). A key itself does not require or allow these escapes around its enclosing quotes. This is a fundamental JSON syntax error.
*   **Correct Keys in Subsequent Objects:** Interestingly, the subsequent objects (`{ "name": "Emma", ... }`, `{ "name": "Grace", ... }`) have their "name" keys correctly formatted without the backslashes. This indicates the error is specific to the first object's representation.
*   **Truncated/Incomplete JSON:** The JSON string abruptly ends with `{ "r`. This is an incomplete JSON object, missing a closing double quote for the key, a colon, a value, and a closing curly brace (`}`). This would independently cause a syntax error if the first issue weren't present.
*   **Error Icon:** An exclamation mark in a circle `(r!)` is visible at the very end of the JSON string, indicating an error at that point as well.

**3. The Error Message:**
```
SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)
```

**Interpretation of the Error:**
*   **`SyntaxError`**: This indicates that the JSON parser encountered invalid syntax and could not successfully interpret the string as a valid JSON structure.
*   **`Expected property name or '}'`**: The parser, at the specified position, was expecting either the start of a new property (a key enclosed in double quotes) or the closing brace of a JSON object.
*   **`at position 16 (line 1 column 17)`**: This pinpoints the exact location where the parser encountered the unexpected syntax.
    Let's trace the characters from the beginning:
    12345678901234567
    `[ { \"name\": "Bob"`
    Counting from `[`, the `B` in `"Bob"` is at position 16 (and column 17 if counting spaces before the string and assuming the display is 1-indexed for lines/columns). The error message suggests that because of the malformed key `\"name\"`, the parser got confused and by the time it reached "Bob", it was expecting a valid JSON structure (like a proper key or closing brace) but instead found something it couldn't interpret in that context. The presence of the backslashes in `\"name\"` is the root cause that derails the parser at this early stage.*

[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

it can‚Äôt be fixed actually, you would need the answer in the json format

`{"answer": "actual_answer"}`

but if the actual\_answer needs to be string and if it happens to be of json type, it has to be represented using `\"`

> 

> **Image Content:** *As an expert at analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a description of the key information presented in the image, along with a precise transcription of the data.

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a tabular dataset, likely from a spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel), containing transaction records. It appears to be a sample dataset used for demonstrating data handling, cleaning, or analysis in a data science context.

*   **Dataset Size:** The table contains 14 rows of data entries (TransactionID 0001 through 0014).
*   **Columns:** There are 7 distinct columns providing information about each transaction:
    *   `TransactionID`: A unique identifier for each transaction.
    *   `Customer Name`: The name of the customer involved in the transaction.
    *   `Country`: The country of the customer or transaction origin.
    *   `Date`: The date the transaction occurred.
    *   `Product/Code`: A field combining product name and a specific product code.
    *   `Sales`: The revenue generated from the transaction.
    *   `Cost`: The cost associated with the transaction.
*   **Data Characteristics (Relevant for Data Science):**
    *   **Data Inconsistencies:** The `Country` column shows inconsistent abbreviations (e.g., "United States", "US"; "France", "FRA"; "United Arab Emirates", "AE", "U.A.E", "UAE"). This highlights a common data quality issue requiring standardization.
    *   **Mixed Date Formats:** The `Date` column exhibits different formats (e.g., "MM-DD-YYYY" like `10-13-2023` and "YYYY/MM/DD" like `2022/10/14`), which would necessitate parsing and conversion to a uniform date type for analysis.
    *   **Missing Values:** There is a missing value in the `Cost` column for `TransactionID 0007`.
    *   **Combined Fields:** The `Product/Code` column combines two pieces of information (product name and code) separated by a slash, which might need to be split into separate columns for more granular analysis.
    *   **Currency Representation:** The `Sales` and `Cost` columns include "USD" as part of the string, meaning these columns are not directly numerical and would require cleaning (e.g., removing " USD" and converting to a numerical data type) before calculations.

**Transcription of Data:**

No specific code, commands, or error messages are present. The request asks for transcription of any such elements "exactly as they appear," and in this case, it pertains to the tabular data.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a tabular dataset, likely representing a series of sales or financial transactions. Each row corresponds to a unique transaction, providing detailed information across several categories. This type of data is fundamental in data science for tasks such as sales performance analysis, customer behavior insights, geographical sales distribution, and profitability assessment.

**Key Information:**

*   **Dataset Structure:** The data is presented in a clear table format with distinct column headers.
*   **Columns:** There are seven columns:
    *   `TransactionID`: A unique identifier for each transaction, formatted as a four-digit number.
    *   `Customer Name`: The name of the customer involved in the transaction. There are multiple instances of the same customer names (e.g., "John Doe", "Alice Johnson").
    *   `Country`: The country of the customer or transaction. Various formats are used, indicating a need for data standardization (e.g., "IND", "IN", "Ind" for India; "US", "U.S.A"; "United Kingdom", "U.K"; "Fra", "FRA").
    *   `Date`: The date of the transaction. Date formats vary (e.g., "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY/MM/DD"), which would require parsing for consistent date-time analysis.
    *   `Product/Code`: Identifies the product involved, often appearing as a product type (e.g., "Delta", "Alpha", "Theta", "Eta", "Beta", "Zeta", "Kappa") followed by a slash and a unique alphanumeric code.
    *   `Sales`: The sales revenue generated from the transaction, denominated in USD.
    *   `Cost`: The cost associated with the transaction, also denominated in USD.
*   **Missing Values:** Notably, the `Cost` column appears to have missing values for `TransactionID` 0006, 0008, and 0009. This is a common data quality issue that needs to be addressed in data cleaning.
*   **Data Consistency:** Inconsistencies in date formats and country spellings/abbreviations are present, suggesting a requirement for data cleaning and standardization before analysis.

**Transcribed Data:**

| TransactionID | Customer Name   | Country        | Date         | Product/Code   | Sales      | Cost      |

The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.

All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.

Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a set of instructions and a Python code snippet designed to be run in Google Colaboratory (Colab).

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The primary goal is to verify a user's ability to access and run programs in Google Colab, specifically involving Google account authentication and API interaction. It instructs the user to "allow all required access" to a specified email ID (`23f1001524@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, likely a placeholder or example) during the authentication process.
2.  **Environment:** The code is explicitly designed to be run in **Google Colab**.
3.  **Process Overview:**
    *   The Python script first authenticates the user with their Google account via `google.colab.auth`.
    *   It then retrieves the user's access token and uses it to make an authenticated API call to `www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo` to get the user's email address.
    *   Finally, it constructs a string using the retrieved email and the expiry year of the authentication token. It calculates the SHA256 hash of this string, converts it to a hexadecimal representation, and extracts the last 5 characters.
4.  **Expected Output:** The user is prompted to provide the "result" of running the code, which "should be a 5-character string." This suggests the script generates a unique identifier or verification code for the user.
5.  **Context:** This appears to be a setup or an early assignment in a data science course, common for verifying environment readiness and basic programming skills.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages (None shown, but the code is present):**

```python
import hashlib
import requests
from google.colab import auth
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

auth.authenticate_user()
creds = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
token = creds.get_access_token().access_token
response = requests.get(
"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo",
params={"alt": "json"},
headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)
email = response.json()["email"]
hashlib.sha256(f"{email} {creds.token_expiry.year}".encode()).hexdigest()[-5:]
```

**Instruction/Question Text:**

*   "Let's make sure you can access Google Colab. Run this program on Google Colab, allowing all required access to your email ID: 23f1001524@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   "What is the result? (It should be a 5-character string)"*



  
How to parameterise this function? It is really difficult to do this function with other parameter, please help. what is approach other than hardcoding it?

# Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday‚Äôs Session)

Respected TDS Team,

As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following [@Saransh](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh)‚Äôs suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.

---

## Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue

1. GA3 Q8

   * Issue: The question doesn‚Äôt mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.
2. GA3 Q9

   * Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY\_TOKEN.
   * Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?
3. GA4 Q2 & Q10

   * Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
   * Reference: [GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/98)
4. Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)

   * Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
   * Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {‚Äúanswer‚Äù: ‚Äúresult‚Äù}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.
5. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions

   * Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a \*\*live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
   * Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?

---

## Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday‚Äôs Session)

Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:

1. Platform Capability for GA Tasks

   * Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
   * Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.
2. File Upload Example via Platform API

   * Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
   * This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.
3. General Observations on GA1-5  
   Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) ( [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) ) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like **need**

**Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st),**  
*(actually 1 day extension is April 1st)*

Hi [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382) ,  
Unfortunately it‚Äôs not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.

All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2

Yes you are absolutely right. I confirmed this with Carlton and Anand sir, and yes you have to send the JSON responses as strings, which will automatically add those backslashes(\). I apologies for causing this confusion, and I hope I was able to clarify it.

Hi [@21f3001993](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f3001993)  
You can use the `zipfile` library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don‚Äôt even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday‚Äôs [27-03-2025] Live Session.

just to clarify if the llm is giving the output like this the evaluation script will mark it correct.

```
{
 "answer": "[{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":16},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":23},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":28},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":36},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":44},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":57},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":65},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":68},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":70},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":88},{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":94},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":97}]"

### Post #123 by **Carlton D'Silva** (Regular, ds-students)

Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.

Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.

The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.

The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)

To check if a string has invisible characters,

```
# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])

```

e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9

This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,

```
import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 

```

See what happens when I print the result

```
print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a successful execution of a Python script within a terminal environment, likely on a macOS system. It demonstrates the output of a multi-line string containing various whitespace elements.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Environment and User Context:**
    *   The user's shell prompt shows `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %`. This indicates:
        *   **User/Environment:** `.venvcarland` suggests that a Python virtual environment named `venvcarland` is active, which is a common practice in data science to manage project-specific dependencies.
        *   **Hostname:** `Carlton-MacBook-Pro` identifies the machine as a MacBook Pro.
        *   **Current Directory:** The user is currently in the `tds` directory.
        *   **Shell:** The `%` prompt typically indicates a Zsh shell (the default on modern macOS), or possibly tcsh.

2.  **Command Executed:**
    *   The command executed is `/User/tds/test.py`. This is an absolute path to a Python script. The direct execution (without `python` explicitly preceding the file path) suggests that the script likely has a [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python3`) and has been made executable (`chmod +x`).

3.  **Script Output:**
    *   Following the command, the script prints a multi-line string. This output is designed to demonstrate how text with explicit newlines, multiple spaces, and tabs is rendered in the terminal.
    *   Notice the distinct formatting:
        *   "multiple lines with    spaces" has a double space before "spaces".
        *   "and a tab        as well." has a tab character (which renders as multiple spaces) before "as well.".

4.  **Execution Status:**
    *   The appearance of a new prompt (`‚ú® .venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %`) directly below the output, along with the `‚ú®` emoji, indicates that the `test.py` script executed successfully without any errors. The emoji is a common customization in shells like Zsh (often via Oh My Zsh) to signal a successful command return.

**Transcription of Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

```
.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds % /User/tds/test.py
This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines   with    spaces
and some newlines
and a tab		as well.
‚ú® .venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %
```*



Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.

Here is a json example:

```
json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Look at the response. A perfect json.  


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The user `carland` is working in a terminal session on a machine named `Carlton-MacBook-Pro`. The prompt indicates that a Python virtual environment might be active or referenced by the `.venv` prefix in the username part of the prompt. The current working directory is `tds`, which is likely a project folder related to "The Data Science" course or a similar context.
2.  **Action:** A Python script named `test.py`, located within the current `tds` directory (path `tds/test.py`), was executed directly from the command line. This implies the script likely has its executable permissions set and a shebang line, or it's being run via an alias/shell function.
3.  **Output:** The script successfully ran and produced a JSON object as its output. The JSON object contains two key-value pairs:
    *   `"mary": "poppins"` (a string key with a string value)
    *   `"age": 42` (a string key with an integer value)
4.  **Completion:** After the script executed and printed its output, the command prompt reappeared, indicating that the command completed successfully and the shell is ready for the next input. The shell prompt symbols (a blue circle `‚Ä¢` and a sparkling star `‚ú®`) are visual indicators, likely part of a custom shell theme (e.g., Oh My Zsh).

This screenshot demonstrates a common workflow in data science and development: executing a Python script from the terminal and observing its structured output (JSON).

**Transcription of Code, Commands, and Output:**

```
‚Ä¢ .venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds % tds/test.py
{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}
‚ú® .venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %
```*



If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

Kind regards

### Post #124 by **Pradeep Mondal** (ds-students)
*March 27, 2025, 08:27 UTC*
I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.  
5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can‚Äôt exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.

5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

Hey guys, I have designed the code, and it currently works for the first 11 GA1 questions and the sixth and third questions of GA2. I have accounted for all edge cases. Please check the code at this link:  
<https://4e52-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app/>.  
Let me know your thoughts!

1. **GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**

* As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.
* To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page‚Äôs availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10‚Äì20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process‚Äîfrom initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live‚Äîtakes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.
* However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly‚Äîbefore the GitHub Pages site is actually live‚Äîresulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure‚Äôs request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform‚Äôs allowed response duration.

2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**

* A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.
* Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays two distinct but related components from a data science course forum or lesson interface, focusing on API interaction and GitHub Pages.

### Key Information:

**Left Pane (API Request and Server Response):**
This section details a successful API call, showing the request made and the data received.

*   **Request URL**: The application made a request to a local API endpoint.
*   **Server Response Code**: An HTTP status code of `200` indicates a successful request.
*   **Response Body**: The server returned a JSON object containing a URL, which appears to be a GitHub Pages URL.
*   **Response Headers**: Standard HTTP headers are present, including CORS settings (`access-control-allow-credentials`, `access-control-allow-origin`), content details (`content-length`, `content-type`), date, and the server type (`uvicorn`).

**Right Pane (GitHub Pages Lesson Content):**
This section provides educational content and a question related to GitHub Pages, specifically concerning URL structure and email obfuscation.

*   **GitHub Pages and CloudFlare**: It explains that GitHub Pages utilizes CloudFlare, which has a feature to obfuscate email addresses by default.
*   **Email Obfuscation Solution**: Instructions are provided on how to prevent email obfuscation by wrapping the email address within specific HTML comments (`<!--email_off-->` and `<!--/email_off-->`).
*   **GitHub Pages URL Question**: A question prompts the user to identify or provide the correct GitHub Pages URL format, giving a general template (`https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`).
*   **User's Correct Answer**: The user has successfully entered the correct GitHub Pages URL, which matches the URL received in the API response from the left pane. This indicates the user successfully identified the URL or used the API's output.
*   **Cache Busting Tip**: A practical tip is offered to "bust the cache" for GitHub Pages by appending version query parameters (e.g., `?v=1`, `?v=2`) to the URL, which is useful when recent changes are not reflected immediately.

**Overall Context:**
The two panes are interconnected, suggesting a task where the student needs to use the output of an API call (the GitHub Pages URL) to answer a question or complete a step related to GitHub Pages deployment or understanding. The student identifier `21f3001076` is consistently present in both the example email address and the GitHub Pages URL, indicating a personalized assignment or demonstration.

### **Final Thoughts on Project 2**

Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I‚Äôd like to share a few reflections‚Äînot as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.

1. **Organization & Structure:**  
   The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone‚Äîjust sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**  
   There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
3. **Time Constraints:**  
   Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
4. **Sessions & Support:**  
   The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
5. **Deployment Variability:**  
   Each GA‚Äôs questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**  
   I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it‚Äôs also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail‚Äîeven the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**  
   Even for someone with a technical background, it‚Äôs difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn‚Äôt always feasible before the deadline.

---

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot details a data analysis task involving a GZipped Apache log file. It specifies the file's characteristics, defines the fields within each log entry, outlines parsing rules, and presents the first few analytical questions.

**Key Information:**

*   **Task Goal:** Analyze an Apache web log file from the site `s-anand.net` for May 2024.
*   **Data Source:** A GZipped Apache log file (61MB) containing 258,074 rows. Each row is a web log entry.
*   **Log Entry Fields:** Each row contains the following fields:
    *   **IP:** The IP address of the visitor.
    *   **Remote logname:** The remote logname of the visitor. Typically `"-"`.
    *   **Remote user:** The remote user of the visitor. Typically `"-"`.
    *   **Time:** The time of the visit. Example: `[01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]`. A crucial note states: "Not that **this is not quoted** and you need to handle this."
    *   **Request:** The request made by the visitor. Example: `GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1`. This field has three space-separated parts:
        *   (a) **Method:** The HTTP method. Example: `GET`.
        *   (b) **URL:** The URL visited. Example: `/blog/`.
        *   (c) **Protocol:** The HTTP protocol. Example: `HTTP/1.1`.
    *   **Status:** The HTTP status code. `200 <= Status < 300` indicates a successful request.
    *   **Size:** The size of the response in bytes. Example: `1234`.
    *   **Referer:** The referer URL. Example: `https://s-anand.net/`.
    *   **User agent:** The browser used. This field "will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes."
    *   **Vhost:** The virtual host. Example: `s-anand.net`.
    *   **Server:** The IP address of the server.

*   **Parsing Rules & Data Peculiarities:**
    *   Fields are separated by spaces.
    *   Fields are quoted by double quotes (`""`).
    *   **Important Quoting Rule:** Unlike CSV files, "quoted fields are escaped via `\"` and not `"""."` This impacts 41 rows.
    *   All data and questions are based in the `GMT-0500` timezone.

*   **Specific Tasks:**
    1.  **Filter the Log Entries:** "Extract only the requests where the URL starts with `/malayalamp3/`. Include only those requests made on the specified `2024-05-15`."
    2.  **Aggregate Data by IP:** "Sum the "Size" field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries."

Dear Sirs,

I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the `.gz` file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the `.gz` file?

Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?

Essentialy, will the API call look like so?

> curl -X POST ‚Äú<http://127.0.0.1:5000>‚Äù   
> -H ‚ÄúContent-Type: multipart/form-data‚Äù

One of the site‚Äôs key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.  
How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn‚Äôt help.

Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.  
It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I believe it would strike a good balance‚Äîteam made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.

Hi [@22f3002933](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3002933)

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/lakshaygarg654),  
Yes for GA4\_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.  
Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

Thanks for the answer sir.

I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.

Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.

I‚Äôve figured out the solution to that particular question.  
The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions‚Äîsimilar to the project 1 workflow‚Äîand This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva‚Äôs and oppe‚Äôs )

Hi [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) ,

In the sample curl command  
i.e.

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"

```

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,

Query about Week2 Q3 and Q7 Publishing a page or action takes time to reflect the site or action performed in github. how to solve this timing issue ? Github repo creation and file /action addition completes immediately but publishing of file /action takes time causing the resulting URL to return 404 for a long time before it returns the correct 200 status and content in response.

Hello Sir,

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py`, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.`

However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as ‚Äúquestion.pdf.‚Äù How can I effectively manage this problem?

Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word ‚Äúcode‚Äù and executes `first.py` for GA1.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!

Best regards,  
vicky kumar

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I am bit confused about answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one is correct process.  
1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my\_response as json formatted string)  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python code cell from what appears to be an interactive development environment (like a Jupyter notebook or an online code editor), common in data science courses. It demonstrates how to parse a JSON string and extract specific data.

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** A code editor interface with a "run" or "play" button, indicating an executable code cell.
2.  **Programming Language:** Python, given the `import json`, variable assignment, and `print()` function.
3.  **Core Task:** Parsing a JSON string.
4.  **JSON Data:** A string variable `my_response` holds a JSON object. The JSON structure is `{"answer": "26272"}`. Note the use of backslashes (`\`) to escape the double quotes within the Python string, allowing the double quotes to be part of the string literal rather than terminating it.
5.  **JSON Parsing:** The `json.loads()` function from the imported `json` module is used to convert the JSON string (`my_response`) into a Python dictionary.
6.  **Data Extraction:** After parsing, the code accesses the value associated with the key `"answer"` from the resulting Python dictionary.
7.  **Output:** The extracted value is printed to the console below the code cell.

### Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

**Code:**

```python
import json
my_response = "{\"answer\": \"26272\"}"
print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])
```

**Output:**

```
26272
```*



2nd process ( This one is Json object)  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a snippet of Python code executed within an interactive environment, most likely a Jupyter Notebook or an IPython console, indicated by the cell number `[14]` and the distinct output format.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The code is being run in an interactive Python environment, typical for data science workflows and courses. The `[14]` signifies it's the 14th input cell executed.
2.  **Code Purpose:** The code demonstrates how to define a Python dictionary, store a key-value pair within it, and then retrieve and print a specific value using its corresponding key.
3.  **`json` Module Import:** The first line `import json` imports the `json` module, which is commonly used for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. However, in this specific visible snippet, the `json` module is imported but **not used**. This could imply that the larger context of the problem involves handling JSON data, or it's a leftover import from a previous attempt/example.
4.  **Dictionary Creation:** A Python dictionary named `my_response` is created. It contains a single key-value pair:
    *   **Key:** `"answer"` (a string)
    *   **Value:** `"26272"` (a string, not an integer, due to the quotes).
5.  **Value Retrieval and Printing:** The `print(my_response["answer"])` command accesses the value associated with the key `"answer"` from the `my_response` dictionary and outputs it to the console.
6.  **Output:** The code successfully retrieves and prints the string `"26272"`. There are no error messages, indicating successful execution of the visible code.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

**Cell Input Number:**
`[14]`

**Code:**
```python
import json
my_response = {"answer": "26272"}

print(my_response["answer"])
```

**Output:**
```
26272
```*



or both are incorrect?

This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python script that contains another Python script encoded as a string within a JSON object. The outer script's purpose is to parse this JSON and print the embedded code. The inner, embedded script defines a function to perform sentiment analysis using OpenAI's API.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Overall Structure:**
    *   The main Python script imports the `json` library.
    *   It defines a multi-line string variable `my_response`. This string is itself a JSON object containing a single key, `"answer"`.
    *   The value associated with the `"answer"` key is a heavily escaped string representing another complete Python script.
    *   The final line of the main script `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])` demonstrates how to extract and print this embedded Python script. This implies the outer script is designed to either retrieve or display code that might be stored in a structured format (like JSON).

2.  **Embedded Python Script (`answer` content):**
    *   **Purpose:** To interact with the OpenAI Chat Completions API (`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`) to perform sentiment analysis.
    *   **Dependencies:** It implicitly requires the `httpx` library (evident from `httpx.post`).
    *   **Function Definition:** Defines a function `analyze_sentiment()`:
        *   It sets up the `url` for the OpenAI API endpoint.
        *   It defines `headers`, including `Authorization` with a placeholder `Bearer dummy_api_key` and `Content-Type: application/json`.
        *   It constructs the `data` payload for the API request:
            *   `model`: Specifies `gpt-4o-mini`.
            *   `messages`: Contains two roles:
                *   `system`: Instructs the model to "Analyze the sentiment of the given text and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL."
                *   `user`: Provides a sample text for analysis, which appears to be a random string of characters (`P5I 3P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB sY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9`). This text would typically be replaced by actual user input for sentiment analysis.
        *   It makes a `POST` request using `httpx.post()`.
        *   It includes `response.raise_for_status()` for HTTP error handling (raises an exception for bad status codes).
        *   It parses the JSON response from the API (`response.json()`).
        *   It returns the `result`.
    *   **Execution Block:** It includes a standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to execute `analyze_sentiment()` when the embedded script is run directly.
    *   **Error Handling:** It uses a `try...except Exception as e:` block to catch and print any errors that occur during the execution of `analyze_sentiment()`.

3.  **Potential Use Cases/Context:**
    *   This code could be part of a system that dynamically generates or retrieves Python functions, possibly from a configuration file, database, or API, and then runs them.
    *   In a data science context, this pattern might be used for:
        *   Storing and managing reusable AI model interaction snippets.
        *   Providing templates for users to quickly get started with LLM calls.
        *   Automated code generation or deployment.

4.  **Key Pointers for Users:**
    *   The `dummy_api_key` needs to be replaced with an actual OpenAI API key for the embedded code to function correctly.
    *   The sample `user` content (`P5I 3P1xw...`) within the `data` payload needs to be replaced with the actual text for which sentiment analysis is desired.
    *   The `httpx` library is required and would need to be installed (`pip install httpx`) if the embedded code were to be executed.
    *   The final `print` statement in the outer script *outputs the code itself*, not the result of running the `analyze_sentiment` function. To run the embedded code, one would typically use `exec(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])` (with caution).

---

### Transcribed Code:

```python
import json
my_response = "{\"answer\": \"import httpx\\\\n\\\\ndef analyze_sentiment():\\\\n    url = \\\"\\\\\\"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\\\\\\"\\\\n    headers = {\\\\\\"Authorization\\\\\\": \\\\\\"Bearer dummy_api_key\\\\\\",\\\\n               \\\\\\"Content-Type\\\\\\": \\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\"}\\\\n    data = {\\\\\\"model\\\\\\": \\\\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\"messages\\\\\\": [\\\\n                {\\\\"role\\\\\\": \\\\\\"system\\\\\\", \\\\\\"content\\\\\\": \\\\\\"Analyze the sentiment of\\\\n                                   the given text and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL.\\\\\\"}\\\\n                {\\\\"role\\\\\\": \\\\\\"user\\\\\\", \\\\\\"content\\\\\\": \\\\\\"P5I 3P1xw aE\\\\n                                   WvYHB6zc5xB sY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9\\\\\\"}\\\\n            ]}\\\\n    response = httpx.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)\\\\n    response.raise_for_status()\\\\n    result = response.json()\\\\n    return result\\\\n\\\\n# Execute the function and print the result\\\\nif __name__ == \\\\\\"__main__\\\\\\":\\\\n    try:\\\\n        sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment()\\\\n        print(sentiment_result)\\\\n    except Exception as e:\\\\n        print(f\\\\\\"Error: {e}\\\\\\"}\\\\n)\""

print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])
```*



This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python script, likely from a Jupyter Notebook or similar interactive environment, designed to demonstrate or process a piece of text that *itself* contains executable Python code.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Outer Python Script:**
    *   It begins by importing the `json` library.
    *   It defines a Python dictionary named `my_response`.
    *   This dictionary has a single key, `"answer"`, whose value is a very long string.
    *   The string value of `"answer"` is a complete, escaped Python script. This means newline characters (`\n`) and double quotes (`\"`) are represented literally within the string.
    *   The final line of the outer script prints the raw string value of `my_response["answer"]`. This means the *nested* Python code will be printed as a string, not executed by the outer script itself.

2.  **Inner (Nested) Python Script (the string value of `my_response["answer"]`):**
    *   **Purpose:** This script is designed to perform sentiment analysis using the OpenAI API.
    *   **HTTP Client:** It imports and uses `httpx`, a modern HTTP client library for Python.
    *   **Function Definition:** It defines a function `analyze_sentiment()` that encapsulates the API call logic.
    *   **OpenAI API Interaction:**
        *   It targets the `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
        *   It includes a placeholder `Authorization` header with a `Bearer dummy_api_key`.
        *   It sends a JSON payload specifying the `gpt-4o-mini` model.
        *   The `messages` array contains:
            *   A system message instructing the model to "Analyze the sentiment of the given text and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL."
            *   A user message with a seemingly random string of characters (`"P5I3P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB sY4QZV 0BM8TDP7e o MOG4R9"`) for sentiment analysis.
        *   It makes a `POST` request, checks for HTTP errors with `response.raise_for_status()`, and parses the JSON response.
        *   The `analyze_sentiment` function returns the JSON result from the API.
    *   **Execution Block:**
        *   It includes a standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure the code runs when the script is executed directly.
        *   It uses a `try-except` block for error handling, calling `analyze_sentiment()` and printing the result, or printing an error message if an exception occurs.

**Interpretation in a Data Science Course Context:**

This example likely illustrates one of the following concepts:

*   **API Integration:** How to interact with external APIs (specifically, a large language model API like OpenAI) from Python.
*   **LLM Code Generation:** It could be an example of output from an LLM that generated a Python script. The outer `my_response` dictionary might mimic how an LLM's response is structured, where the "answer" field contains the generated code.
*   **String Manipulation/Escaping:** Demonstrates how to handle multi-line strings and escaped characters (`\n`, `\"`) when storing code within a string.
*   **Programmatic API Calls:** Shows how to make a complete program to interact with a service rather than using a simple client library call.

**Code Transcription:**

```python
import json

my_response = {
    "answer": "import httpx\\nndef analyze_sentiment():\\n    url = \\"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\\"\\n    headers = {\\n        \\"Authorization\\": \\"Bearer dummy_api_key\\",\\n        \\"Content-Type\\": \\"application/json\\"\\n    }\\n    data = {\\n        \\"model\\": \\"gpt-4o-mini\\",\\n        \\"messages\\": [\\n            {\\"role\\": \\"system\\", \\"content\\": \\"Analyze the sentiment of the given text and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL.\\"},\\n            {\\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"P5I3P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB sY4QZV 0BM8TDP7e o MOG4R9\\"}\\n        ]\\n    }\\n    response = httpx.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)\\n    response.raise_for_status()\\n    result = response.json()\\n    return result\\n\\n# Execute the function and print the result\\nif __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\\n    try:\\n        sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment()\\n        print(sentiment_result)\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        print(f\\"Error: {e}\\" )"
}

HI [@ripusudan](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/ripusudan)  
This has been a problem with all direct entry students. Unfortunately, there is no way we can help you with this problem. The best way out is asking a friend who is not a TDS student for this term to create a Azure VM for you.

I couldn‚Äôt find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling.

Saransh\_Saini:

At this moment it can‚Äôt be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as ‚Äúquestion‚Äù and file parameter as ‚Äúfile‚Äù in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.

To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?

Edit:  
Just now discovered that the field names are indeed ‚Äúquestion‚Äù and ‚Äúfile‚Äù only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.

I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice.

GA1:  
Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

GA2:  
Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app‚Äôs response be like this

```
{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
}

```

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

GA3:

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.

GA4:

The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

GA5:

No particular questions at the moment.

Please help me out by answering these asap

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.  
`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It‚Äôs clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays instructions for how a student's answer or response should be formatted for an assignment. The core message is that the submission must be a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object.

Specifically, it outlines the following requirements:

1.  **Format:** The response must be a JSON object.
2.  **Content:** This JSON object must contain exactly one field.
3.  **Field Type:** This single field must hold a text (string) value.
4.  **Field Name:** The required name for this single field is "answer".
5.  **Submission Method:** The formatted JSON object can be directly entered into the assignment system.
6.  **Example Provided:** A concrete example of the expected JSON structure is given, illustrating the "answer" field containing a sample string value "1234567890".

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: answer that can be directly entered in the
assignment. For example:

json
{
  "answer": "1234567890"
}
```*

Check with other student if they have a different email then it is a parameter and can change.

This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline.

Same answer as Q13 GA1

22f3000819:

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```  
One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:

```
au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u

```

Write a Python program that uses `httpx` to send a POST request to OpenAI‚Äôs API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:

1. Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.
2. Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the model.
3. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.
4. The second message must be **exactly** the text contained above.

This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.

**Note**: This uses a dummy `httpx` library, not the real one. You can only use:

1. `response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)`
2. `response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)`
3. `response.raise_for_status()`
4. `response.json()`

```

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long‚Äîit‚Äôs not that big.

I guess [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) is right.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum illustrates a common misunderstanding when working with JSON in Python, specifically the usage of `json.loads()` and `json.dumps()`.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. The Problem and Error:**
The user initially defines `my_response` as a Python dictionary. They then attempt to use `json.loads(my_response)` directly on this dictionary.

*   **Code Attempt (Cell 1):**
    ```python
    import json
    my_response = {
        "answer": "26272"
    }
    print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])
    ```

*   **Error Message:**
    This attempt results in a `TypeError`. The `json.loads()` function expects its input to be a string (or bytes/bytearray) that represents a valid JSON document, not a Python dictionary.

    ```
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-1-28ad5ba89266> in <cell line: 0>()
          4 }
          5
    ---> 6 print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])

    /usr/lib/python3.11/json/__init__.py in loads(s, cls, object_hook, parse_float, parse_int, parse_constant, object_pairs_hook)
        337         else:
        338             if not isinstance(s, (bytes, bytearray)):
    --> 339                 raise TypeError(f'the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not {s.__class__.__name__}')
        340             f'not {s.__class__.__name__}'
        341             s = s.decode(detect_encoding(s), 'surrogateescape')

    TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not dict
    ```

**2. The Solution:**
The user correctly identifies the issue and implements the fix in the subsequent code block. To process the Python dictionary (`my_response`) using `json.loads()`, it first needs to be converted into a JSON string. This is achieved using `json.dumps()`.

*   **Code Solution (Cell 2):**
    ```python
    import json
    my_response = {
        "answer": "26272"
    }
    #converting json object to string as "{\"answer\": \"26272\"}"
    my_response= json.dumps(my_response)
    print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])
    ```

*   **Output:**
    ```
    26272
    ```

**Key Takeaway for the Forum:**
This demonstrates the fundamental difference between a Python dictionary object and a JSON string representation of that object.
*   `json.dumps()`: Converts a Python object (like a dictionary or list) into a JSON formatted **string**. This is often called "serializing" or "encoding".
*   `json.loads()`: Parses a JSON formatted **string** (or bytes/bytearray) and converts it into a Python object. This is often called "deserializing" or "decoding".

The problem arose because `json.loads()` was given a Python dictionary, but it expects a string. The solution correctly serializes the dictionary to a string first using `json.dumps()`, allowing `json.loads()` to then successfully parse that string back into a Python object.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "Your Task" section from a data science course or assignment forum, outlining a specific web scraping and data formatting task.

### Key Information:

The task requires students to perform the following steps:

1.  **Data Source:** Access movie data from IMDb's advanced web search page. This implies the use of web scraping techniques (e.g., using libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Playwright/Selenium in Python) to interact with the website and extract information.
2.  **Filtering Criteria:** Only titles with a rating between 2 and 8 (inclusive) should be considered. This indicates a data filtering step, which could be done either at the source (if IMDb's search allows for such a precise filter) or after extracting more data.
3.  **Data Extraction & Formatting:**
    *   Extract a maximum of 25 movie titles.
    *   For each title, extract four specific data points: `ID`, `title`, `year`, and `rating`.
    *   A critical hint is provided for extracting the `ID`: it's the part of the URL found after `tt` within the `href` attribute of a movie link. This is a common pattern for IMDb IDs.
    *   The extracted data must be organized into a specific JSON array structure, where each movie is an object with the specified keys (`id`, `title`, `year`, `rating`) and their corresponding string values. This requires JSON serialization.
4.  **Submission:** The final JSON output needs to be submitted in a designated text box.

This is a practical exercise designed to test skills in web scraping, data parsing, data cleaning (filtering), and data serialization into a standard format (JSON).

### Transcribed Content:

```
Your Task

1. Source: Utilize IMDb's advanced web search at https://www.imdb.com/search/title/ to
access movie data.
2. Filter: Filter all titles with a rating between 2 and 8.
3. Format: For up to the first 25 titles, extract the necessary details: ID, title, year, and
rating. The ID of the movie is the part of the URL after tt in the href attribute. For
example, tt10078772. Organize the data into a JSON structure as follows:

[
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },
  // ... more titles
]

4. Submit: Submit the JSON data in the text box below.
```*



  
For this question, The answer which we get is not same as the expected answer which the portal fetch through proxy fetch  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays JavaScript code, likely used in a data science or web scraping context, specifically for extracting information from IMDb.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to fetch and parse data for movies or TV shows from IMDb's search results page based on a user-defined rating range. It extracts the IMDb ID, title, release year, and user rating for each item.
*   **Rating Range Swap:** The first line `r > n && ([n,r] = [r, n]);` ensures that `n` and `r` variables (likely representing a rating range, e.g., min and max rating) are ordered correctly, swapping them if `r` is initially greater than `n`.
*   **Asynchronous Function (`d`):** An asynchronous arrow function is defined, which handles the data fetching and parsing logic.
*   **Pre-filled/Cached Data (`s`):** The code checks `if (!s)` before attempting a network request. This suggests `s` might be a cached or pre-filled variable. Inside the function, the parameter `g` is immediately assigned a multi-line string containing a JSON-like structure for "The White Lotus", which might be sample data, a fallback, or a debugging remnant.
*   **Proxy Fetch:** The `fetch` request uses a `/proxy/` prefix in the URL (`/proxy/https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?user_rating=${r},${n}`), indicating that a proxy server is used, likely to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions or for anonymity.
*   **Error Handling:** It includes robust error handling for the `fetch` operation. If the HTTP response `h.ok` is false (e.g., a 4xx or 5xx status), it throws an `Error` message that includes the HTTP status code and status text.
*   **HTML Parsing:** Once the HTML content (`s`) is successfully fetched, `DOMParser` is used to parse the HTML string into a DOM document object.
*   **Data Extraction:**
    *   `querySelectorAll(".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item")` selects all relevant listing elements.
    *   A `map` function iterates over these elements (`h`).
    *   For each item, `querySelector` with specific CSS classes (`.ipc-title-link-wrapper`, `.ipc-title__text`, `.dli-title-metadata-item`, `.ipc-rating-star--rating`) extracts the following:
        *   `id`: Extracted from the `href` attribute of the title link wrapper, using a regular expression `/(tt\d+)/` to specifically capture the IMDb ID (e.g., "tt1234567").
        *   `title`: The text content of the element with class `ipc-title__text`.
        *   `year`: The text content of an element with class `dli-title-metadata-item`.
        *   `rating`: The text content of an element with class `ipc-rating-star--rating`.
*   **Output Structure:** Each extracted item is returned as an object `{ id: m, title: b, year: S, rating: w }` within the `map` function. The `l` variable stores the array of these parsed objects.
*   **Potential Anomaly:** The line `l = Array(25)` within the `map` callback is unusual. `l` is already the variable that will hold the result of the `map` operation. Assigning `Array(25)` to `l` inside the loop would overwrite the `l` variable on each iteration, likely leading to unexpected behavior or is a leftover debugging line.

**Transcribed Code:**

```javascript
r > n && ([n,r] = [r, n]);
let s, d = async g => { g = "\n {\n \"id\": \"tt13406094\",\n \"title\": \"1. The White Lotus\",\n \"year\": \"2021-\",\n \"rating\": \"8.0\"\n },\n {\n"
if (!s) {
    let h = await fetch(`/proxy/https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?user_rating=${r},${n}`);
    if (h.ok) {
        s = await h.text();
    } else {
        throw new Error(`I wasn't able to get the IMDB data to verify. Please try again. Response: ${h.status} ${h.statusText}`)
    }
}
let l = [...new DOMParser().parseFromString(s, "text/html").querySelectorAll(".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item")].map(h => { l = Array(25)
    let m = h.querySelector(".ipc-title-link-wrapper").getAttribute("href").match(/(tt\d+)/)[1]
    , b = h.querySelector(".ipc-title__text").textContent
    , S = h.querySelector(".dli-title-metadata-item").textContent
    , w = h.querySelector(".ipc-rating-star--rating").textContent;
    return {
        id: m,
        title: b,
        year: S,
        rating: w
    }

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do

* Remove unused libraries from your `requirements.txt`. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like `SentenceTransformers` can install large sub-dependency packages.
* Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
* Create a `.containerignore` file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
* Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you‚Äôve mentioned that for Github questions ‚Üí actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.

For GA2 Q9 ‚Üí I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive API documentation interface, likely generated by tools like Swagger UI or FastAPI's auto-generated docs. It shows details for a `POST` endpoint, how to interact with it, and the result of an executed request.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### API Endpoint Details

*   **Method**: `POST`

Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, presenting a task related to data analysis for talent acquisition and market research, likely using GitHub user data.

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The top section outlines three key benefits or applications of data analysis in recruitment:
    *   **Competitive Intelligence:** Staying updated on emerging developer trends to adjust talent acquisition strategies.
    *   **Efficiency:** Automating data collection to free up recruiters for relationship-building.
    *   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Using standardized data for strategic business decisions in recruitment and market research.
*   **Core Task:** The user is prompted to "Enter the date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z") when the newest user joined GitHub."
*   **Detailed Instructions for Finding the Date:**
    *   The user must perform a search using `location:` and `followers:` as filters.
    *   The search results should be sorted by `joined` date in descending order (to find the newest users first).
    *   From the first result, the `url` needs to be fetched (presumably to identify the user/record).
    *   The value of the `created_at` field from this record should be entered as the answer.
    *   **Crucial Exclusion:** "Ultra-new users" who joined *after* a specific date and time (`3/30/2025, 7:21:18 PM`) must be ignored. This implies filtering out very recent entries or perhaps a specific data snapshot being used for the exercise.
*   **Input Field:** An empty text field is provided for the user to enter the required date.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (as they appear):**

*   **Example Date Format:**
    `"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"`
*   **Search Parameters/Fields:**
    *   `location:`
    *   `followers:`
    *   `joined` (for sorting)
    *   `url` (to fetch)
    *   `created_at` (field to enter)
*   **Exclusion Date/Time:**
    `3/30/2025, 7:21:18 PM.`*



  
So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary?

> **Image Content:** *Upon careful analysis, it is immediately apparent that the image provided is **not** a screenshot originating from a data science course forum. Instead, it is a high-resolution digital rendering or piece of concept art depicting a futuristic cityscape.

Therefore, there is no key information, code, commands, or error messages relevant to a data science course forum to transcribe.

**Description of the Image (as a piece of art, not a forum screenshot):**

The image portrays a sprawling, vibrant, and highly stylized futuristic metropolis, likely at dusk or night, illuminated by an abundance of neon and glowing lights.

*   **Cityscape:** Dominated by numerous tall, sleek skyscrapers and architectural structures, many of which are adorned with vertical and horizontal lines of glowing blue, purple, and pink lights. The buildings have a high-tech, angular appearance.
*   **Transportation:** Elevated multi-lane highways or sky-bridges traverse the cityscape, glowing with vibrant magenta/purple and cyan/blue light trails, suggesting high-speed traffic. Several futuristic vehicles, resembling flying cars or spacecraft, are visible in the sky and on the illuminated roadways, leaving light trails.
*   **Color Palette:** The dominant colors are electric blue, vibrant magenta/purple, and pink, contrasting with the darker tones of the buildings and a warm, glowing horizon (sunset/sunrise effect).
*   **Atmosphere:** The overall impression is one of a bustling, technologically advanced, and visually striking urban environment, evoking science fiction themes.
*   **Absence of Forum Elements:** Crucially, there is **no** discernible user interface, text, code snippets, command-line outputs, error messages, data visualizations, or any other elements typically associated with an online educational forum or a technical computing environment.

**Key Information (from the image itself, unrelated to data science forum content):**

*   **Subject:** Futuristic cityscape / Sci-fi urban environment.
*   **Dominant Visuals:** Neon-lit skyscrapers, elevated glowing highways, flying vehicles.
*   **Color Scheme:** Predominantly electric blues, purples, and magentas.
*   **Artistic Style:** Digital art, concept art, possibly AI-generated.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **None.** There is no visible text, code, commands, or error messages present in the image.*

I am going to clarify this once and for all  
The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

```
{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }

```

This is the way we are expecting your responses.  
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don‚Äôt want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.  
So,

```
"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"

```

is also valid.

Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3

What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under **/telugu/** from **11:00** until before **20:00** on Mondays?

For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else‚Äôs solution; both give the same answer - **2698**

However, the portal says it‚Äôs incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.

Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.

My script:

```
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count

```

I had extracted and uploaded the `data` after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.

The other script:

```
import pandas as pd
import gzip
import re
import os
from datetime import datetime
import hashlib
from google.colab import files

# Function to compute SHA-256 hash
def compute_hash(text):

    match = re.match(log_pattern, line)
    if match:

        return pd.DataFrame()

    parsed_logs = []
    with gzip.open(file_path, 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in f:
            parsed_entry = parse_log_line(line)
            if parsed_entry:
                parsed_logs.append(parsed_entry)
    return pd.DataFrame(parsed_logs)

# Convert time format
def convert_time(timestamp):
    return datetime.strptime(timestamp, "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z")

df = load_logs(file_path)

if not df.empty:
    df["datetime"] = df["time"].apply(convert_time)
    df["day_of_week"] = df["datetime"].dt.strftime('%A')
    df["hour"] = df["datetime"].dt.hour

    # Filter conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df["method"] == "GET") &
        (df["url"].str.startswith("/telugu/")) &
        (df["status"] >= 200) & (df["status"] < 300) &
        (df["day_of_week"] == "Monday") &
        (df["hour"] >= 11) &
        (df["hour"] < 20)
    ]

    # Compute hash of the result
    result_hash = compute_hash(str(len(filtered_df)))

    # Output the count and hash
    print("Successful GET requests for /telugu/ on Mondays (11:00-7:59 AM):", len(filtered_df))
else:
    print("No log data available for processing.")

```

Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.

*March 31, 2025, 00:52 UTC*
can anyone help me ,  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an "Academic Verification" form, likely part of a process to confirm a user's student status for an offer or service (given the "Microsoft" mention at the bottom, it's possibly for a Microsoft student program like Azure for Students or Office 365).

The form is pre-filled with the user's name and school details, but there's a prominent warning indicating an issue with the initial verification method.

### Key Information:

*   **Purpose:** The form is for "Academic Verification," requiring personal and school details to verify a user's academic status.
*   **Current Status/Issue:** The user's entered email domain is "not currently registered," implying the primary automatic verification method failed.
*   **Action Required:** The user is prompted to "choose another verification method" due to the email domain issue.
*   **Required Information:** The form collects:
    *   First Name
    *   Last Name
    *   Country of school
    *   School Name
*   **Instructions:** Users are advised to enter details as per school records (name, date of birth - though date of birth field is not visible in this crop). The school-provided email address is important for verification contact.
*   **Regional Restrictions:** A note indicates that if the country is not listed, the offer might not be available in that region.
*   **Data Pre-filled:** The form already contains the user's first name, last name, country, and school name.

### Transcribed Elements:

**Error/Warning Message:**
`Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method.`

**Header:**
`Academic Verification`

**Instructions/Guidance Text:**
`Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address.`

**Form Labels and Pre-filled Values:**

*   **First name**
    *   `VIKASH`
*   **Last name**
    *   `PRASAD`
*   **Country**
    *   `India`
*   **Note under Country:**
    *   `If your country is not listed, the offer is not available in your region. Learn More`
*   **School name**
    *   `Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)`
*   **Note under School name (partially visible):**
    *   `School name will help provide Microsoft with additional information for verification. If available, please enter it here.`*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user interface element from what appears to be an account or profile management section of a data science course forum.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The screenshot shows a field for a user's "School email address," suggesting a mechanism for verifying or displaying a student's institutional affiliation within the forum. This is crucial for course forums to ensure only enrolled students or faculty have access to specific resources, discussions, or functionalities.
*   **Data Presented:** A specific school email address is populated in the text field.
*   **Contextual Clues:**
    *   The label "School email address" clearly indicates the type of information being handled.
    *   The email domain `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` strongly suggests an affiliation with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), specifically within a "study" program, likely related to "Data Science" (ds).
    *   The local part of the email, `21f3002277`, appears to be a student ID or enrollment number, possibly indicating the year of enrollment (21 for 2021) and a unique identifier. This type of identifier is common for student accounts in educational institutions.
*   **Absence of Errors/Commands:** The image does not contain any error messages, system commands, or executable code snippets. It simply shows a populated input/display field.

**Transcription:**

There are no code, commands, or error messages present in the screenshot. The only relevant text string that can be transcribed is the email address displayed:

`21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a configuration interface for **Inbound Port Rules** for a Virtual Machine (VM), likely within a cloud computing environment (such as Azure, AWS, or GCP). The purpose of this screen is to define which network ports on the VM are accessible from the public internet.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Title and Description:**
    *   The main title is "Inbound port rules".
    *   A descriptive text explains: "Select which virtual machine network ports are accessible from the public internet. You can specify more limited or granular network access on the Networking tab." This indicates that these are high-level settings and more detailed control is available elsewhere.

2.  **Public Inbound Ports Configuration:**
    *   **Label:** "Public inbound ports *" (The asterisk denotes a required field).
    *   **Information Icon:** An "i" in a circle next to the label suggests additional information or a tooltip is available.
    *   **Options:** Two radio buttons are presented:
        *   "None" (unselected) - This would block all public inbound traffic.
        *   "Allow selected ports" (selected) - This option is currently chosen, meaning specific ports will be opened.

3.  **Selected Inbound Port:**
    *   **Label:** "Select inbound ports *" (Again, an asterisk for a required field, conditional on "Allow selected ports" being chosen).
    *   **Dropdown Menu:** A dropdown box shows "SSH (22)" as the currently selected value. This indicates that the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which typically runs on port 22, is enabled for public access. The presence of a dropdown suggests other common ports (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, RDP) could be selected instead.

4.  **Security Warning Message:**
    *   A prominent warning box with an orange triangle and exclamation mark icon is displayed below the port selection.
    *   **Content:** "This will allow all IP addresses to access your virtual machine. This is only recommended for testing. Use the Advanced controls in the Networking tab to create rules to limit inbound traffic to known IP addresses."
    *   **Implication:** This warning is crucial. It explicitly states that by allowing "SSH (22)" with the current settings, the virtual machine will be exposed to connection attempts from *any* IP address on the public internet. It strongly advises against this for production environments and directs the user to "Advanced controls in the Networking tab" for implementing more secure, IP-restricted access.

**In summary, the screenshot shows a user configuring a Virtual Machine to allow public SSH access from anywhere on the internet, accompanied by a critical security warning highlighting the risks and suggesting a more secure approach for production use cases.***

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.  
For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.

So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.

Question ‚Äî> the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?

Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what‚Äôs taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.

Regards,

For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like <http://ip>:port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint?

q-vercel-python.json will be same or different?



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

This screenshot appears to be from a data science course assignment or forum post outlining a programming task. The task involves building and deploying a Python application as an API on Vercel.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Data Source:** Students are required to download a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`. This file contains "marks of 100 imaginary students."
2.  **Application Development & Deployment:** The core task is to "Create and deploy a Python app to Vercel."
3.  **API Specification:**
    *   **Endpoint:** The app must expose an API.
    *   **Request Format:** It should handle GET requests with query parameters for names, structured like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`. This implies the API should accept multiple `name` parameters.
    *   **Response Format:** The API should return a JSON response containing the marks corresponding to the requested names (X and Y) in the same order they were requested.
    *   **Example Response:** An example of the expected JSON output is provided: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.
    *   **CORS:** A crucial requirement is to "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin." This is important for enabling cross-origin requests to the API.
4.  **Submission/Validation:** The final part of the screenshot asks for the deployed Vercel URL, providing a template for its structure.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **File Name:** `q-vercel-python.json`
*   **Example API Request URL Structure:**
    `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`
*   **Expected JSON Response Body:**
    `{"marks": [10, 20]}`
*   **Example Vercel URL Structure (from prompt):**
    `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`
*   **Pre-filled Vercel URL (user's input/answer):**
    `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`*



Will the llamafile be same?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum outlines a series of steps and a question related to setting up and accessing a local language model server.

**Key Information:**

The content provides instructions for users to set up a local Large Language Model (LLM) environment and expose it externally.

1.  **Model and Tooling:** Users are instructed to download a "Llamafile" and then run a specific model, `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`, using the Llamafile framework. This suggests running a quantized version of a Llama-like model as a self-contained executable.
2.  **Network Tunneling:** The next step requires creating a public tunnel to the local Llamafile server using `ngrok`. This is a common practice for exposing local development servers to the internet for testing, demonstrations, or integration.
3.  **Question and Answer:** The final part asks for the `ngrok` URL generated, providing a typical format for `ngrok-free.app` domains, followed by a specific example URL which is likely the expected answer or a solution to the prompt.

**Transcribed Text:**

```
Download Llamafile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile model with it.

Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok.

What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/

https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app

hello i want to know about this currently I am using approach like you provide HTML page URL and my internal approach and run hidden value or you provide URL website



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive challenge from what appears to be an online data science or web development course, likely focusing on web technologies, web scraping, or browser developer tools.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** The user is tasked with finding a "secret value" contained within a "hidden input" element on the webpage.
2.  **Interface Elements:**
    *   **Instructions:** Two lines of text guide the user on the task.
    *   **Input Field:** An empty text input field is provided for the user to enter their discovered value.
    *   **Action Button:** A "Check" button is available, presumably to validate the entered value.
3.  **Implied Task:** To solve this challenge, a user would typically need to utilize browser developer tools (e.g., "Inspect Element") to examine the webpage's underlying HTML structure. They would then locate the hidden input field and extract its value attribute. This type of exercise is common in courses teaching web scraping, HTML DOM manipulation, or security fundamentals.

**Transcribed Text (Code, Commands, or Error Messages):**

There are no code, commands, or error messages present in the screenshot. All visible text is plain English.

*   **Text 1:** Just above this paragraph, there's a hidden input with a secret value.
*   **Text 2 (Question):** What is the value in the hidden input?
*   **Button Text:** Check*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a problem statement from what appears to be an interactive web development or web scraping exercise within a data science course.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** The user is being tested on their ability to select elements using CSS selectors.
2.  **Task Details:**
    *   **Target Elements:** Find all `<div>` elements.
    *   **Selection Criteria:** These `<div>` elements must have the class `foo`.
    *   **Location:** The elements are located within a "hidden element" which is not visible in the screenshot, implying the user needs to inspect the page's source code or DOM.
    *   **Calculation:** For all matching `<div>` elements, the user needs to find the sum of their `data-value` attributes.
3.  **Input/Output:**
    *   The prompt asks: "What's the sum of their data-value attributes?"
    *   A label "Sum of data-value attributes:" indicates where the answer should be provided.
    *   Below the label, there's an input field where the user is expected to type the calculated sum.
4.  **Interaction:** A "Check" button is present at the bottom, likely used to submit the answer and verify its correctness.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code blocks, command-line commands, or error messages displayed. However, the problem statement refers to specific HTML/CSS syntax elements:

*   **HTML Tag:** `<div>`
*   **CSS Class Name:** `foo`
*   **HTML Data Attribute:** `data-value`*

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information Description:

The screenshot displays a problem statement related to querying a SQLite database, specifically focusing on a `tickets` table.

1.  **Database Context:** The problem involves a `tickets` table stored in a SQLite database.
2.  **Table Structure:** The `tickets` table has three columns:
    *   `type`: Represents the type of ticket (e.g., "bronze", "Silver").
    *   `units`: Represents the number of units/tickets bid for.
    *   `price`: Represents the price per unit/ticket.
3.  **Data Description:** Each row in the `tickets` table corresponds to a customer bid for a concert ticket. The sample data provided shows that the `type` column might contain inconsistent casing (e.g., "bronze", "Bronze", "Silver", "SILVER").
4.  **Problem Question:** The user is asked to determine the "total sales" for a specific ticket type, "Gold". Total sales would typically be calculated as `units * price` for each bid of that type, summed up.
5.  **Task:** The specific instruction is to "Write SQL to calculate it."
6.  **Expected Input Area:** An empty dark gray box is present below the question, indicating where the SQL query should be entered or displayed.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There are no code, commands, or error messages present in the screenshot. The designated area for the SQL query is empty.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a data science course forum post, likely an example or a student's query regarding data aggregation and calculation. The core content revolves around summing a list of numerical values, identified as "complaints," and calculating a total.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Data Lists:** Two distinct lists of monetary values are presented. The first list appears to be a raw set of entries, while the second is a selected subset (or a refined list based on the first) explicitly used for the final calculation. All listed values are formatted with two decimal places (e.g., `.00`, `.30`) and use commas for thousands separation. Notably, all entries are prefixed with a hyphen, which, in the context of the subsequent summation, appears to function as a bullet point or an indicator rather than a negative sign, as the values are summed as positive numbers.
2.  **Aggregation Note:** One entry in the second list, `- 5,000.00`, is accompanied by a parenthetical note: `(total of subsequent similar entries)`, indicating that this value is itself an aggregation of other data points not explicitly shown.
3.  **Calculation:** The post explicitly demonstrates the summation of selected values to arrive at a total.
4.  **Context:** The final statement "the total value of complaints" clarifies the domain of the data, suggesting an analysis of customer complaints, financial claims, or similar quantifiable issues.
5.  **Potential Data Quality Issue (Formatting):** One large number, `20,03,030.00`, is initially presented with an Indian numbering system comma format (separating thousands as `xx,xx,xxx.xx` instead of `x,xxx,xxx.xx`). However, in the explicit summation line, this number is correctly formatted as `2,003,030.00` according to the standard Western numbering system. This inconsistency could be a point of confusion or an error in the original data source that a data scientist would need to address.
6.  **Critical Data Quality Issue (Calculation Error):** Upon manual verification, the sum stated (`2,073,684.00`) does not match the sum of the numbers listed in the summation equation.
    *   1,233.00 + 56,767.00 + 2,400.00 + 1,234.00 + 10,000.00 + 20.00 + 2,000.00 + 2,003,030.00 + 5,000.00 = **2,081,684.00**.
    *   The screenshot states the sum is **2,073,684.00**. This indicates an arithmetic error in the provided solution or example.

---

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
 - 2,400.00
 - 0.00
 - 1,234.00
 - 10,000.00
 - 20.00
 - 2,000.00
 - 0.00
 - 0.00
 - 20,03,030.00
 - 1,000.00
 - 1,000.00
 - 1,000.00
 - 1,000.00
 - 1,000.00

Now, let's calculate the total:

 - 1,233.00
 - 56,767.00
 - 2,400.00
 - 1,234.00
 - 10,000.00
 - 20.00
 - 2,000.00
 - 20,03,030.00
 - 5,000.00 (total of subsequent similar entries)

Summing these values:

1,233.00 + 56,767.00 + 2,400.00 + 1,234.00 + 10,000.00 +
20.00 + 2,000.00 + 2,003,030.00 + 5,000.00 = 2,073,684.00

Thus, the total value of complaints is **2,073,684.00**.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web service deployment dashboard, likely from a cloud platform such as Render. It shows the status and details of a project, possibly related to a data science course, named "TDS-Project-2".

Here's the key information:

**1. Web Service Overview:**
*   **Service Type:** `WEB SERVICE`
*   **Project Name:** `TDS-Project-2`
*   **Runtime/Language:** `Python 3`
*   **Pricing Tier:** `Free` (with an option to `Upgrade your instance ‚Üí`)
*   **Actions:** `Connect` (dropdown) and `Manual Deploy` (dropdown) buttons are available.

**2. Project Repository and Live URL:**
*   **Repository:** `23f3001764 / TDS-Project-2` (This appears to be a user/organization ID followed by the repository name).
*   **Branch:** The icon next to the repository indicates it's deployed from the `main` branch.
*   **Live URL:** `https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com` (This is the public-facing URL where the web service can be accessed, confirming the platform is Render).

**3. Free Instance Limitation Alert:**
*   A prominent purple banner warns:
    `Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more.`
*   An `Upgrade now` link is provided to address this.

**4. Current Deployment Status:**
*   **Timestamp:** `March 31, 2025 at 4:38 PM` (This is the timestamp for the current deployment activity).
*   **Status:** `In Progress` (The deployment is currently ongoing).
*   **Commit Details:**
    *   **Commit Hash (partial):** `5989351`
    *   **Commit Message:** `Final Commit`
*   **Action:** A `Cancel deploy` button (red) is available, suggesting the deployment can be interrupted.

**5. Logs Interface:**
*   A section for viewing logs is present with the following controls:
    *   **Log Filter:** `All logs` (dropdown, likely to select different log types).
    *   **Search:** A search bar to filter log messages.
    *   **Live Tail:** `Live tail` (with an icon resembling a lightning bolt), likely to view real-time log output.
    *   **Timezone:** `GMT+5:30` (the timezone for the displayed logs).
    *   **Navigation:** Up arrow and expand/maximize icons (likely for scrolling to top/bottom or expanding the log view).

**No specific code, commands, or error messages are transcribed as they do not appear in this screenshot. The "In Progress" status and informational alert are status messages, not error messages or commands.***



  
I have deployed the project on render so the first request in evaluation takes around 50 to 60 second is that okay

I deployed my API using Railway.app, but Jio ISP is blocking requests to `.up.railway.app`. I tested it with five other ISPs, and the API endpoint works perfectly. Could you please consider that some ISPs may be blocking certain domains?

I am facing this issue can any one help



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an error page from a web application hosted on Vercel, indicating a failure in a serverless function.

### Key Information:

1.  **Core Problem:** A "Serverless Function" has crashed. This implies a specific piece of backend code, designed to run on demand without a dedicated server, failed during execution.
2.  **Platform Status:**
    *   "Your connection is working correctly." ‚Äì This rules out any network issues on the user's end.
    *   "Vercel is working correctly." ‚Äì This indicates that the Vercel platform itself is operational, and the issue is specific to *this particular* function, not a widespread Vercel outage.
3.  **Error Type:**
    *   **HTTP Status Code:** `500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`. This is a generic server-side error, meaning something went wrong on the server that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
    *   **Vercel-specific Code:** `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`. This is a crucial detail, clarifying that the function was successfully deployed but failed during its *runtime execution* (when a request tried to invoke it).
    *   **Error ID:** `bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a`. This is a unique identifier for this specific error instance, vital for the developer to look up detailed logs on the Vercel dashboard.
4.  **User Guidance:**
    *   **For Visitors:** Advised to contact the website owner or try again later.
    *   **For Owners:** Directed to "learn how to fix the error" and, most importantly, to "check the logs." The error ID provided (bom1::...) would be used to find the specific logs that detail the function's crash (e.g., traceback, print statements, uncaught exceptions).

### Detailed Analysis and Context for a Data Science Course Forum:

This error is very common when deploying data science applications (like a machine learning model inference API, a data processing script, or a simple data visualization endpoint) as serverless functions.

*   **Likely Causes (within a data science context):**
    *   **Runtime Errors in Python/R Code:** The most probable cause. An unhandled exception occurred within the function's code (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, an issue with data types, or a bug in the model's prediction logic).
    *   **Missing Dependencies:** The `requirements.txt` (for Python) or `packrat` manifest (for R) might be incomplete, or a specific system dependency (like a BLAS library for NumPy/SciPy, or `libgomp` for scikit-learn/XGBoost) might be missing in the Vercel serverless environment.
    *   **Memory Limits Exceeded:** Data science models can be memory-intensive. If the function attempts to load a very large model or process a large dataset that exceeds Vercel's default memory allocation for serverless functions, it will crash.
    *   **Timeout:** The function took longer than the allowed execution time (e.g., 10 seconds for Hobby/Pro, 60 seconds for Enterprise plans on Vercel). This can happen with complex model inferences or long data processing tasks.
    *   **Incorrect Environment Variables:** If the function relies on API keys, database credentials, or model paths passed via environment variables, and these are misconfigured or missing, the function will fail.
    *   **External Service Failure:** The function might be trying to connect to a database, an external API, or a cloud storage bucket (like S3 or Google Cloud Storage) and failed to do so, leading to an unhandled exception.

*   **Troubleshooting Steps for the Owner (as suggested by the error page):**
    1.  **Check the Logs:** This is the absolute first step. The `ID` provided is critical. On the Vercel dashboard, navigate to the project, then to the "Functions" or "Logs" section, and search using this ID. The logs will reveal the exact traceback (e.g., Python stack trace) that led to the crash, pinpointing the problematic line of code.
    2.  **Review Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`) are listed in `requirements.txt` and that their versions are compatible with the serverless runtime.
    3.  **Optimize Code/Resources:** If memory or timeout is suspected, optimize the code for efficiency, consider serving smaller models, or explore Vercel's higher-tier plans for increased resources.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust `try-except` blocks (in Python) or similar error handling to gracefully manage potential issues and provide more informative error messages.

### Transcriptions:

*   `This Serverless Function has crashed.`
*   `Your connection is working correctly.`
*   `Vercel is working correctly.`
*   `500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`
*   `Code: `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED``
*   `ID: `bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a``
*   `If you are a visitor, contact the website owner or try again later.`
*   `If you are the owner, learn how to fix the error and check the logs.`*

PLEASE Sir, As I‚Äôm a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

Thank you

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don‚Äôt think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn‚Äôt provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don‚Äôt have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber‚Äôs Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.

Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don‚Äôt ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI‚Äôs or read whatever and wherever you want to read.

It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.

hi,

I dont share your views.

i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.

I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.

all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.

but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.

Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc‚Ä¶ At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify

for GA‚Äôs: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections

All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,

You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)

The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

23f2002668:

> What is this going on? Is it joking?

I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.

23f2002668:

> Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

23f2002668:

> I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.

Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

23f2002668:

> They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?

Yes these were explained if you

1. either took part in any live session or
2. watched the recorded video

23f2002668:

> And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?

I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

23f2002668:

> It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.

Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:  
Create a server api that receives a request.  
The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.  
The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.

Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.

23f2002668:

> Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?

Since this is your first post, you‚Äôve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.

If you want solutions, there are several options:

1. Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)
2. Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)
3. Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)
4. Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)

23f2002668:

> They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.

This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.

The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs‚Ä¶ with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

23f2002668:

> Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.

If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.

But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.

What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.

I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.

23f2002668:

> They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.

Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. **Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.** Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.

Now is a good time to start.

23f2002668:

> Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "

That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.

23f2002668:

> I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?

They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.

**Luckily for you,** our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).

23f2002668:

> The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.

If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.

23f2002668:

> In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?

Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.

But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.

You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.

23f2002668:

> It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.
>
> Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.

I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.

But thank you for your feedback.

One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.

And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

### Post #315 by **B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA** (ds-students)
*April 02, 2025, 12:44 UTC*
Hi, I have a few things to say

## My background :

I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

## My Initial Disappointments with this Course

In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):

> The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.

* Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn‚Äôt like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph
* ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.
* There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.

## Why did I fail?

### Last Term

I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn‚Äôt practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.

## This term.

I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn‚Äôt allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn‚Äôt submit both the projects.

In both the terms I didn‚Äôt collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.

## Me Understanding about the Course Now

This one line changed my view about ROE.

[On another topic](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/99838/2)

> **What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don‚Äôt know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.

I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.

Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.

In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.

This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an ***implicit*** way.

This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.

I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks

I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.

I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.

From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn‚Äôt do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn‚Äôt cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.

Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

> Just two suggestions

* I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.
* While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

Hello Carlton,

When are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2?  
I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. It is decreasing rapidly.

Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.

Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.  
Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi ‚Äì it gives errors like missing paramaters like‚Ä¶ So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

```
{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}

```

Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.



> **Image Content:** *The screenshot displays a user interface for interacting with an API endpoint, strongly resembling a Swagger UI or similar API documentation/testing tool. It is configured to send a request with specific parameters in the request body.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Top Navigation/Actions:**
    *   The active tab is "Parameters".
    *   Buttons are present for `Cancel` (red) and `Reset` (gray).

2.  **Parameters Section:**
    *   Below the active "Parameters" tab, the text `No parameters` is displayed, indicating that no URL query or path parameters are being configured for this request.

3.  **Request Body Section:**
    *   The section is clearly labeled `Request body` and marked as `required`, meaning a payload must be sent with the request.
    *   The content type for the request body is set to `multipart/form-data` via a dropdown menu. This typically indicates that the request involves file uploads or complex form data.

4.  **Input Fields within Request Body:**
    *   **`question` field:**
        *   **Name:** `question`
        *   **Type:** `string`
        *   **Requirement:** `* required` (meaning it's a mandatory field).
        *   **Value:** The input field contains the text: `Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single`
    *   **`file` field:**
        *   **Name:** `file`
        *   **Type:** `string | (string | null)($binary)` (This indicates it can be a string, null, or, most importantly, a binary file).
        *   **Value/Control:** A `Choose File` button is present next to the selected file name: `q-multi-cursor-json.txt`
        *   **Option:** A checkbox labeled `Send empty value` is present and **unchecked**, implying a non-empty file is intended to be sent.

5.  **Action Buttons:**
    *   A large blue button labeled `Execute` is available at the bottom to send the configured API request.
    *   A `Clear` button is also present next to `Execute`, likely to clear the response area.

6.  **Response Sections:**
    *   Headings for `Responses` and `Curl` are visible at the very bottom, but their content areas are currently empty, suggesting that the request has not yet been executed or a response has not been received.*



Correct output image ‚Äì  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "Server response" section, typical of what one would see after making an API request or submitting data in a web-based development environment, often found in online data science or programming courses.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Server Response Status:**
    *   **Code:** `200`
    *   **Details:** This is the standard HTTP status code indicating "OK" or "Success." It means the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

2.  **Response Body:**
    *   The primary content returned by the server is a JSON object.
    *   It contains a single key-value pair.
    *   The key is `"answer"`.
    *   The value is a long hexadecimal string, likely representing a unique identifier, a hash (e.g., MD5, SHA), an encoded result, or a token required for the next step in a task. Given the context of a data science course, this could be the correct answer to a coding challenge or a result to be used in subsequent operations.
    *   The response body is presented in a dark-themed text area, which is highlighted in blue, indicating it might be selected or ready for copying.

3.  **User Interface Elements:**
    *   Two buttons are visible at the bottom right of the response body area:
        *   An icon button (looks like a clipboard or sheet of paper with an arrow) which typically signifies a "Copy" action.
        *   A "Download" button, suggesting the user can download the response body content (e.g., as a JSON file).

4.  **Incomplete Information:**
    *   "Response headers" is visible below the response body, but the actual headers are cut off from the screenshot.

**Transcription of Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

The code visible in the "Response body" is a JSON object:

```
{
  "answer": "7a5955793fe63e199d0677d33f0053c50110d66589253280b1be96c598df24d8"
}
```*



Hope you get my point which i‚Äôm trying to convey sir.

The way we test your api is **not through a front end.**

We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.

We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.

As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.

Kind regards

Dear [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) and [@S.Anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand),  
I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel‚Äôs free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project‚Äôs size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.  
Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.

Hope that answers your question.

### Post #335 by **Carlton D'Silva** (Regular, ds-students)
*April 04, 2025, 06:17 UTC*
The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.  
Also the before deadline one end point is  
/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

# From Problem to Platform: Building ‚ÄúVicky‚Äù ‚Äì A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras

**Project Demo Website**: <https://app.algsoch.tech>

During our college course *Tool for Data Science (TDS)* at **IIT Madras**, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: **to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API**.

## The Mission:

Create a tool that behaves like a **chatbot**, accepts **user queries (text or file-based)** via **web or API**, processes them intelligently, **executes the appropriate code**, and returns accurate results‚Äîlike a real data science assistant.

---

## The Journey: From Fails to Final

At first, the natural choice was to try **LLM agents**‚Äîthey sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.

Then I thought‚Äîwhat if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files**, or queried in **non-standard formats** like ‚Äúcode -s‚Äù or ‚Äúcode -v‚Äù.

The next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1‚ÄìGA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.

---

## The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping

After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:

Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`  
Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution  
Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`  
Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more  
Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**

---

## Presenting Vicky ‚Äì The Mini Chatbot for TDS

Vicky is a **smart, modular chatbot** built specifically for **Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras**. It‚Äôs packed with real functionality‚Äînot just templates.

### Key Features:

**Graded Assignment Solver**  
Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:

* `code -s` / `code -v` ‚Üí VS terminal commands
* Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching
* GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup
* Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression

**File Upload with Query Matching**  
Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.

**HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder**

* View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy
* Upload Base64 string ‚Üí Get original image back

**Webhooks Integration**

* Live notifications via **Discord** & **Slack** whenever `/api` endpoints are accessed
* Monitors **server status (online/offline)** and sends real-time updates

**LLM Download + Auto Tunneling**

* Downloads LLaMA models
* Dynamically finds available ports
* Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints

**Live Web UI at [app.algsoch.tech](https://app.algsoch.tech)**

* Ask any TDS question
* Upload and query with files
* Image decoder
* Graded assignment slider navigation
* HTML viewer
* API health status

---

## Built With:

* **FastAPI** for blazing fast APIs
* **Regex & Pattern Matching** for dynamic input detection
* **GitHub Copilot** + my Python debugging and architectural thinking
* Full webhook and status monitoring system
* Modular backend (`vicky_server.py`) and web frontend (`vicky_app.py`)

I want to extend a huge thank you to [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) for their guidance on this project. I‚Äôve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won‚Äôt replace our jobs‚Äîespecially for those who understand programming‚Äîthey will create new job opportunities instead.  
Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,  
I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.  
I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.  
Thank you for your understanding

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini).

It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.  
We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

We hope this won‚Äôt be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.

Thank you  
Lakshay

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven‚Äôt resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a ‚Äú/‚Äù at the end and that‚Äôs it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven‚Äôt resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.

So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a terminal window showing log output from a Python application running on a server named "TDS". The logs detail incoming HTTP requests, their methods, paths, and response status codes, indicating ongoing web traffic, much of which appears to be automated scanning or probing.

**Key Information:**

1.  **System Context:** The prompt `azureuser@TDS:~$` indicates a user named `azureuser` logged into a system named `TDS`, likely a Linux-based virtual machine or server hosted on Azure.
2.  **Application Logs:** The lines are logs generated by a Python application (identified by `python[79249]`) on the `TDS` server. These logs capture HTTP requests received by the application.
3.  **Log Structure:** Each log entry typically contains:
    *   **Timestamp:** `Apr 05 HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `Apr 05 14:19:25`)
    *   **Logger Identifier:** `TDS python[79249]:` (server name, application/process, process ID)
    *   **Log Level:** `INFO:` or `WARNING:`
    *   **Client IP Address and Port:** (e.g., `162.243.238.100:0`). The `:0` for the port is unusual but consistent.
    *   **HTTP Request Details:** `"METHOD /path HTTP/VERSION"` (e.g., `"GET / HTTP/1.0"`).
    *   **HTTP Status Code:** (e.g., `200`, `404`, `405`).
    *   **Status Message:** (e.g., `OK`, `Not Found`, `Method Not Allowed`).
4.  **Observed Traffic Patterns:**
    *   **Successful Requests (200 OK):** Several requests for the root path (`/`) and `/favicon.ico` return `200 OK`, indicating basic functionality is accessible.
    *   **"Not Found" Errors (404 Not Found):** A large number of requests are for non-existent or common exploit/information disclosure paths:
        *   `/.env`: Attempts to access environment variable files, which can contain sensitive configuration.
        *   `/.git/config`: Attempts to access Git configuration files, potentially exposing repository details.
        *   `/autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@zdi/Powershell`: A highly suspicious request often associated with attempts to exploit Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover vulnerabilities or execute PowerShell commands. The `@zdi` might refer to Zero Day Initiative, often used in exploit strings.
        *   `/actuator/health`: A common Spring Boot Actuator endpoint, often scanned by attackers to identify Java applications.
        *   `/logincheck` (with `POST` method): Likely an attempt at credential stuffing or brute-forcing a login endpoint.
        *   `/t4`, `/teorema505?t=1`: Seemingly random or old paths often probed by scanners.
    *   **"Method Not Allowed" Errors (405 Method Not Allowed):** Multiple `PROPFIND /` requests are observed. `PROPFIND` is a WebDAV method often used by scanners to enumerate directories or check for WebDAV support, indicating the server doesn't support this method for the requested path.
    *   **Warning Message:** One specific entry `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.` indicates a malformed or unrecognized request was sent to the server.
5.  **Implications:** The logs strongly suggest that the "TDS" server is being actively scanned or probed by various IP addresses for common web vulnerabilities, misconfigurations (like exposed `.env` or `.git` files), and specific exploits (like the Exchange Autodiscover and login page attempts). This is typical behavior observed on internet-facing servers.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) I‚Äôm noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs‚Äîmostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure‚Äîtargeting sensitive paths like `/t4`, `/logincheck`, `/.env`, and `/.git/config`. These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??

Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?  
I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?

Maybe a helpful tip for next time

If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) I too faced the same issue, I received a bunch of hits from random ip addresses and it got shut down.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a server log, likely from a web application or API server, showing a series of incoming HTTP requests and server status messages, culminating in a graceful shutdown sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Observations:**
*   The log uses two primary levels: `WARNING` and `INFO`.
*   Most entries are related to incoming HTTP requests, indicating the source IP address and port, the HTTP method, the requested path, the HTTP version, and the server's response status code and message.
*   A recurring theme is `404 Not Found` for requested resources.
*   The log concludes with messages indicating a server shutdown.

**2. Key Information & Patterns:**

*   **HTTP 404 Not Found Errors:** A significant majority of the `INFO` messages show a `404 Not Found` status. This means the server could not find the requested resource.
    *   Many of these `404` errors are for common web application paths such as `/login.html`, `/admin/index.html`, `/index.html`, `/login.jsp`, `/doc/index.html`, `/remote/login.htm`, `/admin/login.asp`, `/web/`, `/webpages/login.html`, `/hudson`, and even hidden configuration files like `./env.bak` and `./env`.
    *   This pattern (requests for common login/admin paths and configuration files, resulting in 404s) is highly indicative of automated scanning or reconnaissance attempts by bots or potential attackers looking for vulnerable or exposed resources.
*   **"Invalid HTTP request received" Warnings:** Several `WARNING` messages state `Invalid HTTP request received.`. This suggests that some incoming requests were malformed or did not conform to the expected HTTP protocol, potentially indicating further attempts at probing or exploitation with non-standard requests.
*   **Diverse Request Sources:** The requests originate from a variety of different IP addresses (e.g., 104.234.115.27, 154.81.156.35, 114.33.166.218, 192.210.187.85, 221.144.32.29, 156.229.233.88, 106.71.57.84, 123.57.165.38, 172.172.245.91, 89.44.131.187). This diversity strengthens the hypothesis of widespread scanning activity rather than a single client's legitimate use.
*   **HTTP Methods:** Predominantly `GET` requests are seen, with one instance of a `POST` request (`POST /goform/set_LimitClient_cfg`).
*   **HTTP Versions:** Both `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/1.0` are present in the requests.
*   **Server Shutdown:** The log concludes with a clear sequence of server shutdown messages, indicating a controlled and successful termination of the application:
    *   `INFO: Shutting down`
    *   `INFO: Waiting for application shutdown.`
    *   `INFO: Application shutdown complete.`
    *   `INFO: Finished server process [1320]`

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn‚Äôt been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don‚Äôt know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.

[@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton), I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details:

```
{'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'}

```

This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

### Key Information

The screenshot displays a terminal window, showing a series of log entries followed by a command-line prompt. This indicates server activity and the readiness of the system for user input.

1.  **Server Logs:** The top six lines are log messages, likely generated by a web server or a Python application acting as a server, given the "python" process name.
    *   **Timestamps:** The logs show activities on "Apr 06". The first entry occurred at `10:10:28`, and a burst of five subsequent entries occurred at `11:08:19`.
    *   **Source Process:** All log entries originate from a process identified as `TDS python[79249]`.
        *   `TDS` likely refers to the hostname or a specific service.
        *   `python` indicates that the logs are from a Python application.
        *   `[79249]` is the Process ID (PID) of the Python application.
    *   **Log Level:** All entries are marked as `INFO:`, meaning they are informational messages, not errors or warnings.
    *   **Client IP Address:** All requests originate from the IP address `103.158.43.17`. The `:0` after the IP address is unusual for a port but might be an artifact of the logging format.
    *   **HTTP Requests:**
        *   The first log entry records a `GET` request for `/favicon.ico`. This is a common request made by web browsers to retrieve a website's favicon (small icon).
        *   The subsequent five log entries record `POST` requests to the `/api` endpoint. This suggests that data is being sent to an Application Programming Interface (API) on the server. The repeated `POST` requests within the same minute (11:08:19) might indicate a series of data submissions or operations.
    *   **HTTP Status:** All requests are noted as `HTTP/1.0` and returned `200 OK`, indicating that the requests were successfully processed by the server.
2.  **Command Prompt:** The last line shows a standard Unix/Linux shell prompt.
    *   `azureuser`: This is the username of the currently logged-in user. The prefix "azure" strongly suggests that the machine is hosted on Microsoft Azure.
    *   `@TDS`: This indicates the hostname of the machine, matching the `TDS` seen in the log entries.
    *   `~`: This symbol signifies that the current working directory is the user's home directory.
    *   `$`: This is the standard prompt character for a regular user (non-root) in a Bash-like shell, indicating that the system is ready to accept commands. The blinking cursor further confirms this.

In the context of a data science course, this screenshot could be part of a lesson on:
*   **Web Scraping/API Interaction:** Showing logs of a client (e.g., Python script) interacting with a data API.
*   **Server-Side Data Processing:** Demonstrating a Python application serving as a backend for data ingestion or processing.
*   **Cloud Computing:** Working with virtual machines or services hosted on platforms like Azure.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Understanding how to interpret server logs for debugging or performance analysis.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interaction with an API using an API client, likely Postman, showing a request being sent and the corresponding response received.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Request Details (Top Section):**

*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint URL:** `4.213.61.248:8080/api`
*   **Request Body Type:** `x-www-form-urlencoded` is selected. This means the request payload is sent as URL-encoded key-value pairs.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   A single key-value pair is active:
        *   **Key:** `question`
        *   **Value:** `what is output of -s?`
*   **Headers:** The "Headers (9)" tab indicates that 9 HTTP headers are being sent with the request (though their specific values are not visible).
*   **Action:** The "Send" button is visible, implying the request was just sent or is about to be.

**2. Response Details (Bottom Section):**

*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK`. This indicates that the request was successfully processed by the server.
*   **Response Time:** `5.00 s` (5 seconds). This is a significantly long response time for what appears to be a query for system information.
*   **Response Size:** `2.08 KB`
*   **Response Body Format:** `JSON` (selected in the dropdown).
*   **Response Body Content (Transcribed Exactly):**

```json
{
  "answer": "Version: Code 1.96.2 (fabdb6a30b49f79a7aba0f2ad9df9b399473380f, 2024-12-19T10:22:47.216Z)\\nOS Version: Darwin arm64 24.2.0\\nCPUs: 6\\nVM: Apple M1 (8 x 2400)\\nMemory (System): 8.00GB (0.09GB free)\\nLoad (avg): 2, 6, 0%\\nnScreen Reader: no\\nProcess Argv: --crash-reporter-id ca90dba9-1235-4414-b9a6-6a7e9b4e613b\\nGPU: canvas_oop_rasterization:\\nStatus: 2d_canvas: enabled\\ndirect_rendering_display_compositor: disabled_off_ok\\ngpu_compositing: enabled\\nmultiple_raster_threads: enabled_on\\nopengl: enabled\\nrasterization: enabled\\nraw_draw: disabled_off\\nskia_graphite: enabled\\nvideo_decode: enabled\\nvideo_encode: enabled\\nwebgl: enabled\\n"
}
```

**Analysis of the "answer" content:**

The value of the "answer" key is a single string containing various system details, likely formatted from a command-line utility's output. Key details include:

*   **Software Version:** `Code 1.96.2` with a specific commit hash and build timestamp (`2024-12-19T10:22:47.216Z`).
*   **Operating System:** `Darwin arm64 24.2.0` (indicating macOS on an Apple Silicon processor).
*   **CPU:** `6` cores.
*   **Virtual Machine/Hardware:** `Apple M1 (8 x 2400)`. This strongly suggests the system running the server is an Apple M1 Mac with 8 CPU cores.
*   **Memory:** `8.00GB` total system memory, with only `0.09GB free` (this indicates extremely low available memory, which could explain the slow response time or point to a memory leak/resource contention).
*   **Load Average:** `2, 6, 0%`
*   **Process Arguments:** `--crash-reporter-id ca90dba9-1235-4414-b9a6-6a7e9b4e613b`
*   **GPU Information:** Details about various rendering and compositing features (e.g., `2d_canvas: enabled`, `direct_rendering_display_compositor: disabled_off_ok`, `gpu_compositing: enabled`, `opengl: enabled`, `webgl: enabled`, etc.).

**Summary of the Problem/Context (for a data science forum):**

A user is querying an API endpoint `4.213.61.248:8080/api` using a POST request with the parameter `question=what is output of -s?`. The API successfully responds (200 OK) with system information, including details about an Apple M1 machine with `Code 1.96.2` running on it. The most notable observation is the **very long response time of 5 seconds** and the **extremely low amount of free memory (0.09GB)** reported in the response, which could be reasons for concern or topics for discussion in a data science or systems administration context. The "output of -s" question likely refers to getting this specific system diagnostic information.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a terminal output from what appears to be a development or data science environment, likely related to a project involving a large language model (LLM) and tool-calling capabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment Context:**
    *   The user is identified by an ID `23f2000599` within a `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` domain, suggesting a data science academic environment at IIT Madras.
    *   The current working directory is `~/tds-solver`, implying a project named "tds-solver".
    *   Embeddings were loaded from a cache file, indicating a system that uses pre-computed data for efficiency.

2.  **LLM and Tool Calling:**
    *   The system is interacting with a language model: `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`. This is a recent and compact version of OpenAI's GPT-4o model, indicating advanced AI capabilities.
    *   The LLM is configured with a "tool" or "function" named `solver_1`.
    *   **`solver_1` Function Description:** "Gives output of a specific command in VS code". It takes a single required parameter: `command` (a string). This means the AI can decide to execute shell commands within a VS Code context.
    *   **Tool Call Execution:** The LLM decided to call `solver_1` with the argument `{"command":"-s"}`. This implies the AI's intent was to run the command `-s`.
    *   **Finish Reason:** The interaction concluded because the model initiated `tool_calls`, not by generating a direct text response.

3.  **Usage and Cost Metrics:**
    *   The API interaction consumed:
        *   `prompt_tokens`: 63
        *   `completion_tokens`: 18
        *   `total_tokens`: 81
    *   Associated costs:
        *   `cost`: 0.000297 (likely USD for this specific interaction)
        *   `monthlyCost`: 0.007031520000004
        *   `monthlyRequests`: 34

4.  **Error Message:**
    *   A significant error is reported within the `costError` field: `'crypto.createHash is not a function'`. This suggests a JavaScript/Node.js environment where the `crypto` module's `createHash` function is either missing or incorrectly imported/used. This error likely pertains to the internal cost tracking or token hashing mechanism rather than the core LLM inference or tool execution itself, as the `finish_reason` was `tool_calls` and the HTTP request was `200 OK`.

5.  **API Call Success:**
    *   `INFO: 54.86.50.139:41710 - "POST /api HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` indicates that an HTTP POST request was successfully made to the `/api` endpoint on the server at `54.86.50.139:41710`, receiving a "200 OK" response. This confirms the network communication was successful, but the `costError` indicates an issue in the server's processing logic *after* receiving the request.

[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) - This is 24f1001631  
The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.  
I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.  
I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)‚Ä¶ but i fixed it.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an API client (likely Postman or Insomnia) interacting with a server. It shows a `POST` request being sent and the successful `200 OK` response received.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Request Details:**

*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint URL:** `104.211.116.95:8080/api`
*   **Request Body Type:** `form-data` is selected.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   A parameter named `question` is sent with the value: `Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or...` (the full value is truncated).
    *   A `file` parameter is also present but unchecked, meaning it's not being sent with this request.

**2. Response Details:**

*   **Status Code:** `200 OK` (Indicates a successful request).
*   **Response Time:** `3.86 s`
*   **Response Size:** `2.08 KB`
*   **Response Format:** `JSON`

**3. Transcribed Response Body (JSON):**

The response contains a single key-value pair, where the value associated with `"answer"` is a long string containing detailed system diagnostic information.

}
```

**Analysis of the "answer" content:**

The "answer" string provides extensive system information, which is unusual for a direct answer to a question like "Install and run Visual Studio Code." This suggests the API might be designed for diagnostics or debugging, or it returned a system status report instead of a specific answer.

Key details from the "answer" string:

*   **Version:** `Code 1.96.2` (This strongly suggests the server is running a component related to Visual Studio Code, perhaps a language server, an extension host, or a VS Code-based application).
*   **Build Info:** `fabdb6a30b49f79a7aba0f2ad9df9b399473380f, 2024-12-19T10:22:47.216Z` (Build hash and timestamp).
*   **Operating System:** `Darwin arm64 24.2.0` (macOS on an Apple Silicon M1/M2/etc. processor).
*   **CPU:** `Apple M1 (8 x 2400)` (An 8-core Apple M1 chip).
*   **Memory:** `8.00GB (0.09GB free)` (Total 8GB RAM with extremely low free memory, which could indicate a memory pressure issue or a very active system).
*   **GPU Status:** Detailed list of GPU-related features (2d\_canvas, canvas\_oop\_rasterization, direct\_rendering\_display\_compositor, gpu\_compositing, multiple\_raster\_threads, opengl, rasterization, skia\_graphite, video\_decode, video\_encode, webgl, webgl1, webgl2, webgpu) and their `enabled` or `disabled_off_ok` status.
*   **Process List:** Shows various processes with their CPU usage (0%), Memory (MB), PID, and Process Name. Notable processes include `code main`, `gpu-process`, and several `utility-*` services (network, audio, history, speech, sharing, media recorder, storage, webgpu).

**Overall Interpretation:**

The user is making an API call, possibly to a local or internal service running on an Apple M1 Mac. Instead of a textual answer to their query about installing VS Code, the API has responded with a detailed diagnostic report of the system it's running on, specifically highlighting the version and status of a "Code" application and various system resources. This could be intended behavior for a diagnostic endpoint, or it could indicate an unexpected response if the API was supposed to provide a knowledge-based answer. The very low free memory (0.09GB) might be a significant observation.*



ga5 q5  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an API call being made, likely from a tool like Postman or a similar API client, within the context of a data science course forum ("TDS-Project2-Testing-Again / ga5 / q5-working"). It demonstrates a successful interaction with a backend service.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Request Details:**
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **API Endpoint:** `104.211.116.95:8080/api`
*   **Request Body Type:** `form-data` is selected, indicating that the request is sending data as multipart/form-data, typically used for file uploads or complex data structures.
*   **Request Body Parameters:**
    *   **`question` (Text field):** `Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights` (The value is partially visible and appears truncated; the full value might be longer).
    *   **`file` (File field):** `q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json` (This indicates a JSON file is being uploaded. There's a warning/info icon next to the filename and a cloud upload icon, possibly indicating the file is ready to be sent or has just been selected).
*   **Headers:** The "Headers (9)" tab indicates that 9 headers are being sent with the request (though their content is not visible).

**2. API Response Details:**
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK` (Indicates a successful request).
*   **Response Time:** `3.68 s` (The time it took for the server to process the request and send back a response).
*   **Response Size:** `143 B` (The size of the response payload).
*   **Response Body Format:** `JSON` (The response is in JSON format).

**3. Transcribed Response Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "answer": "10887"
}
```

**Interpretation in a Data Science Context:**
This interaction strongly suggests an API designed to process a query or task related to data analysis. The user is submitting:
1.  A natural language question (or a query identifier) about "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights".
2.  A data file named "q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json".

The successful `200 OK` response with the JSON body `{"answer": "10887"}` implies that the backend service processed the question using the provided data and returned a numerical answer, "10887". This is characteristic of a system that might perform data query, analysis, or machine learning inference based on provided data and a specific question. The "10887" could represent a sales total, a count, or some other calculated metric derived from the "q-clean-up-sales-data.json" file in response to the "Sales Analytics" question.*

Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered?

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

thank you  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a terminal output, likely from a development environment such as VS Code (indicated by the "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL", "PORTS", "QUERY RESULTS (PREVIEW)", "COMMENTS" tabs, with "TERMINAL" active). It appears to be running an automated script or application, potentially part of a data science course or assessment system.

The core activity shown is the `tds_app` (likely an application related to "The Data Science") processing various "questions" by evaluating corresponding Python scripts (`.py` files). Each processed script is assigned a "score", suggesting an automated grading or performance evaluation system.

The questions themselves cover a range of data science tasks and scenarios:
*   Analyzing a startup's business ("LexiSolve Inc.").
*   Interacting with a SQLite database table ("tickets table").
*   Using an API for data retrieval ("Hacker News RSS API").
*   A scenario for a data analyst at a specific company ("DataSure Technologies").

The output also shows repeated HTTP `POST /ask` requests to a `github.io` domain, consistently returning a `200 OK` status, indicating successful communication with an external or internal service, possibly to fetch question prompts or submit results.

The file paths (`E://data science tool//GAx//<filename>.py`) suggest a structured course curriculum where "GAx" might denote "Graded Assignment" or "Group Assignment" followed by a number. The mention of `codeium-language-server.json` implies integration with an AI coding assistant or language server like Codeium.

**Key Information:**

*   **Application Name:** `tds_app`
*   **Purpose:** Automated processing and evaluation of data science questions/tasks using Python scripts.
*   **Evaluation Metric:** Each solution script receives a "score".
*   **Question Variety:** Covers business analysis, database interaction, API usage, and scenario-based data analysis.
*   **Environment:** Likely an integrated terminal within a development environment (e.g., VS Code).
*   **API Interactions:** Frequent successful `POST /ask` requests to `https://[USER].github.io`.
*   **Course Structure:** Files are organized into "GA" (e.g., GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5) directories within a "data science tool" path, indicating course assignments.
*   **Tools:** Potential integration with a language server (Codeium).

Hello,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.

Now that I‚Äôm back in Delhi, I‚Äôm connected to the internet, and I‚Äôm happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from a monitoring or diagnostic dashboard within a data science course environment, likely displaying system activity, recent queries, and critical API status.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. System Activity/Usage Statistics:**
*   **Total requests:** 39
*   **IP addresses:**
    *   `43.230.106.157`: 39 requests (indicating all requests originated from this single IP address).

**2. Recent Queries/Tasks:**
This section lists various scenarios or prompts, likely related to exercises or projects within the course:
*   `InfoCore Solutions is a technology consulting firm that maintains an extensive internal knowledge ba...` (This prompt is cut off, but suggests a task involving a knowledge base).
*   `Develop a FastAPI application that:` (This prompt is also cut off, indicating an API development task using FastAPI).
*   `Exposes a GET endpoint /execute?q=... where the query parameter...` (Describes an API endpoint structure, where `q` is a query parameter, likely for executing a command or search).
*   `Prompt to Yes` (A specific instruction or expected output).
*   `ESPN Cricinfo has ODI batting stats for each batsman. The result is paginated across multiple pages....` (Describes a data scraping or API integration task involving sports statistics and handling pagination).
*   `Source: Utilize IMDb's advanced web search at https://www.www.imdb.com/search/title/ to access movie dat...` (Provides a clear instruction for accessing movie data via IMDb's advanced search, including a specific URL).

**3. IMDb UI Element:**
*   A visual component labeled "IMDb" with an "Advanced search" link, and the large IMDb logo below it. This likely represents a functional link or a visual output related to the IMDb data task mentioned above.

**4. Critical API Status Alert:**
This is the most prominent and urgent information on the screen, highlighted in red:
*   **ALERT: API Status - 2025-04-07 13:01:32**
*   **Message:** `The API at app.algsoch.tech is currently DOWN or experiencing issues.`
*   **Details:**
    *   **API is DOWN**
    *   **Status: DOWN**
    *   **Last checked: 2025-04-07 13:01:32**

This indicates a critical service interruption for an API hosted at `app.algsoch.tech`, which was last checked and confirmed to be down at the specified timestamp. This status would directly impact any course activities or applications relying on this particular API.*

### Post #422 by **Shivaditya Bhattacharya** (ds-students)
*April 07, 2025, 20:14 UTC*
[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  
Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù and allows only POST requests.

1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  
   a. http://‚Ä¶/api/ ‚Üí resulted in 302 response  
   b. https://‚Ä¶/api ‚Üí resulted in a 307  
   whereas the url I gave was of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù

The logs from Cloud Run  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log of network requests, likely from a client-side application (indicated by "python-reque..." and "python-httpx...") interacting with a web API. The logs show a series of HTTP interactions, predominantly featuring redirect responses and method-not-allowed errors, with a single successful request at the very end.

### Key Information:

1.  **Timeframe**: The requests occurred on `2025-04-05` at approximately `23:51` (late evening), with a single successful request timestamped `2025-04-06 00:14`. This indicates a short, concentrated period of activity, possibly a script being run and debugged.
2.  **Request Types and Status Codes**:
    *   **`POST` requests with `302 Temporary Redirect` or `307 Temporary Redirect`**: Multiple `POST` requests to `http://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` (and sometimes implied `/api` without the trailing slash) result in redirects. This suggests the server is instructing the client to re-issue the request at a different (likely canonical) URL.
    *   **`GET` requests with `405 Method Not Allowed`**: Following many of the `POST` redirects, `GET` requests to `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` (with a trailing slash) consistently fail with a `405 Method Not Allowed` error. This is a critical observation, indicating that the API endpoint at `/api/` does not support the `GET` HTTP method, likely expecting a `POST` method instead.
    *   **`INFO` messages**: Interspersed `INFO` messages provide more detail about the HTTP request/response, often showing the full HTTP request line (e.g., `"POST /api HTTP/1.1"` or `"GET /api/ HTTP/1.1"`) and the local IP/port (`169.254.169.126:XXXXX`) involved in the connection.
    *   **`POST` request with `200 OK`**: The final entry in the log shows a successful `POST` request to `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` with a `200 OK` status, indicating that the correct method and path combination was eventually found or implemented.
3.  **Client**: The requests are originating from Python, indicated by `python-reque...` (likely the `requests` library) and `python-httpx...` (likely the `httpx` library). This points to a Python script being used to interact with the API.
4.  **Endpoint**: The target API endpoint is `tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`. The presence or absence of the trailing slash `/` in `/api` vs. `/api/` appears to influence the redirect behavior or the accepted method.

**Summary of the Problem Indicated**:
The primary problem illustrated by these logs is a mismatch between the HTTP method being used by the Python client and the methods supported by the API endpoint. Specifically, the API endpoint at `http://.../api/` seems to primarily accept `POST` requests, but the client is frequently attempting `GET` requests (possibly as a result of misinterpreting redirects or an incorrect implementation of API calls), leading to `405 Method Not Allowed` errors. The trailing slash also appears to be significant in how the server handles requests and redirects. The successful `200 OK` for a `POST` to `/api/` suggests that this is the correct way to interact with the API.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages Exactly as They Appear:

**Full Log Entries (selected examples due to repetition):**

*   `2025-04-05 23:51:12.872 INFO: 169.254.169.126:49510 - "POST /api HTTP/1.1" 307 Temporary Redirect`

*   `2025-04-05 23:51:14.246 GET 405 140 B 1 ms python-reque... https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`
*   `2025-04-06 00:14:41.329 POST 200 156 B 509 ms python-httpx... https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`

**HTTP Status Messages / Errors:**

*   `302 Temporary Redirect`
*   `307 Temporary Redirect`
*   `405 Method Not Allowed`
*   `200 OK`

**HTTP Methods and Paths Observed in INFO messages:**

*   `"POST /api HTTP/1.1"`
*   `"GET /api/ HTTP/1.1"`

**URLs / Endpoints:**

*   `http://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`
*   `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`
*   `169.254.169.126:49510` (and various other port numbers such as `63834`, `49512`, `55644`, `49514`, `55646`, `55652`, `19550`, `49516`)

**Client Identifiers:**

*   `python-reque...`
*   `python-httpx...`*



As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with ‚Äú/api‚Äù instead of ‚Äú/api/‚Äù, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a submission form for "TDS Project 2," a course project expected to be completed by January 2025, likely part of a Data Science curriculum. The form is designed to collect key deliverables from students for evaluation.

**Key Information:**

*   **Form Title:** `TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025`
*   **Login Requirements:**
    *   Users are required to log in with an `iitm.ac.in` email ID or a "work email ID." This suggests the course is affiliated with IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras).
*   **Submission Rules:**
    *   `You can submit only one response.`
    *   `You can correct your response after you submit.`
*   **Submitter's Identity:**
    *   The email recorded for this submission is `22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This confirms the specific student who submitted the form.
*   **Project Component 1: GitHub Repository Link**
    *   **Question:** `What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *` (The asterisk indicates it's a required field.)
    *   **Format Hint:** `It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`
    *   **Submitted Link:** `https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds_p2` (This is the specific GitHub repository where the student's project code is located.)
*   **Project Component 2: API Endpoint Link**
    *   **Question:** `What is the link to your API endpoint? *` (Required field.)
    *   **Technical Requirement/Command:** `Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL` (This is a crucial instruction, indicating that the submitted API endpoint must be able to receive and process POST requests, likely for model inference or data submission as part of the data science project.)
    *   **Submitted Link:** `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` (This is the specific URL for the student's deployed API endpoint. The `run.app` domain suggests it might be hosted on Google Cloud Run or a similar serverless platform.)*



I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

1.  **Nature of the Issue:** This is a browser-level error indicating a webpage failed to load or render properly. The "Aw, Snap!" message is characteristic of Google Chrome (or other Chromium-based browsers).
2.  **Root Cause:** The explicit error code provided is "Out of Memory". This means the browser tab or process attempted to allocate more Random Access Memory (RAM) than was available to it, leading to its crash or inability to display the content.
3.  **Contextual Implications for Data Science:**
    *   **Heavy Web Application:** The user might be trying to access a memory-intensive web application commonly used in data science, such as:
        *   A JupyterHub or Google Colab notebook with a large dataset or complex output.
        *   A web-based IDE that's loading many files or running computations in the browser.
        *   A dashboard or visualization tool displaying very large charts or tables.
    *   **System Resource Exhaustion:** The user's computer might generally be low on available RAM, possibly due to other applications (e.g., local Python environments, large datasets loaded into memory outside the browser, other browser tabs) consuming significant resources.
    *   **Browser-Specific Memory Leak/Inefficiency:** Less likely, but possible, is a specific issue with the browser version or extensions consuming excessive memory for the page being viewed.
4.  **User Actionable Item:** The "Learn more" link suggests there's additional information from the browser vendor (Google) about troubleshooting "Aw, Snap!" errors, particularly those related to memory.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Main Headline:**
    Aw, Snap!
*   **Description:**
    Something went wrong while displaying this webpage.
*   **Error Code/Message:**
    Error code: Out of Memory
*   **Link Text:**

This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.

Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Vercel deployment's log and invocation details, specifically showing a **Gateway Timeout (504)** error for a serverless function.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Primary Error & Request Overview:**
*   **Request Time:** April 9, 00:11:06.94
*   **Method:** POST
*   **Status Code:** **504 Gateway Timeout**
*   **Domain:** `tds-ga-proj2.ve...` (likely `tds-ga-proj2.vercel.app`)
*   **Endpoint:** `/api/` (This is the public API route).
*   **Previous Request:** There was a `POST` request at `00:11:00.79` to `/api` which resulted in a `307 Temporary Redirect`, likely to `/api/`.

**2. Function Invocation Details (for the 504 error):**
*   **Function Status:** `Gateway Timeout 504`
*   **Route:** `/main.py` (This is the specific Python file invoked by the `/api/` endpoint).
*   **Location:** Washington, D.C., USA (iad1)
*   **Runtime:** üêç `Python 3.12`
*   **Execution Duration / Maximum:** `10s / 10s` (The function ran for the absolute maximum allowed time, indicating it timed out).
*   **Memory Used / Maximum:** `214 MB / 1024 MB` (Memory usage was well within limits and not the cause of the timeout).
*   **Response Status:** `Response finished` (This indicates Vercel finished processing and sending the 504 response, not that the function successfully completed).

**3. Vercel Function Logs (3 Total Logs):**
The logs reveal why the function likely hung and timed out:
*   **`00:11:07.064 Email ID 23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`**
    *   This log suggests initial processing or identification of an email.
*   **`00:11:07.112 Email updated in index.html`**
    *   This log indicates that some content related to the email was written or updated in a file named `index.html`.
*   **`00:11:07.149 ‚ùå Failed to trigger workflow: 401 - {"message":"Bad credentials", "documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest", "status":"401"}`**
    *   This is the critical internal error. It occurred very early in the function's execution (less than a second after the request started at 00:11:06.94).
    *   The function attempted to trigger a workflow, but received a `401 Unauthorized` status from the GitHub API (`https://docs.github.com/rest`), specifically citing `"Bad credentials"`.

**4. Deployment Information:**
*   **Deployment ID:** `dpl_EFXAUNYSadoksLSImpbqCo5jo...` (Partial ID shown).
*   **Environment:** `production` (Indicates this is a live deployment).

---

**Summary of the Problem:**
The Vercel function, hosted on `tds-ga-proj2.vercel.app` and running `/main.py` with Python 3.12, is timing out after exactly 10 seconds (504 Gateway Timeout). The logs reveal that the function encountered an error very early in its execution: it failed to trigger a workflow due to a `401 Unauthorized` error ("Bad credentials") when attempting to interact with the GitHub API. Despite this internal error, the function did not terminate gracefully but instead hung for the remaining duration of the maximum execution time (approximately 9.8 seconds), eventually leading to the Vercel platform timing it out. The root cause of the timeout is the unhandled or poorly handled "Bad credentials" error with the GitHub API.

---
**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   `POST 504`
*   `POST 307`
*   `Gateway Timeout 504`
*   `/main.py`
*   `Python 3.12`
*   `10s / 10s`
*   `214 MB / 1024 MB`
*   `Email ID 23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   `Email updated in index.html`
*   `Failed to trigger workflow: 401 - {"message":"Bad credentials", "documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest", "status":"401"}`*



  
Hello [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) , [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,  
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,  
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,  
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec ‚Ä¶ and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??  
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,  
You can check its working from interface too  
Please check once !!

[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir today I received this email  



> **Image Content:** *Here's the analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This is an important announcement from the administrators of a data science course, specifically concerning **TDS Project 2**.

1.  **Ongoing Evaluation Checks:** The course team is still conducting checks on the server endpoints for TDS Project 2, contrary to previous communication that implied evaluations were complete.
2.  **Action Required from Learners:** Learners who have turned off their server endpoints because they believed evaluations were finished are explicitly asked to **turn them back on**.
3.  **Apology for Inconvenience:** The team apologizes for the inconvenience caused by this delay and the need for learners to reactivate their endpoints.
4.  **Awareness of Resource Consumption:** They acknowledge that keeping the endpoints running consumes credits on platforms like Azure and other resources for learners.
5.  **Future Communication:** Learners will be notified via subsequent emails once their evaluation is definitively complete, at which point they can turn off their endpoints to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.

**Transcription:**

Dear Learner,

**Please do not ignore this important announcement.** We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2.

If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, **please turn them back on.**

We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on azure and other platforms to keep them up and running.

We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary.

Kind regards*



  
I have did not turned it off it is just that the first request take time of 50 to 60 sec as you can see in the image.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a successful API call within an API development environment, most likely Postman, given its distinct user interface.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Request Details:**
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** The URL is partially obscured but starts with `https://tds-pro...`
*   **Tabs:** The "Params" tab is active, showing "Query Params". The "Body" tab has a green dot, indicating that a request body was sent, although its content is not visible in this specific view.
*   **Query Parameters:** No query parameters are defined ("Key" and "Value" fields are empty placeholders).
*   **Headers:** The request included 9 headers (`Headers (9)`).

**2. Response Details:**
*   **Response Tabs:** The "Body" tab is active, showing the response content. "Pretty" view is selected for the JSON response.
*   **Status Code:** `Status: 200 OK` (Indicates a successful request).
*   **Response Time:** `Time: 53.13 s` (This is a relatively long response time, suggesting the operation might be complex or involve significant processing).
*   **Response Size:** `Size: 361 B`
*   **Response Headers:** The response included 12 headers (`Headers (12)`).

**3. Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Response Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "140"
    }
    ```
*   **Status Message:** `Status: 200 OK`
*   **Time Taken:** `Time: 53.13 s`
*   **Response Size:** `Size: 361 B`

**Summary:**
The screenshot shows a successful `POST` request to an API endpoint (likely related to "tds-pro"). The API returned a `200 OK` status, indicating the operation completed without issues. The response body is a JSON object containing a single key-value pair: `"answer": "140"`, suggesting the API processed a request and returned a calculated result. The long response time (53.13 seconds) is notable and might be a point of interest for optimization or further investigation in a data science context, especially if this API is part of a larger data pipeline or model inference.*



  
and it also take same time in linux  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a successful interaction from a terminal session, likely demonstrating or verifying knowledge of Google Sheets formulas as part of a data science course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Environment:**
*   The user is `sahil` logged into a machine named `DESKTOP-N2T75TO`.
*   The current working directory is the user's home directory (`~`).
*   The interface is a command-line terminal (likely Linux, WSL, or Git Bash due to the prompt structure).

**2. Command Issued:**
The user executes a `curl` command, which is a tool for transferring data with URLs.

*   **Command:** `curl -X POST "..." -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "question=Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10)) What is the result?"`
*   **Method:** `-X POST` specifies that this is an HTTP POST request.
*   **URL:** `"..."`: The specific API endpoint URL is obscured, but it ends with `/api/`, suggesting it's interacting with a web service.
*   **Header:** `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"` indicates that the data being sent is in the format of a multi-part form, commonly used for file uploads or complex form data.
*   **Form Data:** `-F "question=..."`: This sends a form field named `question` with the following value:
    *   **Question Content:** "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10)) What is the result?"
        *   This question specifically tests the user's ability to interpret and calculate the result of a Google Sheets formula.
        *   It explicitly notes that the formula **will not work in Excel**, highlighting features specific to Google Sheets (like `SEQUENCE` and `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN`).
        *   **The Google Sheets Formula:** `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10))`
            *   `SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2)`: Generates a 100x100 array. It starts at `5`, and increments by `2` for each subsequent number. The first row would be 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, ...
            *   `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(..., 1, 10)`: This function constrains the generated array to 1 row and 10 columns. So, it extracts the first 10 numbers from the first row of the sequence: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23.
            *   `SUM(...)`: This sums the constrained array. The sum of 5+7+9+11+13+15+17+19+21+23 equals 140.

**3. API Response:**
Immediately after the `curl` command, the terminal displays the response from the API:
*   `{"answer":"140"}`
    *   This is a JSON object containing a single key-value pair.
    *   The `answer` key has the value `140`, which correctly matches the calculated result of the Google Sheets formula provided in the question.

**4. Subsequent Prompts:**
*   `sahil@DESKTOP-N2T75TO:~$`
*   `sahil@DESKTOP-N2T75TO:~$`
These lines indicate that the `curl` command executed successfully and returned control to the user, ready for the next command. There are no error messages, confirming a successful interaction with the API.

**In summary:** This screenshot demonstrates a user successfully submitting a Google Sheets formula question to an API (likely an automated grading or interactive learning system) and receiving the correct answer (`140`) back, indicating that either the user correctly provided the answer (if it was an answer submission) or the system successfully evaluated the provided question.*



  
**Please allow some time for my server hosted on Render to initialize, as it may take a moment to become fully active.**

Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%  
We have learned so many things and try to implement in it too,‚Ä¶

Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade ‚Ä¶ and our CGPA doesn‚Äôt decrease much  
because projects hold the major chunk in grading

sir my roll number is 23f2004462

Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok‚Äôs paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

*   **Sender:** `22t1 se2002` (signed off as `TDS Team`)
*   **Recipient:** The email was sent as BCC to the user (`to bcc: me`), indicating a mass announcement to multiple learners.
*   **Timestamp:** Sent `2:28 AM (18 hours ago)` relative to when the screenshot was taken.
*   **Core Message:**
    *   Evaluations for the recipient's Project 2 endpoints have been **successfully completed**.
    *   **Crucial Instruction:** Learners are now permitted to **switch off their server**. This implies that ongoing server resources (likely for endpoint testing or continuous operation) are no longer required for evaluation.
    *   **Next Steps:** The overall score for Project 2 will be released once *all other evaluations* (presumably for other students) are completed.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code snippets, command-line instructions, or error messages present in the screenshot. The bolded phrase "You may switch off your server now" is a natural language instruction, not a technical command to be transcribed.*



  
I have received this message do this message suggest that my evaluation is successfully completed coz I forgot to add /api at the end of my vercel url . Or is it like the submission had ran but ultimately produced my score 0. If this is the case I request you to reevaluate my submission.

Respected Course Team,

Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

### Key Information:

This screenshot displays an email from the "TDS Team" (likely an abbreviation for the "The Data Science" course or similar), specifically regarding Project 2.

The core message is an **urgent instruction** for students to re-enable their server endpoints for Project 2 evaluations. It appears there was a previous communication indicating evaluations were complete, leading some students to turn off their servers. However, the team is still conducting "some checks on the server endpoints," and thus requires the servers to be active again.

The email also conveys an apology for the inconvenience caused and expresses awareness that students might be consuming credits on platforms like Azure by keeping their servers running. The team aims to complete the evaluations as quickly as possible and promises to notify students via email once their individual evaluation is complete, at which point they can turn off their servers again.

Dear Learner,

**Please do not ignore this important announcement.** We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2.

If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, **please turn them back on.**

We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on azure and other platforms to keep them up and running.

We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary.

regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel  
<https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app>  
and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : <https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/>

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don‚Äôt want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Hello sir  
can you check and say if my server has been evaluated or not ?  
My roll no : 23f3003871

My endpoint is working smoothly, I am showing it to you in this photo.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook, likely part of a data science or programming assignment, demonstrating how to interact with an external API for data processing. The screen shows a Python script, its execution output, and some browser-level messages.

The screen has some noticeable scratches and glare, particularly in the middle, which makes some characters slightly harder to discern, but the content is largely legible with the aid of the provided crops.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** The code is running within a Google Colaboratory (`colab.research.google.com`) notebook titled `Untitled79.ipynb`.
2.  **Connectivity Warning:** A message at the top indicates "Connect to the reCAPTCHA service. Please check your internet connection and reload to get a reCAPTCHA challenge," suggesting a potential network or security check issue with Colab, though the code appears to have executed successfully despite this warning.
3.  **API Interaction:** The Python script is designed to make a `POST` request to an external API endpoint: `https://tds-project-2-ruby.vercel.app/api/`.
4.  **Input Data:**
    *   The request sends a local file named `q-unicode-data.zip` which is opened in binary read mode (`'rb'`).
    *   It also sends a dictionary `data` containing a `question` string.
5.  **Problem Statement (from `question` parameter):** The API is tasked with:
    *   Downloading and processing the contents of `q-unicode-data.zip`.
    *   The zip file contains three specific files with different encodings:
        *   `data1.csv`: CSV file encoded in CP-1252
        *   `data2.csv`: CSV file encoded in UTF-8
        *   `data3.txt`: Tab-separated file encoded in UTF-16
    *   Each of these files has two columns: "symbol" and "value."
    *   The objective is to "Sum up all the values where the symbol matches `<` OR `≈†` OR `>` across all three files."
6.  **Code Execution & Output:**
    *   The script uses the `requests` library to send the POST request.
    *   It prints the HTTP status code of the response and the response text.
    *   The output shows a `200` status code, indicating a successful request.
    *   The response text is a JSON object: `{"answer":39961}`, which provides the calculated sum as required by the question.

Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed?

PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.

Dear Sirs,

Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down.  
Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exercise‚Ä¶

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  
I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.  
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with ‚Äú/api/‚Äù but every POST request was either made to ‚Äú/api‚Äù which resulted in a 307 response or with ‚Äúhttp‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhttps‚Äù which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the Google Cloud Run logs for a service named `tdsproject2shiva`, deployed in the `asia-south1` region. The logs indicate the startup, health, and operational activities of a Python-based web application, likely a data science model served via an API.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform and Service:**
    *   **Platform:** Google Cloud Run.
    *   **Service Name:** `tdsproject2shiva`.
    *   **Region:** `asia-south1`.
    *   **Service URL:** `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app`.

2.  **Application Type and Startup:**
    *   The application is written in Python, suggested by `python-httpx` and `python-requests` client agents in the logs.
    *   It uses `Uvicorn` as a web server, implying it might be a FastAPI or Starlette application.
    *   Startup logs confirm the server process started and application startup was complete.
    *   Internal `Default STARTUP TCP probe succeeded` indicates the container successfully started and was listening on its designated port (8080).

3.  **Application Functionality (Inferred from logs):**
    *   The application seems to process "questions" and involves "embeddings" (common in NLP/ML contexts).
    *   It handles imports related to its functionality and also specifically mentions "cors imports" and "cors added," indicating Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured.
    *   The primary interaction path appears to be an `/api` endpoint.

4.  **Operational Status and Errors:**
    *   **Initial Success (April 8th/9th):** Logs show successful `POST 200 OK` on `/api/` (with a trailing slash) and successful application startup.
    *   **Redirects (April 8th, 11th):** Frequent `POST 307 Temporary Redirect` and `POST 302 Found` responses are observed. These redirects often point to the same URL or a slightly different variant (e.g., adding/removing a trailing slash).
    *   **Critical Errors (April 11th):** The most prominent issue is repeated `GET 405 Method Not Allowed` errors. These errors occur when a client attempts a `GET` request on an endpoint (`/api/`) that only supports other methods (like `POST`).
        *   It's possible that the client, after receiving a `307` or `302` redirect from an initial `POST` request, follows the redirect with a `GET` request (which is a common behavior for some HTTP clients, including `python-requests` when `allow_redirects=True`). If the `/api` endpoint is designed to *only* accept `POST` requests for its primary function, this would lead to a `405` error.

5.  **Log Details:**
    *   **Severity:** Logs show "Info" (`i`), "Default" (`*`), and "Warning" (`!`) severities. The 405 errors are flagged as "Warning."
    *   **Timestamps:** Logs span from April 8th to April 11th, 2025 (IST timezone). There's a gap between April 9th startup and April 11th errors.
    *   **Client Agents:** `python-httpx/0.28.1` and `python-requests/2.32.3` are observed making requests.
    *   **Internal IP:** `169.254.169.126` appears frequently, indicating internal Cloud Run network calls or probes.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages (exactly as they appear):**

*   **Commands/Informational Messages:**
    *   `processing question`
    *   `trying to load`
    *   `loaded embeddings`
    *   `INFO: Started server process [2]`

I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me. I gave the exact url as asked in the form.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from a mobile device displaying an email or a message within a form submission interface, likely related to a data science course or project. It's asking for project submission details.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Context:**
The interface shows typical email/messaging app elements like navigation arrows, action icons (download, trash, mail), and reply/forward buttons. The content itself is structured like a questionnaire or submission form. The presence of "Google Form" hints that this might be an email notification related to a Google Form, or an embedded form itself.

**Key Information & Transcriptions:**

1.  **GitHub Repository Link:**
    *   **Type:** URL
    *   **Content:**
        ```
        https://github.com/
        RichPerspective007/tds_p2
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This is a direct link to a GitHub repository. `RichPerspective007` is likely the username/organization, and `tds_p2` probably stands for "The Data Science Project 2" or similar, aligning with a data science course context.

2.  **API Endpoint Question and Instructions:**
    *   **Type:** Question and Instruction
    *   **Content (Question):**
        ```
        What is the link to your API
        endpoint? *
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** The asterisk `*` indicates that this is a required field.
    *   **Content (Instruction):**
        ```
        Make sure we can send a POST
        request to this exact URL
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** This is a crucial instruction, specifying that the submitted API endpoint must be able to receive HTTP `POST` requests and that the URL must be precise. This implies a need to test the API's functionality.

3.  **Provided API Endpoint URL:**
    *   **Type:** URL (answer to the question)
    *   **Content:**
        ```
        https://tdsproject2shiva-
        962709320549.asia-south1.run.
        app/api/
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This URL is likely a deployed API endpoint.
        *   `tdsproject2shiva`: Suggests "The Data Science Project 2" belonging to a user or project named "shiva".
        *   `962709320549`: Appears to be a unique identifier or part of a deployment name.
        *   `asia-south1.run.app`: Indicates deployment on Google Cloud Run in the `asia-south1` (Mumbai, India) region.
        *   `/api/`: The specific API path.

4.  **Google Form Related Prompts:**
    *   **Type:** Information/Security Prompts
    *   **Content:**
        ```
        Create your own Google Form
        Does this form look suspicious? Report
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** These lines suggest the underlying platform for this interaction is Google Forms, and it includes a standard security prompt for users to report suspicious content.

**In summary, the screenshot displays a form-based interaction, likely a project submission or evaluation for a data science course. It collects a GitHub repository link and crucially, an API endpoint URL with specific instructions for its accessibility (must accept POST requests). The form itself appears to be hosted via Google Forms.***

Hello sir,  
I apologize for bothering you again.  
About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system‚Äôs evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.  
i closed my local machine too I spent one month on this project please consider my problem



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the successful execution of a Python script in a PowerShell terminal, likely as part of a data science or systems analysis exercise. The script appears to be analyzing access logs or similar data to identify unique IP addresses and their access patterns to a specific API endpoint.

**Key Information:**

*   **Environment:** PowerShell (indicated by `PS` prefix and prompt structure).
*   **Current Directory:** `E:\data science tool\main\grok`
*   **Script Purpose:** The script `uniu.py` seems to be designed to identify unique IP addresses and count their access to a particular API endpoint, likely `/api/`. This is a common task in log analysis, security monitoring, or understanding API usage.
*   **Analysis Summary:**
    *   The script found 5 unique IP addresses.
    *   It lists each unique IP address, specifies the endpoint they accessed (`/api/`), and provides a count of their accesses to that endpoint.
    *   A final summary indicates the total number of calls to the `/api/` endpoint and the total number of unique IPs accessing it.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Output:**

```
PS E:\data science tool\main\grok> python uniu.py
Found 5 unique IP addresses:

------------------------------------
IP: 43.230.106.157
Accessed endpoints: /api/
API endpoint access count: 93

------------------------------------
IP: 52.234.41.123
Accessed endpoints: /api/

I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.

To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.

Please look into this

where did you check it?

Also, on <https://www.vercel-status.com/> this is showing  
**Update** - npm have released a status page incident, and users can monitor further updates here: [https://status.npmjs.org](https://status.npmjs.org/)

Today I got my TDS Project-2 Score and it is showing as absent although I submitted my TDS project 2 , also deployed the app successfully and also filled the g-form

Here‚Äôs my deployed application on-render link with the attached screenshot of my TDS Dashboard:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a progress or grade report page for an online data science course, providing a summary of a student's performance across various assessments.

**Key Information:**

*   **Course Title:** "Tools in Data Science"
*   **Course Status:** "NEW COURSE" (indicated in the header, suggesting it might be a recent addition or an ongoing course).

*   **Student Performance Breakdown:**

    *   **Weekly Assignments:**
        *   Week 1 Assignment: 92.50
        *   Week 2 Assignment: 90.00
        *   Week 3 Assignment: 0.00 (This is a critical point, indicating a complete failure or non-submission for this assignment)
        *   Week 4 Assignment: 100.00
        *   Week 5 Assignment: 100.00
        *   Week 6 Assignment: Absent (Another critical point, indicating non-submission, non-completion, or that the assignment has not yet been made available/graded)

    *   **Quizzes:**
        *   PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1: 90.00

    *   **Course Project:**
        *   COURSE PROJECT: 5.00 (This is an extremely low score for the first component of the project, suggesting a significant issue with its completion or quality)
        *   Course Project Score 2: Absent (The second component of the course project is missing or not yet graded)

*   **End Term Exam Eligibility:**
    *   The most crucial piece of information is the clear statement:
        *   "Allowed to take End Term Exam?"
        *   "Yes"
        This indicates that despite the zeros, absences, and the very low course project score, the student has met the necessary criteria to be eligible for the final examination. This might be due to a weighted grading system where other components carry more weight, or specific minimum requirements that were still met.

*   **Navigation:**
    *   A "Go to Course page >" button is visible at the bottom, suggesting a link to navigate back to the main course content.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
No code, commands, or error messages are present in this screenshot. The information displayed is purely a grade summary and eligibility status.*

Dear Sir,  
In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent <https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/> as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) sir ,  
I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.

If possible, I kindly request either of the following:

1. Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or
2. Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50‚Äì60 second activation time.

Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

Thank you for your support and guidance.

Hi sir [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

**Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers**  
**GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.  
**Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** ‚Äì all received correct results.  
**No issues seen in logs or deployment** ‚Äì everything was set up properly.  
**Others in my group got full marks** ‚Äì we worked on the same project.

**I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**  
**I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.  
**This is my last term** ‚Äì if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** [FastAPI - Swagger UI](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)
* **API Endpoint:** <http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api>

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

as you can see my vm is working fine here  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a session in the serial console of an Azure Virtual Machine, named `shashitdsproject2`, actively managing and troubleshooting a Python-based FastAPI application using Uvicorn as a systemd service.

### Key Information

1.  **Environment:** Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine, specifically the `shashitdsproject2` VM.
2.  **Access Method:** The user is interacting with the VM via its "Serial console," which provides direct low-level access to the VM's terminal output, useful for debugging boot issues or when network connectivity is lost.
3.  **User & Directory:** The user is `shashi`, currently in the `~/GASolver` directory on the VM.
4.  **Application Type:** The console output indicates a Python application using `uvicorn` (a fast ASGI server) to run a `FastAPI Server`. The code snippet at the top also shows a FastAPI-like `async def process_request` function handling `Form` data and `UploadFile`.
5.  **Service Management:** The primary activity is managing the `uvicorn.service` using `systemctl`, a command-line utility for controlling the systemd system and service manager.
6.  **Initial Problem:** The user initially encountered a `sudo: command not found` error, suggesting a PATH issue or that `sudo` was not correctly set up for the user at that moment. However, subsequent commands show `sudo` working, implying this was resolved or was a transient issue.
7.  **Current Status:** The `uvicorn.service` is successfully running (`Active: active (running)`), started recently (33 seconds ago from the screenshot's capture time). It's also `enabled`, meaning it's configured to start automatically on boot.
8.  **Warnings/Notes:** The Uvicorn server logs show two warnings:
    *   "Using slow pure-python code..." - Suggests potential performance bottlenecks if certain libraries (like `orjson`, `ujson`, `msgpack`) are not installed for faster JSON handling.
    *   "Couldn't find ffmpeg or ffprobe..." - Indicates that certain multimedia processing functionalities might be disabled due to missing dependencies. These are warnings, not errors, and the server is confirmed to be running.

### Transcribed Code

The code snippet at the top of the console window appears to be a Python function, likely an endpoint definition for a FastAPI application:

```python
async def process_request(
    question: str = Form(...),
    File: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)
):
    try:
        #data = question
        #print(data)
```

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user interacting with an API documentation page, likely generated by FastAPI or Swagger UI, for a data science project deployed on Microsoft Azure. The context suggests it's from a data science course, possibly an assignment involving a web service.

The user is testing a `POST` endpoint to `process_request_api_post`. The interface displays the `curl` command equivalent to the request, the actual request URL, and the server's response including the status code, response body, and headers.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application Type:** The presence of "FastAPI" in one of the browser tabs and the `docs` path in the URL strongly suggest the API is built using the FastAPI framework.
2.  **Deployment Environment:** The URL `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com` indicates the application is deployed on Azure Cloud Apps. Other tabs like "Azure VM" reinforce an Azure-based infrastructure.
3.  **API Endpoint:** The specific endpoint being tested is `/api` which processes a `POST` request. The full path in the URL `docs#/default/process_request_api_post` indicates this is documentation for a method named `process_request_api_post`.
4.  **Request Details:**
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **Request Body/Parameters:** The request sends two pieces of data as `multipart/form-data`:
        *   A `question`: "What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under /malyalammp3/ from 15:00 until before 22:00 on Saturdays?" This suggests the API is designed to query or analyze log data, likely for web traffic.
        *   A `file`: `@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz` with `type=application/x-gzip`. This implies the API processes a compressed file, which likely contains the log data needed to answer the question.
5.  **Server Response:**
    *   **Status Code:** `200 OK`, indicating the request was successful.
    *   **Response Body:** The API returned a JSON object containing an "answer".
    *   **Answer:** `5082`. This is the calculated number of successful GET requests based on the query.
    *   **Response Headers:**
        *   `content-type: application/json`: The response body is JSON.
        *   `server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)`: Indicates that an Nginx web server running on Ubuntu is acting as a reverse proxy in front of the FastAPI application.
        *   `date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:39:00 GMT`: A future date, which might be a placeholder, a system clock error, or intentional for testing purposes.
        *   `access-control-allow-origin: *`: Indicates the API is configured for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) from any origin.

**Transcriptions:**

**Curl Command:**
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'question=What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under /malyalammp3/ from 15:00 until before 22:00 on Saturdays?' \
  -F 'file=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz;type=application/x-gzip'
```

**Request URL:**
```
https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api
```

**Server response - Code:**
```

POST request through postman vscode  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a Postman interface showing the results of an API request. The user is attempting to interact with an API, and the response is an HTML page designed to render API documentation using Swagger UI.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Postman Application Context:**
*   The application in use is **Postman**, a popular tool for API development, testing, and documentation.
*   The current workspace is "My Workspace".

**2. API Request Details:**
*   **Method:** A **POST** request was made.
*   **Target URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api`
    *   This indicates the request was made to a local server running on port 8000 at the `/api` endpoint.
*   **Previous/Suggested URL:** `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`
    *   This URL, visible but grayed out in the URL bar, suggests a previous or alternative endpoint on an Azure cloud service, specifically related to documentation (`/docs`). This strongly hints at the user's intent to access API documentation.
*   **Query Params:** The "Query Params" tab is selected, but the table is empty, meaning no query parameters were included in this specific POST request.
*   **Headers/Body:** The "Headers (9)" and "Body" tabs for the request have green dots, indicating that there might be configured headers and/or a request body, but their content is not visible in this screenshot.

**3. API Response Details:**
*   **Status:** `200 OK`
    *   The request was successful.
*   **Time:** `286 ms`
    *   The response time was fast.
*   **Size:** `1.11 KB`
    *   The response body is relatively small, consistent with a small HTML file.
*   **Response Type:** The "Body" tab of the response is selected, and the content type is specified as `HTML`.
*   **Response Content (HTML & JavaScript - Swagger UI):**
    The response body is an HTML document containing JavaScript that initializes Swagger UI for API documentation.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (from Response Body):**

16 const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
17 url: '/openapi.json',
18 "dom_id": "#swagger-ui",
19 "layout": "BaseLayout",
```

**Interpretation of the Response Content:**
*   The HTML includes a `div` element with `id="swagger-ui"`, which is the standard placeholder for rendering the Swagger UI.
*   It then loads the `swagger-ui-bundle.js` script from a CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`). This JavaScript library is responsible for parsing OpenAPI/Swagger specifications and rendering the interactive documentation.
*   Finally, a script block initializes the `SwaggerUIBundle` object:
    *   `url: '/openapi.json'` specifies that the API definition (the OpenAPI/Swagger specification) should be fetched from the `/openapi.json` endpoint relative to the current URL.
    *   `"dom_id": "#swagger-ui"` tells Swagger UI to render itself within the `div` element with the ID `swagger-ui`.
    *   `"layout": "BaseLayout"` configures the layout of the Swagger UI.

**Conclusion:**
The user made a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api`. Despite it being a POST request, the API endpoint responded with an HTML page that sets up and loads the Swagger UI. This suggests that the `/api` endpoint itself might be serving the API documentation page, or there might be a misconfiguration or an intentional design where the base API endpoint redirects or serves the documentation when accessed directly, possibly to guide users. The ultimate goal seems to be to view the API's OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, which the local server successfully provided.*



GET request through postman vscode  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows a Postman client being used to make an HTTP request to a local API endpoint.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Request Details:**
*   **Application:** Postman
*   **HTTP Method:** `GET`
*   **Request URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api`
*   **Alternate/Associated URL:** `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs` (displayed below the active URL, possibly indicating a related cloud deployment or documentation path).
*   **Query Parameters:** None currently specified (Key/Value fields are empty).
*   **Environment:** "No Environment" is selected.

**2. Response Details:**
*   **Status:** `200 OK` (indicating a successful response).
*   **Time:** `247 ms`
*   **Size:** `1.11 KB`
*   **Response Body Type:** `HTML` (selected).
*   **Response Body Content (Transcribed Code):**

```html
<body>
    <div id="swagger-ui">
    </div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js"></script>
    <!-- `SwaggerUIBundle` is now available on the page -->
    <script>
        const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
            url: '/openapi.json',
            dom_id: '#swagger-ui',
            'layout': 'BaseLayout',
```

**3. Interpretation for a Data Science Course Forum:**
*   **Purpose:** The user is likely attempting to access an API, possibly one they are developing or learning about in a data science context.
*   **Outcome:** The `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/api` was successful.
*   **Response Content:** Instead of receiving raw data (e.g., JSON), the server responded with an HTML page designed to render **Swagger UI (OpenAPI documentation)**.
    *   This is indicated by the presence of `<div id="swagger-ui">`, the inclusion of `swagger-ui-bundle.js` from a CDN, and the JavaScript code initializing `SwaggerUIBundle` to load an API definition from `/openapi.json`.
*   **Potential Forum Discussion Points:**
    *   Why is the `/api` endpoint serving documentation instead of data? (Common for root API paths to redirect to docs).
    *   How to access the actual API endpoints if this path serves the documentation.
    *   Confirming that the Swagger UI is loading correctly (which it appears to be, given the 200 OK and the HTML structure).
    *   Troubleshooting local development setup for API documentation.
    *   Understanding the `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs` URL in relation to the local `localhost` setup.*



my server running on my friends on my friends laptop  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive API documentation interface, likely Swagger UI or a similar tool, for an application hosted on Azure. It shows details of an API request and its corresponding server response.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Endpoint & Operation:**
The API being documented and tested is `process_request_api_post` under the `/default` group. The base URL for the API appears to be `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`.

**2. Example `curl` Command (Request Details):**
A `curl` command example is provided, demonstrating how to interact with this API endpoint:
```
curl -X POST \
  https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'question=What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/'
```
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`
*   **Headers:**
    *   `accept: application/json` (Client expects JSON response)
    *   `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` (Indicates the request body is form data)
*   **Form Data Field:** `question` with the value `What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`

**3. Request URL (Executed):**
The specific URL targeted by the executed request is:
`https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`

**4. Server Response:**

*   **HTTP Status Code:**
    `200` (OK - indicating the request was successful).

*   **Response Body:**
    The server returned a JSON object containing an "answer":
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "https://shashikumarhohir.github.io/my-portfolio/"
    }
    ```
    This suggests the API processed the "question" and provided a specific GitHub Pages URL as an answer, likely a portfolio link.

*   **Response Headers:**
    ```
    access-control-allow-credentials: true
    access-control-allow-origin: https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com
    connection: keep-alive
    content-length: 61
    content-type: application/json
    date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:39:00 GMT
    server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
    vary: Origin
    ```
    *   **CORS Headers:** `access-control-allow-credentials` and `access-control-allow-origin` indicate that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled, specifically allowing requests from the same origin as the API.
    *   **Content Type:** `application/json` confirms the response body is JSON.
    *   **Server:** The API is served by `nginx/1.24.0` running on `Ubuntu`.
    *   **Date:** The date `Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:39:00 GMT` is notable as it is in the future, which could be an anomaly (e.g., system clock misconfiguration or a placeholder in a demo environment).

**In summary:** The screenshot demonstrates a successful API call to an Azure-hosted application. The API accepts a question as form data and responds with a JSON object containing an answer, specifically a GitHub Pages portfolio URL. This functionality suggests a Q&A or information retrieval system, possibly a component of a data science project or an intelligent agent.*

MY Project 2 status is currently marked as Absent in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I submitted the repository and API endpoints well before the deadline through the designated forum.

Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here:  
[API Form Submission](https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/)

I kindly request you to review my submission  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web application interface, likely part of a data science course or project management system, designed for submitting inquiries or assignments.

**Key Information:**

*   **Application Type:** A web-based form for submitting information.
*   **Hosting/Deployment:** The URL `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/` indicates the application is hosted on **Vercel**, a popular platform for deploying front-end web applications and serverless functions. The `tdsproject2` part suggests it's the second project in a series, reinforcing the "data science course" context. The `/api/` path might imply this is an API endpoint or a front-end that directly interacts with an API at this path.
*   **Core Functionality:** The main purpose of the page is to allow users to "Submit Your Question".
*   **Input Fields:**
    *   A text area for a `Question:` (multi-line input is supported, indicated by the resize grip in the bottom right corner of the text area).
    *   An optional file upload field for `Upload ZIP File (optional):`. This is crucial for a data science context, as it allows users to submit code, datasets, or project files (often bundled in ZIPs) along with their questions.
*   **Action Button:** A `Submit` button is provided to finalize the submission.
*   **User Interface:** The design is clean, minimalist, and user-friendly, with the form centered on a plain white background. The browser appears to be Brave.

**Transcriptions (Code, Commands, or Error Messages):**

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (<http://35.192.157.22.80>) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding /api/ and it was <http://35.192.157.22/api/>. My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.

Sir I have also recieved 0 marks, but I checked now also using python requests library and my server is working fine . But I see a lot of GET requets instead of POST in my logs file which was for the past couple of days requests, which is very unlikely . Please check my link again , its still active . App link - <http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2>

My test file-  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user interacting with a Python script (`burima.py`) designed to make an API request, likely to a backend that converts natural language questions into SQL queries.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Python Script (`burima.py`):**
    *   It imports the `requests` library for making HTTP calls.
    *   It defines a `url` for a FastAPI server endpoint: `http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2`.
    *   It constructs a `data` payload containing a "question" in natural language: `"What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to c "`. The question is truncated in the screenshot but clearly asks for a SQL query.
    *   It prepares `files` for upload (specifically a CSV file named `q-fastapi.csv` from the user's Downloads folder), but the line `files=files` within the `requests.post` call is commented out, meaning the file is *not* actually sent in this particular request.
    *   It sends a POST request to the defined URL with the `data` payload.

2.  **Terminal Output:**
    *   The user executes the Python script using `python burima.py` in a Powershell terminal within the `C:\Users\suneh\lab5` directory.
    *   The script successfully receives a response from the server, indicated by `Status Code: 200`.
    *   The server's response is a JSON object. The `answer` field of this JSON contains a SQL query: `"SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';"`. This SQL query precisely answers the natural language question posed in the `data` payload.

**In summary:** The user is demonstrating a system where a Python script sends a natural language query to a backend service (likely a "text-to-SQL" model via FastAPI), which then returns the corresponding SQL query. The file upload functionality, while present in the code, is currently disabled.

---

**Code, Commands, and Error Messages Transcription:**

**Python Code (from `burima.py`):**
```python
import requests

# Replace with your actual FastAPI server URL
url = "http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2"

# Define form data
data = {
    "question": r"""What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to c """
}
files={"file": ("q-fastapi.csv", open("C:/Users/suneh/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv", "rb"), "text/plain")}
# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, data=data) #files=files
```

**Terminal Commands and Output:**
```
PS C:\Users\suneh\lab5> python burima.py
Status Code: 200
Response JSON: {"answer": "SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';"}
PS C:\Users\suneh\lab5>
```*



My server log file -  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log output, likely from a web server or network monitoring tool, showing a sequence of HTTP requests and server responses, interspersed with warnings about invalid requests. This type of log data is commonly analyzed in data science for purposes such as security monitoring, traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and understanding network behavior.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Log Source:** The output is a series of entries, each prefixed with either `INFO:` or `WARNING:`.
2.  **HTTP Request Logs (`INFO` lines):**
    *   Each `INFO` line represents an attempted HTTP request to a server.
    *   **Format:** `INFO: [Source IP Address]:[Source Port] - "[HTTP Method] [Requested Path] [HTTP Protocol Version]" [HTTP Status Code] [Status Message]`
    *   **Source IP & Port:** Various IP addresses and associated ephemeral ports are making requests (e.g., `103.158.43.17:7624`, `3.138.153.199:41458`, `167.94.138.61:60428`).
    *   **HTTP Methods:**
        *   `POST`: Used for sending data to the server (seen once for `/tdsp2`).
        *   `GET`: Used for requesting data from the server (predominant).
        *   `PRI`: A less common method, potentially related to HTTP/2 connection prefaces or malformed requests (seen once as `PRI %2A HTTP/2.0`).
    *   **Requested Paths:** Common paths include the root (`/`), `/tdsp2`, and `/favicon.ico`. One request shows `%2A`, which is the URL-encoded form of an asterisk (`*`).
    *   **HTTP Protocol Versions:** Requests are observed using `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, and `HTTP/2.0`.
    *   **HTTP Status Codes & Messages:**
        *   `200 OK`: Indicates a successful request (seen once for `/tdsp2`).
        *   `404 Not Found`: Indicates the requested resource could not be found on the server (most common response).
3.  **Error/Warning Messages (`WARNING` lines):**
    *   A recurring warning: `Invalid HTTP request received.` This indicates that the server received data that it could not parse as a valid HTTP request, suggesting malformed requests or potentially attempted exploits/scans.
4.  **Overall Trend:** The logs show a significant number of failed requests (404 Not Found) and malformed requests (`Invalid HTTP request received`), with only one successful (200 OK) request visible. This could suggest:
    *   Clients attempting to access non-existent resources.
    *   Automated scans or probes by bots or malicious actors looking for vulnerabilities or common paths.
    *   Misconfigured clients or network issues.

My app request handeling -  


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays Python code defining an asynchronous API endpoint, most likely using a framework like FastAPI due to the `app.post` decorator and the use of `Form(...)` and `File(None)` for parameter parsing.

**Key Information:**

1.  **API Endpoint Definition:** The code defines an HTTP POST endpoint for a web application.
2.  **Endpoint Path:** The specific URL path for this endpoint is `/tdsp2`.
3.  **Asynchronous Function:** The `async def` keyword indicates that the function `tdsp2` is asynchronous, allowing it to handle requests concurrently without blocking the main thread, which is beneficial for performance in web applications (especially those involving I/O like file uploads or external API calls).
4.  **Input Parameters (Request Body):**
    *   **`question`**: A required string parameter that is expected to be part of the request's form data (`Form(...)`). This suggests users will submit a text question.
    *   **`file`**: An optional file upload parameter (`Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`). This means users can optionally upload a file along with their question. If no file is provided, the `file` variable will be `None`.
5.  **Relevance to Data Science:** This structure is very common for deploying machine learning models or data processing pipelines as web APIs. For example, a user might submit a `question` (e.g., a query for an NLP model) and/or a `file` (e.g., an image for a computer vision model, or a CSV file for data analysis).

**Code Transcription:**

```python
@app.post("/tdsp2")
async def tdsp2(question: str = Form(...), file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None) ):
```*

I noticed that my Project 2 status is currently marked as ‚ÄúAbsent‚Äù in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I \*\*submitted the GitHub repository and Vercel API link well before the deadline  
via the designated forum.

Additionally, my **Vercel server is still active**, and the API is functioning correctly, which can be verified here:  
[API Form Submission](https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/)

I also have a **response copy from the forum confirming my submission**, including both the GitHub and Vercel links, as proof. I kindly request you to review this and take the necessary steps to update my project status.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a Google Form, likely used for project submission in a data science course.

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The form is collecting links to project deliverables for "Project 2". The user is currently on page "5 of 118" of the form, suggesting a very comprehensive submission process.
*   **GitHub Repository Submission:**
    *   The form asks for the link to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2". This is a required field (indicated by the asterisk).
    *   An example format is provided to guide the student.
    *   The student has submitted a valid GitHub repository link.
*   **API Endpoint Submission:**
    *   The form also requests the link to the student's API endpoint, which is another required field.
    *   It includes an important instruction: "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL", indicating that the API will be tested for its ability to handle POST requests, common for data submission or model inference.
    *   The student has submitted a Vercel-hosted API endpoint.
*   **Form Functionality:** Standard Google Forms footer options are visible, including "Create your own Google Form" and a "Report" option for suspicious forms.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (URLs are transcribed as they appear):**

*   **Question for GitHub Repository:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *"
*   **GitHub Example URL:** `https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web-based form, likely a component of a data science course's support system or a project submission portal, given the context of a "data science course forum."

### Key Information:

1.  **Application Type:** It's a web application, presented in a Brave browser window.
2.  **Purpose:** The primary purpose of the page is to allow a user to "Submit Your Question." This suggests a mechanism for students or participants to ask questions, perhaps to instructors, TAs, or a forum.
3.  **Deployment Environment:** The URL `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/` indicates that the application is deployed on Vercel, a popular platform for front-end applications and serverless functions. The `/api/` path suggests that this form might be an interface to a backend API that processes these submissions. "tdsproject2" implies it's related to "The Data Science Project 2."
4.  **Form Fields:**
    *   **Question Input:** A large text area labeled "Question:" is provided for users to type in their inquiry. The small grab handle in the bottom-right corner indicates it's a resizable textarea.
    *   **File Upload (Optional):** There's an input field for "Upload ZIP File (optional):" This is highly relevant for a data science context, as it allows users to attach supplementary materials like code, datasets, notebooks, or project files that might be necessary for debugging or understanding their question. The "No file chosen" text indicates no file has been selected yet.
    *   **Submission Button:** A prominent blue "Submit" button finalizes the form submission.
5.  **User Interface:** The interface is clean, minimalistic, and centrally aligned, focusing solely on the question submission task.
6.  **No Error/Success Messages:** The screenshot does not show any pre-existing error messages or a confirmation of a successful submission. There is a blank area below the submit button that could potentially display such messages upon form interaction.
7.  **Browser Features:** The top bar shows standard browser navigation (back, forward, refresh), a bookmark icon, a share icon, the Brave browser's shields icon (for privacy protection), a star icon (likely for favorites), a padlock icon (for site security info), and a hamburger menu icon (for browser settings).

### Transcribed Text (UI Labels & URL):

*   **URL:** `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Header:** `Submit Your Question`
*   **Label:** `Question:`
*   **Label:** `Upload ZIP File (optional):`
*   **Button Text:** `Choose File`

Dear Sir, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
I need your immediate attention regarding my **project-2 , as I received zero marks,** but **my server is running completely fine**. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers

GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.

Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people ‚Äì all received correct results.

No issues seen in logs or deployment ‚Äì everything was set up properly.

Others in my group got full marks ‚Äì we worked on the same project.

I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.

I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.  
Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:  
**API Documentation: [FastAPI - Swagger UI](https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)**

**I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.  
I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.  
Please don‚Äôt ignore this.  
Thanks,

Here im attaching All the proofs of my server which is running  
above is my server running perfectly fine  
below is the execution and getting right answers screenshots  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a successful interaction with an API endpoint, likely part of an intelligent agent or automation system developed as part of a data science course project.

Here's the key information:

**1. API Documentation Interface:**
*   The interface appears to be an interactive API documentation tool, such as Swagger UI or a similar platform. This allows users to test API endpoints directly from a web browser.
*   The URL `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs#/default/process_request_api_post` indicates an Azure-hosted application (`bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`) and specifically targets the documentation for a `POST` endpoint named `process_request_api_post`.
*   Buttons like "Execute" and "Clear" are standard for such interfaces, allowing the user to trigger the API call and reset the form.

**2. API Request Details (Curl Command):**
*   The system has generated a `curl` command representing the exact HTTP request made.
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint:** `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api` (Note: The `process_request_api_post` in the URL path is likely the documentation path, while the actual API endpoint is `/api`).
*   **Headers:**
    *   `Accept: application/json`: The client expects a JSON response.
    *   `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`: The request body is sent as form data, which is common for file uploads or sending structured data with a mixture of types.
*   **Payload/Form Data:** A form field named `question` is sent, containing a detailed prompt or task description. This is the crucial input to the system.

**3. API Response Details:**
*   **Request URL:** Confirms the endpoint: `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200` (OK). This signifies that the request was successfully processed by the server without any errors.
*   **Response Body:** A JSON object structured as follows:
    *   A top-level key: `"answer"`.
    *   The value of `"answer"` is another JSON object where keys are dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, and values are strings describing the weather for that specific date.
    *   The response provides a 14-day weather forecast, starting from April 15, 2025, to April 28, 2025.
    *   Examples of weather descriptions include "Sunny and light winds," "Thundery showers and a gentle breeze," and "Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze."

**4. Inference about the System's Functionality:**
*   Based on the `question` parameter's content ("Your Task As part of this initiative, you are tasked with developing a system that automates the following: API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather for ") and the weather forecast in the response, this API endpoint likely functions as an intelligent agent or a wrapper around a large language model (LLM) that can interpret natural language queries.
*   The system successfully understood the request to "fetch the weather" and, presumably, integrated with an external "BBC Weather API" to retrieve and format the 14-day forecast, demonstrating "API Integration and Data Retrieval" capability.
*   The truncation of the `question` implies that the full query might have included a location or specific dates, which the system then defaulted or inferred.

please dont ignore this  
i have got right solutions as you can see, so please consider for rechecking.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive API testing interface, likely part of a data science or programming course, allowing users to make requests to a specific endpoint.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Endpoint and Request Parameters:**

*   **API Function:** The interface is designed to accept a "question" (a string, required) and an optional "file" (binary data).
*   **Question Input:** The user has provided a question related to Google Sheets formulas. The partial input visible in the text box is "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. T".
*   **File Input:** No file has been chosen or sent.

**2. Executed Request Details (as a Curl Command):**

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`
*   **Headers:**
    *   `accept: application/json`
    *   `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` (indicating the `question` is sent as a form field)
*   **Question Parameter Value (from Curl command - fully visible):**
    The full question is an instruction and a Google Sheets formula:
    `Let''s make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won''t work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) What is th`
    *(Note: The `\'\'` are escaped single quotes, making the original text `Let's` and `won't`. The question cuts off at "What is th", likely "What is the result?")*

**3. Request URL:**

*   The direct URL to which the request was sent is confirmed as:
    `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`

**4. Server Response:**

*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200` (indicating a successful request).
*   **Response Body:** The server returned a JSON object containing an "answer":
    ```json
    {
      "answer": 585
    }
    ```

**Summary of Interaction:**

A user submitted a POST request to an Azure-hosted API (`bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`) with a question about a specific Google Sheets formula: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10))`. The API successfully processed this question and returned the numerical answer `585`. This suggests the API is capable of interpreting and computing results from Google Sheets formulas.*

My marks are also showing as zero.

My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc

Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again

EDIT: Update on previous post.

Attached image of requests made on my endpoint by I presume the TDS team at 4:53 PM on 10th April:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a terminal window displaying the output of an `ngrok` session, which is a common tool used in data science and web development for exposing local servers to the internet for testing or demonstration purposes. The image also shows part of a macOS desktop and keyboard.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. `ngrok` Session Status and Information:**
The top section of the terminal provides details about the active `ngrok` tunnel:
*   **Status:** `online` (indicating the `ngrok` tunnel is active and connected).
*   **User:** `Gaurav Ghodge (Plan: Free)` (identifies the user and their `ngrok` plan).
*   **Version:** `3.22.0` (the version of `ngrok` being used).
*   **Location:** `India (in)` (the geographic location of the `ngrok` server or the user).
*   **Latency:** `24ms` (the round-trip time or latency to the `ngrok` server).
*   **Local Tunnel Address:** `http://127.0.0.1:4040` (This is the local address and port on the user's machine that `ngrok` is forwarding traffic to).
*   **Public Tunnel Address:** `https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app ->` (This is the public HTTPS URL generated by `ngrok` that external users can access, which then tunnels requests to the local address. The `->` indicates it's forwarding to the local address).

**2. Performance Metrics:**
Below the tunnel information, there are performance statistics:
*   `ttl`: 7 (Time To Live, possibly related to connections)
*   `opn`: 0 (Open connections)
*   `rt1`: 0.01 (Response Time 1-second average, likely in seconds)
*   `rt5`: 0.01 (Response Time 5-second average, likely in seconds)
*   `p50`: 8.76 (50th percentile response time, likely in milliseconds)
*   `p90`: 10.3 (90th percentile response time, likely in milliseconds)

**3. Request Logs:**
The "Requests" section displays a log of HTTP requests received through the `ngrok` tunnel. Each entry includes a timestamp, HTTP method, requested path, and the HTTP response status code and message.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (Request Logs):**
```
Requests
------------
:53:08.409 IST POST /api                307 Temporary Redirect
:53:08.475 IST POST /api                200 OK
:53:07.786 IST POST /api                307 Temporary Redirect
:53:07.786 IST POST /api                307 Temporary Redirect
:53:07.786 IST POST /api                307 Temporary Redirect
:53:07.896 IST POST /api                200 OK
:53:07.886 IST POST /api                200 OK
:53:07.886 IST POST /api                307 Temporary Redirect
:53:07.886 IST POST /api                200 OK
:53:07.886 IST POST /api                200 OK
13:37:23.955 IST POST /api              200 OK
```
**Observations from Request Logs:**
*   Most requests are `POST` requests to the `/api` endpoint.
*   The timestamps (e.g., `:53:08.409 IST`) suggest `MM:SS.milliseconds` format with `IST` likely standing for Indian Standard Time. There's a notable jump in time for the last request (`13:37:23.955`), indicating a longer gap between that request and the preceding ones.
*   The responses are a mix of `200 OK` (successful requests) and `307 Temporary Redirect`. The presence of multiple `307 Temporary Redirect` responses might indicate that the API endpoint or the server it's interacting with is temporarily redirecting requests, which could be an intended behavior or a configuration issue.

**4. Visible Desktop Environment and Hardware:**
*   The screenshot is taken on a **MacBook** laptop, identifiable by the distinctive keyboard layout (e.g., F3 for brightness, F4 for search, F5 for microphone, F6 for Do Not Disturb/moon, F7/F8 for media controls) and the macOS dock at the bottom of the screen.
*   The desktop wallpaper features an orange, textured pattern.
*   Several application icons are visible on the **macOS dock**, including (from left to right): Messages, Finder, App Store, System Settings, VS Code, VLC, Spotify, Safari, Discord, Figma, qBittorrent, Calendar, Apple Maps, Telegram, and ChatGPT.

In summary, the screenshot provides a comprehensive view of an `ngrok` session, detailing its operational status, performance, and a log of recent API interactions, all within a macOS environment. The `307 Temporary Redirect` responses on the `/api` endpoint are a point of interest for debugging or understanding the application's behavior.*



Ran curl request multiple times LOCALLY on endpoint after score got published to check:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a Visual Studio Code environment for a Python-based project, likely an assignment from "IITM" (Indian Institute of Technology Madras), focusing on an API for question answering.

Here's a detailed analysis of the key information:

**1. Project Context & Structure:**
*   **Project Name:** `TDS-PROJECT-2.2` is the active project. There's also `TDS-project-2` which might be an older version or related.
*   **Directory Structure:**
    *   `app/`: Contains the core application logic.
        *   `utils/`: A sub-directory for utility functions.
            *   `file_handler.py`: Suggests functionality for handling file operations, likely uploads/downloads.
            *   `functions.py`: Likely contains core business logic or helper functions.
            *   `openai_client.py`: **Crucially indicates integration with OpenAI's API**, suggesting an LLM (Large Language Model) component for processing questions.
        *   `main.py`: The main entry point for the FastAPI application.
    *   `.env`: Common for storing environment variables, e.g., API keys.
    *   `answers.json`: Could be a data source for answers, a cache, or a testing artifact.
    *   `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`: Standard project files.
    *   `server.py`: Could be an alternative server setup or related to deployment.

**2. `main.py` (FastAPI Application Code):**
*   **Imports:**
    *   `FastAPI`, `File`, `UploadFile`, `Form`, `HTTPException` from `fastapi`: Essential for building RESTful APIs, specifically handling file uploads (`File`, `UploadFile`) and form data (`Form`).
    *   `CORSMiddleware` from `fastapi.middleware.cors`: Used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from different domains.
    *   `os`: Standard Python module, often used for environment variables or file paths.
    *   `Optional` from `typing`: Used for type hinting, indicating a parameter can be a specific type or `None`.
    *   `get_openai_response` from `app.utils.openai_client`: Confirms the use of OpenAI for generating responses.
    *   `save_upload_file_temporarily` from `app.utils.file_handler`: Confirms temporary file storage for uploaded files.
    *   `from app.utils.functions import *`: Imports all functions from `app.utils.functions`, implying these are general-purpose utilities or core logic for the assignment.
*   **FastAPI App Initialization:**
    *   `app = FastAPI(title="IITM Assignment API")`: The application is initialized with the title "IITM Assignment API", confirming its academic context.
*   **CORS Configuration:**
    *   The `CORSMiddleware` is configured to allow `*` (all) origins, methods, and headers, and `allow_credentials=True`. This is a very permissive setup, common for development environments to avoid CORS issues during testing.
*   **API Endpoint Definition (`/api/`):**
    *   `@app.post("/api/")`: Defines a POST endpoint at the `/api/` path.
    *   `async def process_question(...)`: An asynchronous function to handle the request.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `question: str = Form(...)`: A required string parameter named `question`, expected to be sent as form data. This is the core input for the question-answering functionality.
        *   `file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`: An optional file upload parameter. If a file is provided, it will be of type `UploadFile`; otherwise, it will be `None`. This suggests the API can process questions with or without accompanying documents/files.
    *   `try:`: The function body begins with a `try` block, indicating that error handling is implemented or planned for the logic within.

**3. Terminal Activity:**
*   **User and Directory:** `gauravghodge@Gauravs-MacBook-Air TDS-PROJECT-2.2 %` shows the user `gauravghodge` is on a MacBook Air, currently in the `TDS-PROJECT-2.2` directory, using `zsh` shell.
*   **Command Executed:** A `curl` command is used to test the API.
    *   `curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/" \`
        `  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \`
        `  -F "question=How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?"`
    *   This command makes a POST request to the local FastAPI server (`http://localhost:8000/api/`).
    *   It specifies `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`, which is necessary when sending `Form` and `File` data to FastAPI.
    *   It sends a form field named `question` with the value: "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?". This specific question implies the API might be capable of date/calendar calculations, either directly or via the LLM.
*   **API Response:**
    *   `{"answer":"1121"}`: The API successfully returned a JSON object containing an `answer` key with the value "1121" (as a string). This confirms the API's ability to process the given question and provide a numerical answer.

**Exact Transcriptions:**

**`main.py` Code:**

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a well-structured Python project within VS Code, focusing on an API developed using FastAPI, likely designed for natural language processing or question-answering, possibly integrating with OpenAI.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Development Environment:**
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
*   **Project Name:** `TDS-PROJECT-2.2` (visible in the top bar and file explorer).
*   **Programming Language:** Python (indicated by `.py` file extensions and the Python logo/version in the status bar).
*   **Python Version:** 3.13.2 (from the bottom status bar).
*   **Shell:** Zsh (`zsh` is visible in the terminal title and prompt).

**2. File Explorer (Left Pane):**
*   The project has a modular structure, including:
    *   `app/`: Contains the main application logic.
        *   `utils/`: Subdirectory for utility functions, including:
            *   `file_handler.py`: Likely handles file uploads and temporary storage.
            *   `functions.py`: General utility functions.
            *   `openai_client.py`: Implies integration with OpenAI's API.
        *   `main.py`: The primary FastAPI application file, currently open.
    *   `TDS-project-2`: Appears to be another project directory, possibly an older version or related component.
    *   `tests/`: For testing the application.
    *   `.env`: Environment variables configuration file.
    *   `answers.json`: A data file, possibly containing predefined answers or a knowledge base.
    *   `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`: Standard project files for licensing, documentation, and dependencies.
    *   `server.py`: Could be an alternative server setup or a script to run the FastAPI app.

**3. Code Editor (Main Pane - `app/main.py`):**
The `main.py` file is open, showing the initial import statements for a FastAPI application:

```python
1 from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, Form, HTTPException
2 from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
3 import os
4 from typing import Optional
5 from app.utils.openai_client import get_openai_response
6 from app.utils.file_handler import save_upload_file_temporarily
7
```
*   **FastAPI Imports:** `FastAPI` itself, along with components like `File`, `UploadFile`, `Form`, and `HTTPException`, indicating capabilities for handling file uploads, form data, and custom HTTP error responses.
*   **CORS Middleware:** `CORSMiddleware` is imported, suggesting that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled for the API, allowing requests from different domains.
*   **OS Module:** `os` for operating system interactions (e.g., file paths, environment variables).
*   **Typing:** `Optional` from `typing` is used for type hinting.
*   **Custom Utilities:** Imports `get_openai_response` from `app.utils.openai_client` and `save_upload_file_temporarily` from `app.utils.file_handler`, confirming the project's dependency on OpenAI and its ability to manage uploaded files.

**4. Terminal Window (Overlaying Code Editor):**
A `zsh` terminal window is open, showing command execution and output.

*   **ngrok Session (Title Bar):** The title bar of the smaller terminal window shows "gauravghodge ‚Äî ngrok http 8000 ‚Äî 80x24". This indicates that `ngrok` is running, exposing a local service on port `8000` to the internet. This is a common setup for testing webhooks or sharing local development APIs.
*   **User and Host:** `gauravghodge@Gauravs-MacBook-Air`
*   **Last Login Info:** `Last login: Tue Apr 15 19:01:31 on ttys013` (Standard shell output).

*   **Executed Command (cURL Request):**
    ```bash
    gauravghodge@Gauravs-MacBook-Air ~ % curl -X POST "https://4fd9-150-107-43-113.ngrok-free.app/api/" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F question="How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?"
    ```
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **URL:** `https://4fd9-150-107-43-113.ngrok-free.app/api/` (This is the publicly exposed ngrok URL for the API endpoint).
    *   **Header:** `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"` specifies the request body format, consistent with FastAPI's `Form` and `UploadFile` handling.
    *   **Form Data:** `-F question="How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?"` sends a form field named `question` with a specific natural language query.

*   **API Response (JSON):**
    ```json
    {"answer":"1121"}
    ```
    *   The API successfully processed the `question` and returned a JSON object containing an `answer` field with the value "1121".

**5. Overall Context and Inferences:**
The screenshot demonstrates a developer testing a FastAPI application that acts as a question-answering API.
*   The application takes natural language questions (specifically, a date-related query about the number of Wednesdays) via a `POST` request.
*   It likely uses the imported `openai_client` to process the question (e.g., via a large language model) and/or `functions.py` to perform the date calculation.
*   The API then returns the calculated answer in a structured JSON format.
*   The use of `ngrok` suggests that the developer is either sharing the local API for external testing/demonstration or testing a webhook integration.
*   The absence of error messages indicates a successful API call and response.*

Hi sir [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

**Server is running and reachable.**  
**GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.  
**Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** ‚Äì all received correct results.  
**No issues seen in logs or deployment** ‚Äì everything was set up properly.  
**Others in my group got full marks** ‚Äì we worked on the same project.

**I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**  
**I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.  
**This is my last term** ‚Äì if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** [FastAPI - Swagger UI](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)
* **API Endpoint:** <http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api>

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

as you can see my vm is working fine here  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, including exact transcriptions:

### Key Information

The screenshot displays the **Serial Console** of a **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine** named `shashitdsproject2`. The user, `shashi`, is interacting with the VM's command line. The primary goal appears to be managing a **Uvicorn FastAPI server** application.

**1. Azure Portal Context:**
*   The user is in the Microsoft Azure portal, specifically on the page for `shashitdsproject2` VM's "Serial console".
*   The left navigation pane confirms "Serial console" is selected.

**2. Python Code Snippet (Visible at the top of the console):**
*   A fragment of an `async` Python function named `process_request` is visible. This strongly suggests a web API endpoint, likely using a framework like FastAPI (given the Uvicorn context).
*   The function is designed to accept form data (`question: str = Form(...)`) and an optional file upload (`File: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`).
*   Two lines within the `try` block are commented out (`#data = question` and `#print(data)`), indicating the core logic for processing the input might be temporarily disabled or under development/debugging.

**3. Command Line Interaction and Service Management:**
*   **Initial `sudo` Issue:** The user first attempted to restart `nginx` using `sudo`, but encountered a `sudo: command not found` error. This implies that the `sudo` package might not be installed or the `shashi` user is not configured to use `sudo` on this VM.
*   **Uvicorn Service Management:** The main activity is focused on managing a `uvicorn.service`.
    *   The user executed a chained command to `daemon-reload`, `start`, `enable`, and `status` the `uvicorn.service`.
    *   The `uvicorn.service` is confirmed to be **`active (running)`**.
    *   It started on "Mon 2025-04-14 09:35:04 UTC" and had been running for 33 seconds at the time of the screenshot.
    *   The service's main process is Python (PID: 1782) and is consuming 318.1MB of memory (peak 320.1MB) and 4.123s of CPU time.
    *   The command being executed by the service is `/home/shashi/GASolver/.envpr2/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app`, indicating a Python FastAPI application (`main:app`) is being served by Uvicorn within a virtual environment (`.envpr2`) located in the `GASolver` directory.

**4. Uvicorn Service Logs and Warnings:**
*   The `systemctl status uvicorn` command output includes logs from the Uvicorn service:
    *   A warning about "Using slow pure-Python arcode implementation." This suggests a potential performance bottleneck related to a specific dependency or configuration.
    *   A warning "Couldn't find ffmpeg or ffprobe in PATH!" This indicates that the application or one of its dependencies expects these multimedia tools to be available, but they are not found. This might affect functionality related to video/audio processing.
    *   Standard Uvicorn startup messages: "Started server process", "Waiting for application startup.", and "Application startup complete."
    *   The final visible log line, "Uvicorn running on ht", is truncated but likely refers to the HTTP address where Uvicorn is serving the application.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an interactive API documentation page, likely generated by FastAPI's Swagger UI, for a data science project deployed on Microsoft Azure. The user is testing a `POST` API endpoint.

---

### Key Information

1.  **Context:** The user is interacting with an API for a data science project named `shashitdsproject2` hosted on `cloudapp.azure.com` in the `centralindia` region. The browser tabs indicate this is part of a course, likely "TDS 2025", and the underlying API framework is FastAPI.
2.  **API Endpoint:** The specific endpoint being tested is `/api`, which is configured to accept `POST` requests. The current page shows the documentation for `process_request_api_post`.
3.  **Request Details:**
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **Content Type:** `multipart/form-data`, indicating that the request includes form fields and potentially files.
    *   **Inputs:**
        *   A `question` parameter: A natural language query related to data analysis.
        *   A `file` parameter: A gzipped file (`s-anand.net-May-2024.gz`) of type `application/x-gzip`.
    *   **Specific Query:** The question posed is "What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under /malayalammp3/ from 15:00 until before 22:00 on Saturdays?". This suggests the API performs log analysis or similar data querying on the provided gzipped file.
4.  **Response Details:**
    *   **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK`, indicating the request was successful.
    *   **Response Body:** A JSON object `{"answer": 5082}`. This is the numerical result of the question asked, suggesting that there were 5082 successful GET requests matching the criteria.
    *   **Response Headers:**
        *   `access-control-allow-origin: *`: CORS is enabled, allowing requests from any origin.
        *   `content-type: application/json`: The response is in JSON format.
        *   `server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)`: The server handling the request is Nginx running on an Ubuntu system, likely acting as a reverse proxy for the FastAPI application.
        *   `date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:39:00 GMT`: This date is notable as it is in the future from the likely current date (assuming the screenshot was taken in 2024), which could be a timestamp discrepancy or a pre-configured demo.

POST request through postman vscode  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows a user interacting with an API using **Postman**, an API development environment. The user is attempting to access documentation for a data science project hosted on Azure.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Application Context:**
*   **Tool:** Postman.
*   **Purpose:** The user is sending an HTTP request to an API endpoint.

**2. Request Details:**
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Request URL:** `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`
    *   This indicates the API is likely deployed on Microsoft Azure (`.cloudapp.azure.com`).
    *   The path `/docs` strongly suggests an endpoint for API documentation.
*   **Query Parameters:** None are being sent (the "Query Params" section is active but empty).
*   **Headers:** The "Headers (9)" tab is highlighted, meaning 9 headers are included in the request, though their content is not visible.
*   **Body:** The "Body" tab has a green dot, indicating a body might be part of the request, but it's not the active tab for display.

**3. Response Details:**
*   **Status:** `200 OK`
    *   This is a successful response, meaning the server processed the request without error and returned the requested content.
*   **Time:** `286 ms` (response time)
*   **Size:** `1.11 KB` (response body size)
*   **Content Type:** The response body is interpreted as `HTML`.
*   **Response Body Content:** The displayed content is an HTML snippet that appears to be for **Swagger UI**.

**4. Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

**Request URL:**
`shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`

**HTTP Method:**
`POST`

**Response Status, Time, Size:**
`Status: 200 OK`
`Time: 286 ms`
`Size: 1.11 KB`

**Response Body (HTML/JavaScript):**
```html
<body>
    <div id="swagger-ui"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js"></script>
    <!-- `SwaggerUIBundle` is now available on the page -->
    <script>
    const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
        url: '/openapi.json',
        "dom_id": "#swagger-ui",
        "layout": "BaseLayout",
    });
    </script>
</body>
```

**Key Implications:**
*   Despite using a `POST` method (which is unusual for simply *fetching* documentation, where `GET` is typical), the server successfully returned the HTML for the Swagger UI. This suggests the server might be configured to serve the docs irrespective of the HTTP method for this specific `/docs` endpoint, or it's acting as a catch-all.
*   The HTML response contains JavaScript that loads `swagger-ui-bundle.js` from a CDN and then initializes `SwaggerUIBundle`.
*   Crucially, the `url: '/openapi.json'` line within the Swagger UI initialization indicates that the interactive API documentation (the OpenAPI/Swagger specification) will be fetched by the browser (or Postman's preview) from the `/openapi.json` endpoint relative to the base URL. This is a common pattern for exposing API documentation.
*   The user's next logical step would be to view this HTML in a web browser to interact with the Swagger UI and explore the API endpoints defined in `/openapi.json`.*



GET request through postman vscode  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from **Postman**, an API development environment, showing the result of a `GET` request.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Postman Application Details:**
*   The application is Postman, indicated by the logo and "POSTMAN" text in the top-left corner.
*   The interface is set to a dark theme.
*   The current workspace is "My Workspace".

**2. API Request Details:**
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api`
*   **Secondary URL/Context:** Next to the main request URL, `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs` is visible. This suggests a related cloud-deployed environment or a common documentation endpoint, possibly for the same API being developed locally.
*   **Request Configuration Tabs:** `Params`, `Authorization`, `Headers (9)`, `Body`, `Pre-request Script`, `Tests`, `Settings` are visible. The `Headers (9)` tab is highlighted, but the content pane immediately below shows "Query Params" which is currently empty (two blank Key/Value rows).

**3. API Response Details:**
*   **Status:** `200 OK` (Successful request).
*   **Time:** `247 ms`
*   **Size:** `1.11 KB`
*   **Response Body Type:** HTML (`HTML` tab selected in the response body viewer).
*   **Response Body Content (HTML/JavaScript):**
    The response body contains HTML code primarily designed to render Swagger UI for API documentation.

    **Transcribed Code:**
    ```html
    10 <body>
    11   <div id="swagger-ui">
    12   </div>
    13   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js"></script>
    14   <!-- `SwaggerUIBundle` is now available on the page -->
    15   <script>
    16     const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
    17       url: '/openapi.json',
    18       "dom_id": "#swagger-ui",
    19       "layout": "BaseLayout",
    ```

**4. Interpretation and Context for a Data Science Course Forum:**

*   **API Documentation Endpoint:** The response body indicates that the `http://localhost:8000/api` endpoint is configured to serve the HTML and JavaScript for **Swagger UI**. Swagger UI is a popular tool for visualizing and interacting with OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications.
*   **Local Development Setup:** The user is hitting a `localhost:8000` address, implying they are running a local development server for an API.
*   **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration:** The JavaScript code within the HTML response (`SwaggerUIBundle(...)`) tries to load the API definition from a relative path: `url: '/openapi.json'`. This means the Swagger UI will attempt to fetch the actual API specification from `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` to display the API endpoints and their details.
*   **Potential User Goal:** The user is likely attempting to view the documentation for their locally running API. The `200 OK` status for the HTML response means the Swagger UI page itself was successfully served. The next step for the user would typically be to ensure that the `/openapi.json` endpoint also serves the correct JSON specification of their API.
*   **Common Scenario:** This setup is typical for FastAPI, Flask, Django REST Framework, or similar web frameworks where an endpoint (often `/docs`, `/redoc`, or in this case, implicitly `/api`) serves the API documentation UI.*

*   **Request Headers:**
    *   `accept: application/json` (Client expects a JSON response)
    *   `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` (Indicates the request payload is form data)
*   **Request Body / Form Data:**
    *   A form field named `question` with the value: "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/". This suggests the API is a question-answering system.

**3. Server Response Details:**
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200` (Success - OK)
*   **Response Body (transcribed exactly):**
    ```json
    {
        "answer": "https://shashikumarhohir.github.io/my-portfolio/"
    }
    ```
    *   The response is a JSON object containing a single key `answer`, which provides a GitHub Pages URL (`https://shashikumarhohir.github.io/my-portfolio/`) as the answer to the posed question.
*   **Response Headers (transcribed exactly):**
    ```
    access-control-allow-credentials: true
    access-control-allow-origin: https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com
    connection: keep-alive
    content-length: 61
    content-type: application/json
    date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:39:00 GMT
    server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
    vary: Origin
    ```
    *   Key headers confirm the content type of the response (`application/json`), CORS settings (`access-control-allow-origin`), and the server software (`nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)`). The `date` header shows a future date (Mon, 14 Apr 2025), which might be an anomaly or specific configuration.

**Key Takeaways for a Data Science Course Forum:**
*   This demonstrates a successful interaction with an API that appears to be a basic question-answering system or a knowledge retrieval service.
*   The API is hosted on Microsoft Azure (`cloudapp.azure.com`).
*   The use of `multipart/form-data` for the request and `application/json` for the response is clearly shown.
*   The `curl` command provides a complete example of how to interact with this API from the command line.
*   The output shows a specific, valid answer to a natural language question, indicating the API is functional and processes the input as intended.*



Thanks,  
Shashi

Sir the same issue occurred on my end as well. My endpoint is returning the correct output, as demonstrated by [@SK76](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/sk76) . However, it has still been marked as 0.  
Could you please check whether the evaluation is still in progress or has been finalized? I would appreciate any update on the status.

Sir,  
I have submitted the working url but forgot to add /api in the end. Please consider my request and evaluate this below link. This below link is same as the submitted link just with /api.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Google Form used in a data science course, likely for project submissions. It collects links to student work and associated deployment details.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Form Type and Rules:**
    *   It is a Google Form, as indicated by the footer "Create your own Google Form" and "Does this form look suspicious? Report".
    *   Only one response is allowed per user, but responses can be corrected after submission.
    *   The user's email ID is automatically recorded upon submission.

2.  **User Identity:**
    *   The email ID recorded for the submission is `24f2006749@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This suggests the user is a student at IIT Madras, specifically in a Data Science (`ds.study`) program.

3.  **Project Submission Requirements:**
    *   **GitHub Repository Link (Project 2):** The form requires the link to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2". An example format (`https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`) is provided.
    *   **API Endpoint Link:** The form requires the link to the student's API endpoint. It explicitly states that a POST request must be successfully sent to this URL.

4.  **Student's Submitted Data:**
    *   **GitHub Link:** The student (whose GitHub username appears to be `Sakshi6749`) has submitted the link: `https://github.com/Sakshi6749/PROJECT-2`.
    *   **API Endpoint Link:** The student has submitted the link: `saakshi-llama.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`. This indicates the API is hosted on Microsoft Azure, specifically in the "Central India" region.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Submission Policy Text:**
    ```
    You can submit only one response.
    You can correct your response after you
    submit.
    Your email (24f2006749@ds.study.iitm.ac.
    in) was recorded when you submitted this
    form.
    ```
*   **Question 1 (GitHub Link) and Response:**
    *   **Question:** `What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *`
    *   **Example Format:** `It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`
    *   **User's Input:** `https://github.com/Sakshi6749/PROJECT-2`
*   **Question 2 (API Endpoint) and Response:**
    *   **Question:** `What is the link to your API endpoint? *`
    *   **Instruction:** `Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL`
    *   **User's Input:** `saakshi-llama.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`
*   **Footer Text:**
    ```
    Create your own Google Form
    Does this form look suspicious? Report
    ```*

2 days back I got my TDS Project-2 Score and it is showing as absent although I submitted my TDS project 2 , also deployed the app successfully and also filled the g-form

Here‚Äôs my deployed application on-render link with the attached screenshot of my TDS Dashboard:

Project : <https://tds-project2-21f3000591.onrender.com/>



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a student's progress and grade summary for an online data science course, likely from a learning management system (LMS) or a similar educational platform.

Here's the key information:

**Course Information:**
*   **Course Title:** Tools in Data Science
*   **Course Status:** NEW COURSE (suggesting it might be a new offering or the student's recent enrollment)

**Assignment Performance:**
The student's performance on weekly assignments is detailed:
*   Week 1 Assignment - 92.50
*   Week 2 Assignment - 90.00
*   Week 3 Assignment - 0.00 (Indicates a missed or unsubmitted assignment)
*   Week 4 Assignment - 100.00
*   Week 5 Assignment - 100.00
*   Week 6 Assignment - Absent (Indicates a missed or unsubmitted assignment)
*   Week 7 Assignment - Absent (Indicates a missed or unsubmitted assignment)
*   **Average Assignment for final Scoring - 96.00** (Despite the "0.00" and "Absent" marks, the calculated average for final scoring is very high, suggesting either a dropping of the lowest scores or a specific weighting scheme for assignments).

**Other Graded Components:**
*   **PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - 90.00** (A strong score on the quiz).
*   **COURSE PROJECT - 5.00** (A significantly low score for the main course project, indicating a major issue).
*   **Course Project Score 2 - Absent** (Suggests there might have been multiple components or attempts for the project, with the second one missed).

**Exam Eligibility:**
*   **Allowed to take End Term Exam? Yes** (Despite the very low course project score and some absent assignments, the student is eligible to take the final exam. This implies that the strong average assignment score and quiz score were sufficient to meet the eligibility criteria).

**Navigation:**
*   A button labeled "Go to Course page >" is present at the bottom, allowing the user to navigate back to the main course page.

**No code, commands, or error messages are present in this screenshot.** The content is purely a display of academic progress and grades.*

need to include the /api in the end. without that your mark will be 0 , since it cannot be evaluated without an end point

You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).

Is the marks shown on dashboard out of 20 or 100? coz i can clearly see in the logs that my api has answered all questions correctly, and my dashboard shows score of 20 for project 2.

sir i am sorry that i keep resending this same message but please clarify this alone sir.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the provided screenshot, detailing the key information and transcribing relevant text:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays an email from a data science course, `22t1 se2002`, to a student ("Learner"). The email informs the student about a re-evaluation of Project 2 (P2) due to a low initial score.

The core message is a direct instruction for the student to ensure their server endpoint is running during a specific time window for this re-evaluation.

**Main Points:**

1.  **Purpose of Email:** The course instructors have decided to re-run "P2 Evaluations" for the student's "endpoint server" because of their "low score" on the initial evaluation.
2.  **Required Action:** The student is kindly requested to **turn on** their "server endpoint."
3.  **Evaluation Time Window:** The server endpoint must be active from **11:00 pm to 02:00 am TONIGHT**. The evaluations will start at 11:00 pm and end at 2:00 am.
4.  **Server Management:** The student may turn off their server after 02:00 am and does not need to turn it on before 11:00 pm.
5.  **Endpoint Submission Rules:**
    *   Only the endpoint "submitted in the official forms" will be tested.
    *   Endpoints submitted "in discourse or via email" will **NOT** be tested.
6.  **Endpoint Selection Logic:**
    *   If the student submitted an updated endpoint in the "latest form" sent by the instructors, that updated endpoint will be tested.
    *   Otherwise, the "previous endpoint" submitted by the student will be used.
7.  **Confirmed Endpoint:** The email explicitly states the exact endpoint that will be tested is provided in the email itself, emphasizing that **no other endpoint will be tested.**

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no traditional code, commands, or error messages in this email. However, the specific server endpoint URL, which functions as a critical command/target for the evaluation, is transcribed below:

**Server Endpoint (URL):**
`https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4f92-fe5a-309e.ngrok.free.app/ask`*



the mail i got mentions that no other endpoint will be tested and it is showing the old ngrok link. now if i edit the form and change the url will you consider the new one? please clarify sir‚Ä¶

*April 16, 2025, 13:31 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a mobile phone screen showing a portion of a Google Form, likely used for project submission in a data science course. The interface indicates it's being viewed within an email application or a web browser on a mobile device.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Context:**
*   **Time:** `18:59`
*   **Device Status:** Wi-Fi connected, strong cellular signal, 98% battery.
*   **Application Interface:** Standard mobile application header (back arrow, download, trash, email, more options). A reply bar at the bottom with attachment, reply, and emoji options, and an email icon showing `99+` unread notifications.
*   **Form Type:** A Google Form, as indicated by the footer text "Create your own Google Form" and "Does this form look suspicious? Report."

**Form Content (Project Submission Details):**

1.  **Question 1: GitHub Repository Link**
    *   **Prompt:** `What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *` (The asterisk indicates a required field).
    *   **Guidance/Example Format:** `It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`
    *   **Submitted Link:** `https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final`
    *   **Analysis:** This question requires students to submit the GitHub repository containing the code for their "Project 2." The provided link belongs to a user named `kartikayy1` and the repository is `project2final`. This suggests the project involves code development and version control.

2.  **Question 2: API Endpoint Link**
    *   **Prompt:** `What is the link to your API endpoint? *` (The asterisk indicates a required field).
    *   **Guidance:** `Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL`
    *   **Submitted Link:** `https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/`
    *   **Analysis:** This question is crucial for data science projects that involve deploying models or services. It indicates that "Project 2" requires students to build and deploy an API. The instruction to ensure `POST` requests can be sent implies the API is expected to receive data (e.g., for prediction, processing). The provided link is hosted on Vercel, a popular platform for deploying web applications and APIs, further confirming the deployment aspect of the project. The `-beta` in the URL suggests it might be a staging or testing version of the API.

**Inferred Data Science Course Context:**
The form clearly indicates that "Project 2" in this data science course involves:
*   Developing code and managing it on GitHub.
*   Deploying an application or machine learning model as an API.
*   The API must be capable of handling `POST` requests, likely for inference or data submission.

The purpose of this form is to collect these essential links from students for assessment or evaluation of their project.*

This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant setback, potentially requiring me to repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine ‚Äî a small yet critical one ‚Äî and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot.

[tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/)

### [TDS Solver](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/)

but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:

Dear Sirs,

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.

I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as ‚ÄúAbsent,‚Äù despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.

For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.

I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.

I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Respected Sir,  
Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:  
currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/`

but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/`

I‚Äôm sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL

Thank you

actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir

hello sir,  
the link have submitted has a UI interface for solving the question which looks somewhat like this  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user interface for a web-based tool or application, likely intended for use within a data science course forum. It appears to be an interactive solver or assistant, specifically named "TDS GA Solver."

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Application Title:**
*   **"TDS GA Solver"**: This is the prominent title at the top of the page. "TDS" could stand for "The Data Science" or a similar course/platform name, while "GA" likely refers to a specific concept or area within data science, such as "Genetic Algorithms," "General Analytics," or perhaps even "Graduate Assistant" if it's an automated tutor. The word "Solver" indicates its purpose is to provide solutions or answers.

**2. User Input - Question:**
*   **Label:** "Ask a GA Question:"
*   **Input Field:** A large, multi-line text area is provided for the user to type their query.
*   **Placeholder Text:** "Type your question here..."

**3. User Input - File Upload (Optional):**
*   **Label:** "Upload File (Optional):"
*   **Controls:** A file input element with two visible parts:
    *   A button labeled "Choose File"
    *   A text area displaying "No file chosen" (indicating no file has been selected yet).
*   **Functionality:** This section allows users to attach additional context, data, or code files relevant to their question, which can be useful for debugging or detailed problem-solving. The "(Optional)" tag clarifies that a file is not mandatory for submission.

**4. Action Button:**
*   **Button Text:** "Submit"
*   **Functionality:** This button, prominently displayed with a gradient blue-purple background, triggers the processing of the user's question and any uploaded file by the "TDS GA Solver."

**5. Output/Response Area:**
*   **Label:** "Response:"
*   **Display Area:** An empty, single-line text field is provided below the submit button.
*   **Functionality:** This area is presumably where the "TDS GA Solver" will display its answer, solution, or any output generated after the user's submission.

**Overall Context and Design:**
The interface features a clean, modern design with a primary color scheme of dark purple/blue and white, common in educational or technical applications. Its structure suggests an AI-powered or automated question-answering system tailored for data science queries, particularly those related to "GA" topics. It aims to provide a dedicated self-service resource for students or forum members seeking solutions or explanations.*



in order to access the endpoint we just need to add ‚Äú/api‚Äù on the end however in the form I have submitted the link without the end line.  
Please Consider,  
Thanks & Regards,

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

I‚Äôm not able to restart my Virtual Machine as my Azure subscription has expired and my account is disabled.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email from Microsoft Azure, likely concerning a user's expired free tier subscription.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Sender & Recipient:**
*   **Sender:** Microsoft Azure <azure-noreply@microsoft.com>
*   **Recipient:** To: You

**2. Date & Time:**
*   **Sent:** Tue 4/15/2025 3:39 AM

**3. Subject/Headline:**
*   **Text:** "Upgrade now to keep building in Azure"

**4. Core Message/Problem:**
*   The user's "free credit has expired," leading to their "subscription and services" being "disabled."

**5. Proposed Solution:**
*   Upgrade to a "pay-as-you-go subscription" to retain "configured services and data in place."

**6. Benefits/Incentives for Upgrading:**
*   "12 months of popular products for free."
*   "More than 25 products that are always free."
*   For other services, only pay for usage each month.
*   "It's easy to cancel, any time."

**7. Call to Action (CTA):**
*   A prominent blue button: "Sign up for a new subscription >"

**8. Data Retention Warning/Deadline:**
*   Azure will keep subscription data before "permanently deleting it on April 14, 2025."
*   Users are advised to "log in and save any important data before then."
*   **Crucial Implication:** The email was sent on April 15, 2025, which is *after* the stated permanent deletion date of April 14, 2025. This means the user's data might already be permanently deleted, or is imminently at risk.

**9. Incomplete Information:**
*   The very last line visible is cut off: "Resume using your"

**Relevance to a Data Science Course Forum:**
This type of email is highly relevant for a data science course forum because students often utilize free cloud credits (like Azure's) for projects, assignments, and learning. An email like this would prompt questions such as:
*   How to upgrade their subscription without losing project data.
*   Whether their data is already gone given the date discrepancy.
*   Best practices for managing cloud resources and avoiding service interruptions.
*   How to back up data from Azure if they don't want to upgrade.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
*   There are **no code, commands, or explicit error messages** present in this screenshot. The content is a standard notification email.*



Please suggest the way forward.

Dear Sir,

I‚Äôm sorry to bother you again, but I‚Äôm in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel.

As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as ‚Äúabsent,‚Äù even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation.

I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest.

\***Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint**

Dear [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

I hope you‚Äôre doing well!

I‚Äôm currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at:

```
https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/

```

However, I‚Äôm encountering the following error:

```
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app

```

After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using **public DNS services** like **Google (8.8.8.8)** or **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).

---

### Suggested Fix:

To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a **public DNS** provider?

Recommended options:

* **Google DNS**: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`
* **Cloudflare DNS**: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`

This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment‚Äôs networking configuration.

---

### Alternate Option:

If the DNS change isn‚Äôt possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the **previously deployed endpoint** instead:

```
https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/

```

Please note that this endpoint may take **50 to 60 seconds** to respond, as it‚Äôs hosted on a platform with a cold start delay ‚Äî but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.

Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.

---

Thank you so much for your time and support ‚Äî I truly appreciate the effort you‚Äôre putting into helping us succeed in this course!

Best regards,  
**Sahil Raj**

Dear [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. <https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/>  
whereas the correct api for giving post requests has **/api** added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e\*\*.[https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/\*\*](https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**)  
I have checked again and the post requests are working.

Hi Jivraj,

I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.

At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it‚Äôs not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.

Additionally, I believe the image may show your server‚Äôs IP address.

Thank you!  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the output from a Windows PowerShell terminal, likely running a script or application related to a data science course or project. The output logs various activities, including file processing, API interactions, and system evaluations.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The activity is occurring within a **Windows PowerShell** terminal window.
2.  **Application Name:** Log entries frequently reference `tds_app`, which likely stands for "The Data Science App" or a similar program.
3.  **Core Functionality - File Processing & Evaluation:**
    *   The system appears to be processing Python (`.py`) files located in a structured directory `E://data science tool//GAx//`.
    *   It identifies files as "question with file" and then subsequently provides a "solution for" the same file, suggesting an automated evaluation or solution generation process.
    *   Files are associated with `score` and `confidence` metrics (e.g., `score: 0.41, confidence: 40%`). This strongly indicates an automated grading, performance evaluation, or prediction system for data science models or solutions.
4.  **API Interaction:**
    *   There are multiple log entries showing successful HTTP POST requests to an `/api/` endpoint, confirmed by the `200 OK` status. This suggests a web service component, possibly for submitting tasks, retrieving results, or interacting with external services.
    *   The IP address `103.158.43.22` is repeatedly logged as accessing the `/api/` endpoint.
5.  **Contexts/Integrations:** The `in:` lines (e.g., `in: openai`, `in: github`, `in: excel`) suggest the system might be handling data or tasks related to:
    *   **OpenAI:** Potentially involving AI models, natural language processing, or services from OpenAI.
    *   **GitHub:** A line indicating `GitHub Pages query -> GA2/third.py` suggests integration with GitHub, possibly for pulling code, submitting work, or web-based queries.
    *   **Excel:** Implies processing or generating data in Excel format, or working with tabular data typically found in spreadsheets.
6.  **Specific Files Processed:** The log shows processing for files like `eighteenth.py`, `second.py`, `third.py`, and `sixth.py` across different `GA` (likely "Group A" or similar) subdirectories.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven‚Äôt received the same.

Hi [@afsalshah](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/afsalshah)

You submitted google form with wrong email address.  
This was the email address you used for filling form.

quizapp.mad2@gmail.com

Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered ‚Äî I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.  
I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.

We didn‚Äôt account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.

Anyone who didn‚Äôt use their IITM email during submission‚Äîeven if they later filled out the form‚Äîwas filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

Hi Team,

Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our **Project 2** would be **reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight**, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:

<https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/>

However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as **0**.

Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated?

Thank you!

Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a Google Form, likely used for submission or evaluation in a data science course. The form is designed to collect specific URLs related to a student's "Project 2".

**Key Information:**

1.  **GitHub Repository Link:**
    *   **Question:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *"
    *   **Guidance:** "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   **Context:** This is a required field where the student needs to provide the URL to their GitHub repository containing the source code for their second project.
    *   **Transcribed Link/Code:**
        ```
        https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final
        ```

2.  **API Endpoint Link:**
    *   **Question:** "What is the link to your API endpoint? *"
    *   **Instruction:** "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   **Context:** This is also a required field, asking for the URL where the project's API is deployed. The instruction about accepting "POST requests" is crucial, indicating that the API is expected to receive data for processing (e.g., model inference, data submission). The provided link suggests deployment on Vercel.
    *   **Transcribed Link/Code:**
        ```
        https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/
        ```

**General Observations:**

*   The form itself is identified as a Google Form (indicated by "Create your own Google Form" and "Does this form look suspicious? Report" at the bottom).
*   Both questions are marked with an asterisk (\*), signifying they are required fields.
*   The screenshot shows mobile interface elements, including the current time (18:59), battery level (98%), network status, and general email/messaging icons.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Google Form presented within a mobile email client or browser, originating from an academic institution, likely related to a data science course.

## Key Information:

1.  **Purpose of the Form:** To allow students to update their "URL endpoints" due to changes or grievances. It aims to streamline the process of managing these endpoints.
2.  **User Identification:** The form confirms that the user's email, `23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, was recorded upon submission. This indicates the user is a student from an IIT Madras data science study program.
3.  **Required Action:** The user is asked to "Please provide your updated endpoint." This field is marked with a red asterisk (`*`), indicating it is mandatory.
4.  **Submission Instructions:**
    *   If an endpoint changes, users are explicitly told to **edit the form they have already submitted** to provide the latest endpoint.
    *   A strong instruction is given: **"Do not submit multiple forms."**
5.  **Example/Placeholder Endpoint:** A specific URL is provided, which appears to be a Vercel-hosted API endpoint related to a project or service.
6.  **Form Type:** The footer "Create your own Google Form" confirms it is a Google Form. There's also an option to report if the form looks suspicious.
7.  **Context (Inferred):** Given the email domain (`ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) and the nature of "URL endpoints" and "API," this form is likely used in a data science course at IIT Madras for submitting project outputs, models, or assignments that require an accessible URL for evaluation (e.g., an API endpoint for an LLM model, as suggested by `llm` in the URL). The mention of "grievances" suggests there might have been previous issues with endpoint submission or management that this form aims to resolve.

## Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   **Email Address:** `23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Example Endpoint URL:** `tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api`
*   There are no explicit error messages displayed in the screenshot.*

Yes, the new page took about 5‚Äì10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.  
If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.  
In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.

However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.

I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.

I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.  
I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.

To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a command-line interaction with an API designed to solve or evaluate Google Sheets formulas. The user is querying a "tds-solver" API hosted on Vercel.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The interaction takes place in a PowerShell terminal on a Windows machine (`PS C:\Users\anshu>`).
2.  **API Call:** The user is making an HTTP POST request to an endpoint: `https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/`.
3.  **Tool Used:** The `httpie` command-line tool (`http`) is used to make the request, specified with the `-f` flag for form data.
4.  **Input Question:** A multi-line question is sent as a `question` parameter to the API. This question contains a Google Sheets formula that needs to be evaluated.
    *   The formula is: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 7), 1, 10))`.
    *   It's explicitly noted that this formula is intended for Google Sheets and "It won't work in Excel", indicating a potential difference in spreadsheet function compatibility.
5.  **API Response:** The API responds with a successful HTTP status (`200 OK`).
    *   The response is JSON formatted (`Content-Type: application/json`).
    *   The API reports that the operation was a `success`.
    *   The calculated `answer` for the given Google Sheets formula is `465`.
6.  **Server Details:** The API is hosted on Vercel, and the response headers include Vercel-specific information (`X-Vercel-Cache: MISS`, `X-Vercel-Id`).
7.  **Date and Time:** The API response was generated on `Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:23:01 GMT`.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the ‚Äú/api‚Äù path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.

To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated ‚Äî using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields ‚Äî I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I‚Äôd like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

For reference, I‚Äôve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) array containing results from multiple API calls, likely related to an automated testing or submission system within a data science course.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The output appears to be a log or response from a system designed to grade or evaluate submissions for different "test codes" (e.g., `GA1_q18`, `GA4_q6`, etc.). These codes likely correspond to specific assignments or questions within a course (e.g., "Graded Assignment 1, Question 18").
2.  **API Endpoint:** All requests are directed to the same API endpoint: `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`. This suggests a "File Q&A" application hosted on Vercel, which would typically handle file uploads and processing for evaluation.
3.  **Consistent Failure:** Every single test case shown in the array has a `status` of "FAILED".
4.  **Common Error Message:** The `error` message is identical for all failed attempts: `HTTP 400: {\"error\":\"Missing question or file\"}`.
    *   **HTTP 400 Bad Request:** This status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
    *   **"Missing question or file":** This specific internal error message strongly suggests that the API request made by the user's script or tool either did not include the necessary file (e.g., a solution notebook, a dataset) or did not correctly specify the `question` (i.e., the `test_code`) that the submitted file relates to. It implies the problem is with the input provided by the student, not necessarily a server-side bug.
5.  **Context for a Data Science Course Forum:** A student posting this screenshot would likely be asking why their assignments are consistently failing. The expert advice would focus on:
    *   Verifying that the correct files are being uploaded or are present in the expected location.
    *   Checking if the file names or types match what the system expects.
    *   Ensuring the submission command or script correctly passes all required parameters (e.g., the file itself, the assignment/question identifier).
    *   Confirming that the `test_code`s being used are valid for the current assignment.

**Transcription:**

```

    "api": "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/",
    "test_code": "GA1_q18",

> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

This screenshot displays an API testing interface (likely Postman or a similar tool) showing a user attempting to make a `POST` request to an API endpoint and the resulting error.

**Key Information:**

1.  **API Endpoint and Method:**
    *   The request is being sent to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` using the `POST` HTTP method.

2.  **Request Configuration:**
    *   The "Body" tab is active, and the request body type is set to `form-data`. This is commonly used for sending mixed data types, including files (multipart/form-data).
    *   Two potential parameters are visible: `question` and `file`.
    *   The `question` parameter has a value of `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...` but its checkbox is **unchecked**, meaning it is *not* being sent with the request. The user has explicitly annotated this with "Sending request without Question".
    *   The `file` parameter has its checkbox **checked** and is configured to send a file named `abcd.zip`.

3.  **API Response:**
    *   **HTTP Status Code:** The server responded with `400 Bad Request`. This indicates that the server could not process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax, invalid request parameters, or missing required data).
    *   **Response Body Format:** The response body is in `JSON` format.
    *   **Response Time & Size:** The request took `1.92 s` and the response size was `433 B`.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Request Body Type:** `form-data`
*   **Request Parameter (unchecked):** `question` (with value: `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...`)
*   **Request Parameter (checked):** `file` (with value: `abcd.zip`)
*   **Response Status:** `400 Bad Request`
*   **Response JSON Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Missing question or file"
    }
    ```
*   **User Annotations:**
    *   "Sending request without Question" (referring to the unchecked `question` parameter)
    *   "Response same as evaluvation" (referring to the `400 Bad Request` and the `Missing question or file` error message)

**Analysis of the Problem:**

The user is intentionally sending a `POST` request without the "question" parameter, while including the "file" parameter. The server responds with a `400 Bad Request` and a specific error message: `"Missing question or file"`. This indicates that:

1.  The API requires either the `question` parameter, the `file` parameter, or potentially both for a valid request.
2.  In this specific case, even though the `file` parameter was sent, the API's validation logic determined that the request was invalid because the `question` parameter (or a combination including it) was expected or required, and was explicitly omitted. The user's note "Response same as evaluvation" suggests they are trying to debug why their request might be failing in an automated evaluation system, and this particular error message is consistent with what they've observed elsewhere.

The implication is that for this `fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint, a `question` parameter is mandatory, even if a `file` is also provided, or at least one of them must be present, and the check for `question` failed. Given the name "fileqa-app" (file Question Answering), it's highly likely both are expected for a successful query.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum illustrates an API request being made using an API client (likely Postman or a similar tool). It highlights a specific scenario where a request is sent without a required parameter, and the server's expected error response is received.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Endpoint and Method:**
*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`

**2. Request Details (Body Tab - form-data):**
*   The request body type is set to `form-data`.
*   **Parameter 1:**
    *   **Key:** `question`
    *   **Value:** `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...`
    *   **Status:** This parameter is checked and included in the request.
*   **Parameter 2:**
    *   **Key:** `file`
    *   **Value:** `abcd.zip` (with a warning icon, indicating it's perhaps not ready or found locally)
    *   **Status:** This parameter's checkbox is **unchecked**, meaning it is *not* being sent with the request, despite being defined in the interface.
*   **User Annotation:** An arrow points from "Sending req without file" to the unchecked `file` parameter, explicitly stating the purpose of this particular test case.

**3. Response Details:**
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`
*   **Response Time:** `774 ms`
*   **Response Size:** `433 B`
*   **Response Body Type:** `JSON`
*   **Transcribed Error Message:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Missing question or file"
    }
    ```
*   **User Annotation:** An arrow points from "response same as evaluvation report" (note the typo "evaluvation" in the original annotation) to the `400 Bad Request` status and the JSON error message. This suggests that the user is validating the API's behavior against a known or expected result from an "evaluation report."

**Summary of the Scenario:**
The user is intentionally sending a `POST` request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` with a `question` parameter but *without* the `file` parameter. The API responds with a `400 Bad Request` status and a JSON error message indicating that either a "question" or a "file" (or both, implicitly) are required for the request to be valid. This demonstrates the API's input validation for missing essential parameters.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a successful API request and response using an API client, most likely Postman, targeting a file-based question-answering service.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Request Details:**
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Body Type:** `form-data` is selected, which is typically used for sending complex data, including file uploads, as `multipart/form-data`.
*   **Parameters Sent in Body:**
    *   **Key:** `question`
        *   **Type:** Text
        *   **Value:** `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...` (The value is truncated in the screenshot.)
    *   **Key:** `file`
        *   **Type:** File
        *   **Value:** `abcd.zip` (Indicates a file named "abcd.zip" was uploaded.)
*   **User Annotation:** The red arrow and text "Sent req with file/question both" confirm that both the textual question and the `abcd.zip` file were included in the request payload.

**2. Response Details:**
*   **Status Code:** `200 OK` (Green background, indicating a successful request).
    *   **User Annotation:** The red arrow and text "Expected res code" pointing to `200 OK` suggest that this successful status was anticipated by the user.
*   **Response Time:** `868 ms`
*   **Response Size:** `410 B`
*   **Response Body Format:** JSON is selected and displayed.

**3. Transcribed Response Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "answer": "1234567890"
}
```
*   **User Annotation:** The red arrow and text "Expected response" pointing to the JSON content `{"answer": "1234567890"}` indicate that this specific JSON structure and value was the desired and received output from the API.

**Summary:** The screenshot demonstrates a successful interaction with a file QA API. A `POST` request was sent with both a question and a `.zip` file. The API responded with a `200 OK` status and a JSON object containing the expected `"answer"` with the value `"1234567890"`. This suggests the API successfully processed the question and the provided file to extract the answer.*

### Post #682 by **Aditya goyal** (ds-students)
*April 17, 2025, 13:42 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a JSON array containing two objects, each representing the result of an API test or request.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Overall Structure:** The output is a JSON array, indicating a collection of results. Each element in the array is a JSON object describing a single test outcome.
2.  **API Endpoint:** Both tests are hitting the same API endpoint: `https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/`. The URL suggests it's a project hosted on Vercel, likely part of a "solver" or assessment system by a user named "aditya."
3.  **Test Identifiers:**
    *   The first object corresponds to `test_code: "GA1_q18"`, which likely stands for "General Assessment 1, question 18."
    *   The second object corresponds to `test_code: "GA4_q6"`, likely "General Assessment 4, question 6."
4.  **Status:** Both tests have a `status` of `"FAILED"`.
5.  **Error Message:** For both failed tests, the `error` message is identical:
    *   It indicates an "HTTP 405: Method Not Allowed" error. This is a standard HTTP status code meaning the HTTP method used in the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is not supported by the server for the specified URL.
    *   The error message includes HTML content (`<!doctype html>...`), which is typically returned by a web server to display an error page in a browser, but here it's encapsulated within the JSON string.
    *   The core message within the HTML is "The method is not allowed for the requested URL."

**In summary:** The screenshot shows two separate tests failing due to an "HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed" error when attempting to interact with the same Vercel-hosted API endpoint. This suggests the client (the testing system) is likely using an incorrect HTTP method (e.g., sending a GET request when a POST is expected, or vice versa) for these API calls.

### Post #683 by **Sathya ** (ds-students)
*April 17, 2025, 13:43 UTC*
For further more clarification to prove my endpoint is working as expected.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot depicts an API client (likely Postman or Insomnia) being used to test an endpoint for a data science application, specifically focusing on its error handling for invalid file inputs.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **API Endpoint and Method:**
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`

2.  **Request Body Configuration:**
    *   The request body is configured as `form-data`, which is commonly used for sending files and other data in a single request.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   **Key:** `question`
            *   **Value Type:** `Text`
            *   **Value:** `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...` (This indicates a natural language query for a data analysis task).
        *   **Key:** `file`
            *   **Value Type:** `File`
            *   **Value:** `q-move-rename-files.zip` (This is the name of the uploaded ZIP file).
            *   A warning icon (`‚ö†Ô∏è`) next to the filename suggests an issue with the file, which is clarified by the user's annotation.

3.  **User's Intent (Annotations):**
    *   **Annotation 1:** "Changed the zip file which doesnt having any CSV."
        *   This explains that the user intentionally uploaded a `.zip` file (`q-move-rename-files.zip`) that *does not* contain any `.csv` files. This is a deliberate test case to validate the API's error handling.

4.  **API Response:**
    *   **HTTP Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`
    *   **Response Time:** `846 ms`
    *   **Response Size:** `434 B`
    *   **Response Body Format:** `JSON` (selected)

5.  **Transcribed Error Message (Response Body):**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "No CSV file found in zip."
    }
    ```

6.  **User's Outcome (Annotation):**
    *   **Annotation 2:** "Got the expected error response :)"
        *   This confirms that the API behaved as expected by returning a specific error when the required CSV file was not found within the provided ZIP archive. The user is satisfied with this validation of the error handling.

In summary, the screenshot demonstrates a successful test case for an API's robust error handling, where the API correctly identified and reported the absence of a required CSV file within an uploaded ZIP archive, preventing further processing of an invalid input.*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a successful API call being made using an API testing client (likely Postman, given its interface) to a "File QA" application. The user is demonstrating that the system correctly processes updated file content.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Endpoint and Method:**
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api`

**2. Request Details (Body Tab):**
*   **Body Type:** `form-data` is selected, indicating that the request includes mixed data types, typically used for file uploads.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   **Key:** `question`
        *   **Type:** `Text`
        *   **Value:** `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...` (The full question is truncated, but it's a natural language query.)
    *   **Key:** `file`
        *   **Type:** `File` (This confirms a file is being uploaded.)
        *   **Value:** `abcd.zip` (There's a small warning triangle icon next to `abcd.zip`, which might indicate a placeholder, a file not found locally when the screenshot was taken, or just a generic icon for file input, but it did not prevent the successful request.)
*   **User Context/Intent (Annotation):**
    *   `Updated the zip with new csv file with diff value`
        *   This annotation clarifies that the `abcd.zip` file was modified internally (e.g., a CSV file inside it was updated with a new data value) before being sent, to test if the API would process the *new* content.

**3. Response Details (Body Tab - JSON Output):**
*   **Status Code:** `200 OK` (Indicates a successful request).
*   **Response Time:** `1.16 s`
*   **Response Size:** `410 B`
*   **Response Body Type:** `JSON`
*   **JSON Response Content (transcribed exactly):**
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "3812934199"
    }
    ```
*   **User Confirmation (Annotation):**
    *   `Got expected answer.`
        *   This confirms that the numerical value `3812934199` is the desired output, suggesting the API successfully extracted this specific answer from the updated `abcd.zip` file based on the question posed.

**Summary of Key Information:**
The user is demonstrating a successful interaction with a file-based question-answering API. They sent a `POST` request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api` with two `form-data` parameters: a `question` (natural language) and a `file` (`abcd.zip`). Crucially, the `abcd.zip` file was intentionally updated with new data to test the API's ability to handle changes in input files. The API responded with a `200 OK` status and a JSON object containing the `answer` as `3812934199`, which the user confirms was the "expected answer." This indicates that the API correctly processed the updated content within the `abcd.zip` file.*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an interaction with an API endpoint, likely for a "file question-answering" application. The user is deliberately testing an edge case to observe the API's error handling.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. API Request Details:**
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Request Body Type:** `form-data` is selected.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   **`question` (Text field):** `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...` (The full question is truncated, but it clearly refers to an "answer" column).
    *   **`file` (File field):** `def.zip`
        *   **User's Annotation:** A red arrow points to the file input with the text: `Zip with new csv without any values. just having columns names`. This is crucial context, indicating the `def.zip` file contains a CSV that only has column headers and no actual data rows, specifically without values in the "answer" column.

**2. API Response Details:**
*   **Response Format:** `JSON`
*   **Response Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Answer column not found or empty."
    }
    ```
*   **HTTP Status Code:** Faintly visible above the JSON response, the status is `400 Bad Request`.
*   **User's Annotation:** A red arrow points to the JSON response with the text: `Expected error answer :)`. This confirms the user intentionally sent a malformed or incomplete input (the empty CSV within the zip) to trigger this specific error message, verifying the API's robust handling of such cases.

**Summary of Interaction:**
The user is sending a POST request to an API to ask a question about data within a file. They are intentionally providing a `def.zip` file containing a CSV that has column headers but no data (especially for the "answer" column, which the question references). The API correctly identifies this issue and returns a `400 Bad Request` with a JSON error message stating `"Answer column not found or empty."`, which the user anticipated and seemingly desired as a test result. This indicates a successful test of the API's error handling for missing or empty data in a critical column.*



If there are any additional scenarios you‚Äôd like me to test, feel free to let me know, I‚Äôd be happy to help validate that the endpoint is functioning as expected.

### Post #684 by **Manu C** (ds-students)
*April 17, 2025, 13:47 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum, detailing the key information and exact transcriptions.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The image displays a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted response, likely from an API or a system log within a data science course environment.
2.  **API Endpoint:** The response originates from the API endpoint: `https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/`. This suggests a web-based application or service hosted on Vercel.
3.  **Test/Question Identifier:** The `test_code` field indicates that this error occurred for a specific test or question identified as `GA1_q18`. This is highly relevant for a course forum, as it points to a particular assignment problem.
4.  **Status:** The `status` field clearly shows `"ERROR"`, meaning the operation or query failed.
5.  **Error Type:** The core problem is a "syntax error" in a SQL query.
6.  **Problematic SQL (and its presentation):** The `error` message provides details about the SQL query that failed. It appears the system received a string that included the literal text `\sql\n` before the actual SQL query. The intended SQL query (without the `\sql\n` prefix) is:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(price * units) AS total_sales
    FROM tickets
    WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';
    ```
    This SQL query aims to calculate the total sales (`price * units`) for tickets where the `type` is 'gold' (case-insensitively).

7.  **Likely Cause:** The presence of `\sql\n` at the beginning of the SQL string, followed by a "syntax error", strongly suggests that this non-SQL prefix was mistakenly included with the actual SQL query when it was sent for execution. This could be due to:
    *   An issue in the application code constructing the query string.
    *   A bug in the system that prepends diagnostic or structural information (`\sql\n`) incorrectly as part of the query itself.
    *   The student's input accidentally including this extraneous text if they were directly typing the query.

**Transcription (Exact):**

```
{
    "api": "https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/",
    "test_code": "GA1_q18",
    "status": "ERROR",
    "error": "near \\"\\\"\\\\sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(price * units) AS total_sales\\\\nFROM tickets\\\\nWHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';\\\\n'\\\"": syntax error"
}
```*



  
the answer is correct expect for extra spaces it was told that those spaces are neglectable still it showed as error plz consider this [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

Case 3: JSON Key Count ‚Äì XF Parameter (GA5\_q7)

{

‚Äúapi‚Äù: ‚Äú<https://app.algsoch.tech/api/>‚Äù,

#### What Was Expected:

The question required developing a script that:

* Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and
* Counts how many times a specific key ‚Äî represented by XF ‚Äî appears in the JSON structure.

It was explicitly stated that:

* Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.
* The file to be used was:  
  E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json

#### What I Did:

I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.

Here‚Äôs the actual response I got using this cURL command:

curl -X POST <https://app.algsoch.tech/api/> \

-H ‚Äúaccept: application/json‚Äù \

-F ‚Äúquestion=‚Ä¶How many times does XF appear as a key?‚Äù \

-F ‚Äúfile=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json‚Äù

API Output:{‚Äúanswer‚Äù:‚Äú14602‚Äù}

This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.

#### What Went Wrong on API Side:

The API returned a parsing error, indicating:

‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù

However:

* My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.
* The actual issue seems to be on the API‚Äôs side ‚Äî possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.
* It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.

#### Insight:

If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.

However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a JSON-formatted error response, likely from an API endpoint related to a data science or coding assignment.

### Key Information:

*   **API Endpoint:** The request was made to `https://roe-i0ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/`. This suggests a project hosted on Vercel, commonly used for serverless functions or web applications.
*   **Test/Question Identifier:** The `test_code` is `GA1_q18`, which likely refers to "General Assessment 1, question 18" in a course or testing suite.
*   **Status:** The operation resulted in an `"ERROR"`.
*   **Error Type:** A `"syntax error"` occurred.
*   **Problematic Code:** The error is associated with a SQL query. The full error message suggests that the SQL query itself was embedded within a larger string that might have been malformed when presented to the SQL interpreter.
*   **The SQL Query:** The intended SQL query appears to be:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM (price * units) AS total_sales
    FROM tickets
    WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';
    ```
    This query aims to calculate the total sales (price multiplied by units) from a table named `tickets`, specifically for entries where the `type` column (case-insensitively compared) is 'gold'.
*   **Error Context:** The "near" part of the error message, `near ""\nsql\n...[query]...\n"": syntax error`, indicates that the SQL engine encountered a syntax problem. Given the SQL query itself `SELECT SUM (price * units) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';` is generally valid SQL, the issue might stem from:
    *   How the API is wrapping or transmitting the SQL string (e.g., the `sql` prefix, or the extra quotes `""` around the query within the error string itself, or the semicolon might be problematic for the specific parser being used).
    *   A specific, non-standard SQL dialect being used by the backend.
    *   An issue with reserved keywords or function availability in the specific database environment.

### Transcription:

I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .

If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me

I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities

It will be really helpful if you can access the project

Good Afternoon Sir.  
This is regarding project 1 and project 2.

**Project-1 Evaluation**  
Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.  
Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn‚Äôt get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

**Project-2 Evaluation**  
Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.

Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.

In anticipation of quick response  
Thank You

Hi everyone,

I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.

Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.

Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Kind regards,

TDS Team

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a communication from a data science course, likely from IIT Madras, regarding an issue with "TDS Project 2 Endpoints." The user is viewing what appears to be a Google Form or a similar submission interface within their Gmail inbox, with an option to "Edit response," indicating they have previously submitted to this form.

Here's the key information:

**1. Context:**
*   The communication is an official message from an educational institution (IIT Madras, as seen in the top right profile icon and the email domain).
*   It is being viewed in a Gmail interface, within an email or a form linked from an email.
*   The user has multiple tabs open related to "Project 2" and "TDS" (TDS Solver, TDS Project 2, etc.), indicating active engagement with the course.
*   The system date is shown as 18-04-2025.

**2. Purpose of the Communication:**
*   To inform students about "major operational changes in the backend" that have caused "unforeseen delays in conducting the evaluations of Project 2 Endpoints."
*   To request students to update their project endpoint URLs due to these changes.

**3. Problem Description:**
*   Backend operational changes necessitated that some students "restart your servers or enact some other changes to your servers in order to keep the endpoints alive."
*   This may have resulted in the students' "URLs changing."

**4. Solution/Required Action:**
*   A form has been created "to update your endpoints" and "accommodate your grievances."
*   Students are instructed to provide their updated endpoint.
*   **Crucial Instruction:** Students who have already submitted are explicitly told to **edit their existing submission** instead of submitting a new one.

**5. User-Specific Details:**
*   The email address associated with the submission being viewed is `23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This confirms the user is viewing their own previous entry.
*   The prominent "Edit response" button suggests the user is in the process of, or intends to, update their previously submitted information.

**6. Transcribed Text (Code, Commands, or Error Messages - none appear as such, but key text is transcribed):**

*   **Email Title/Form Title:** "TDS Project 2 Endpoints" (The words "Project 2" are highlighted in yellow, likely by the user).
*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Paragraph 1:** "Due to some major operational changes in the backend, we have had some unforeseen delays in conducting the evaluations of Project 2 Endpoints. As a result, some of you, have had to restart your servers or enact some other changes to your servers in order to keep the endpoints alive. This may have resulted in your URLs changing."
*   **Paragraph 2:** "To streamline the process of URL endpoints changes and accommodate your grievances we have created this form for you to be able to update your endpoints. Your email address (23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form."
*   **Instruction Header:** "Please provide your updated endpoint."
*   **Important Instruction:** "If the endpoint changes, please edit this form that you have already submitted so that we can have the latest endpoint. **Do not submit multiple forms.**"*



Dear Team,

this is proof that I have successfully submitted the form and the api is still working, why am i still marked as absent? Please respond my email is 23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays log messages, likely from a web server or proxy server, showing various HTTP requests and their outcomes. The logs indicate a mix of legitimate, potentially malicious, and malformed requests.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Log Type and Severity:**
    *   The entries are labeled with "INFO:" and "WARNING:".
    *   "INFO:" messages generally indicate successful processing or standard events.
    *   "WARNING:" messages highlight issues, specifically "Invalid HTTP request received."

2.  **HTTP Request Activity:**
    *   **Common GET Requests:** Many requests are simple `GET / HTTP/1.1` for the root path and `GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1`, which are standard web browser behaviors.
    *   **Login Attempts:** One request for `GET /login HTTP/1.1` is observed.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning/Exploitation Attempts:**
        *   Multiple attempts to access `/squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi`, which is a common path targeted by attackers looking for misconfigured or vulnerable Squid proxy servers.
        *   The frequent "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings could also indicate malformed requests often associated with scanning tools or exploit attempts.
    *   **External Service Lookups:** A `GET` request to `http%3A//api.ipify.org/?format=json` is present. This is a common public API used to determine the client's external IP address.
    *   **Suspicious/Proxy Activity:** A `CONNECT www.shadowserver.org%3A443 HTTP/1.1` request appears.
        *   `CONNECT` is typically used for tunneling through proxies, often for HTTPS.
        *   Shadowserver is a well-known non-profit organization that collects and analyzes internet attack data. A direct `CONNECT` request to it from this server could indicate that the server is being used as a proxy, potentially compromised, or involved in specific security research.
    *   **HTTP Protocol Versions and Peculiarities:**
        *   Most requests use `HTTP/1.1`.
        *   One request is for `HTTP/1.0`.
        *   Several instances of `"PRI %2A HTTP/2.0"` indicate attempts to initiate or upgrade to HTTP/2 connections. `PRI %2A` (where `%2A` is the URL-encoded `*`) is part of the HTTP/2 Cleartext Upgrade mechanism.

3.  **Error Messages:**
    *   The most prevalent error is `404 Not Found`, indicating that the requested resources do not exist on the server.
    *   The frequent `Invalid HTTP request received.` warnings suggest malformed or non-compliant HTTP requests.

4.  **Source IPs:** A variety of source IP addresses are shown, indicating requests originating from numerous different clients or potential actors.

5.  **Context for Data Science:** In a data science course, this log data could be used for:
    *   **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifying patterns, anomalies, and common request types.
    *   **Security Analytics:** Detecting potential attacks, scanning activities, or compromised systems based on the nature of requests (e.g., `cachemgr.cgi` attempts, `CONNECT` requests, "invalid HTTP" errors).
    *   **Log Parsing and Feature Engineering:** Practicing extracting structured data (IP, method, path, status) from unstructured log lines.
    *   **Understanding Web Protocols:** Illustrating different HTTP methods, versions, and common error codes.

It clearly written in the project 2 in TDS portal that api must accept `POST` request, not `GET`.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

This screenshot provides instructions and an example for interacting with a web API endpoint, likely for a task involving data processing or analysis.

### Key Information:

1.  **API Endpoint URL:** The application exposes an API endpoint located at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. The `vercel.app` domain suggests it's deployed on Vercel.
2.  **Request Method:** The endpoint is designed to accept `POST` requests.
3.  **Request Body Format:** Requests to this endpoint must use `multipart/form-data` encoding. This is specified via the `Content-Type` header.
4.  **Required Parameters:**
    *   A field named `question` which contains a textual query.
    *   An optional file attachment, indicated by a field named `file`.
5.  **Example `curl` Command:** A complete `curl` command is provided to demonstrate how to make such a request, including the HTTP method, content type, and form fields.
6.  **Example Scenario:** The `question` field in the example indicates a task involving downloading and unzipping a file (`abcd.zip`) to find a `extract.csv` file inside. The question itself appears truncated ("What is t").
7.  **File Upload:** The example demonstrates uploading a local file named `abcd.zip` using the `@` prefix with the `-F` option in `curl`.

### Transcription of Code/Commands:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t" \
-F "file=@abcd.zip"
```*



It is requested to kindly look into this matter and please clarify.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the contents of a JSON file named `22f3001642.json`, likely containing results from an automated grading or testing system for a data science course. The file is being viewed on a mobile device.

The JSON structure is an array of objects, where each object represents the result of a specific test or assignment component. Each object contains at least two key-value pairs: `"test_code"` and `"status"`. In cases of failure, an `"error"` key is also present.

**Key Information:**

1.  **File Context:** The user is viewing a JSON file, indicating a structured output of test results. The file name `22f3001642.json` suggests an automatically generated or student-specific result file.
2.  **Overall Status:**
    *   Most of the listed test codes (`GA2_q3`, `GA3_q2`, `GA4_q6`, `GA5_q7`) show a `"status"` of `"PASSED"`. This indicates successful completion for these specific components.
    *   One test, `GA1_q18`, has a `"status"` of `"ERROR"`, highlighting a problem with this particular submission or test case.
3.  **Detailed Error Information (for `GA1_q18`):**
    *   **Test Code:** `GA1_q18` (Likely "Graded Assignment 1, question 18").
    *   **Status:** `ERROR`
    *   **Error Message (exact transcription):**
        ```
        "error": "near \\"```sql\\nSELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales\\nFROM tickets\\nWHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';\\n```\\": syntax error"
        ```

**Analysis of the Error:**

The error message `syntax error` is reported as occurring "near" the string ````sql\nSELECT...`. This is a critical detail.

*   The SQL query itself, `SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';`, appears to be syntactically correct SQL for calculating total sales of 'gold' type tickets from a `tickets` table.
*   However, the query is embedded within what appears to be Markdown code block delimiters: `` ```sql`` (at the beginning) and ```` ``` `` (at the end, indicated by `\n```\\"`).
*   **Expert Diagnosis:** It is highly probable that the system designed to execute the SQL query received the entire string, including these Markdown delimiters. Since `` ```sql`` is not valid SQL syntax, the SQL parser immediately encountered a `syntax error` at the very beginning of the input it received. The student likely submitted their SQL code wrapped in a Markdown code block, possibly in a text input field where only the raw SQL was expected. The solution would be to remove these ````sql` and ```` `` ` wrappers and submit only the SQL query itself.*

### Post #710 by **Vinil** (ds-students)
*April 20, 2025, 13:00 UTC*
I have received the test result of Project 2 todat afternoon, it is showing GA 2 question 2 has failed but my answer is a hardcoded url (‚Äú<https://23f2004837.github.io/>‚Äù) from the code. This url is accessible and again tested of the GA platform for the same question and it is working as expected

Code:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python file named `Q23.py` hosted on GitHub, belonging to the `TDS-Hackers/GASolver` repository, specifically within the `GA2` directory. It appears to be a solution or a component for a data science or programming course exercise.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Repository Context:** The file `Q23.py` is located in `TDS-Hackers/GASolver/GA2/Q23.py` on GitHub.
2.  **File Version:** The displayed version corresponds to commit `23f2004837`.
3.  **File Statistics:** The file consists of `132 lines` total, `105 lines of code (loc)`, and is `4.37 KB` in size.
4.  **Code Purpose:** The Python code defines an `execute` function designed to retrieve a URL based on an input `parameter` dictionary, specifically looking for an "email" key.
5.  **`cache` Dictionary:** A hardcoded dictionary named `cache` stores mappings where keys appear to be email addresses (from the `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` domain, suggesting an academic context, possibly IIT Madras) and values are corresponding URLs, likely pointing to GitHub Pages or project repositories.
6.  **Lookup Mechanism:** The function checks if the provided `parameter["email"]` exists as a key in the `cache`.
    *   If not found, it returns an error message.
    *   If found, it returns the associated URL from the `cache`.
7.  **Highlighted Element:** The URL `https://23f2004837.github.io/` on line 7 is highlighted, which is associated with the email `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. Notably, the `23f2004837` string matches the commit hash for this file, suggesting a direct linkage between a specific student's ID/email and their project URL.
8.  **Commented-out Code:** Line 5 `#return gitPortfolio(parameter["email"])` suggests that the function might have originally used a dynamic `gitPortfolio` function, which has been replaced or overridden by the hardcoded `cache` for this specific problem.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```python
1 import os, json
2
3
4 def execute(question: str, parameter):
5 #return gitPortfolio(parameter["email"])
6 cache = {
7 "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://23f2004837.github.io/",
8 "21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://digvijaysinhchudasamaih",
9 "24f2006749@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://sakshi6749.github.io/po",
10 "22f3002188@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://22f3002188.github.io/pe",
11 "22f2001590@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://22f2001590.github.io/TD"
12 }
13 if parameter["email"] not in cache:
14 return {"Enter the value in url_cache"}
15
16 return cache[parameter["email"]]
```*



url result:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from a web browser, likely showing a student's personal or project page related to a data science course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Browser URL Bar Information:**
*   **Current URL (Highlighted):** `https://23f2004837.github.io`
    *   This indicates the user is viewing a page hosted on GitHub Pages, a common platform for students and developers to host static websites (e.g., portfolios, project documentation).
    *   The `23f2004837` part likely refers to a specific user, possibly a student ID or username, whose GitHub Pages site is being displayed.
*   The browser interface shows standard navigation buttons (back, refresh) and a padlock icon, indicating an HTTPS secure connection.

**2. Page Content Information:**
The content displayed on the page consists of a repetitive string that looks like an email address or a student identifier for an academic institution.

*   **Prominent Header/Identifier:**
    `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (Displayed in a large, bold font, likely as a main heading or central piece of information).
*   **Additional Occurrences:**
    *   `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (Displayed as standard plain text).
    *   `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (Displayed as a blue, underlined hyperlink, suggesting it's a clickable email address or a link to a related profile/page).

**Analysis in the context of a Data Science Course Forum:**
*   **Student Identifier:** The string `23f2004837` strongly resembles a student ID or unique enrollment number. The "23f" might denote a specific academic year or batch (e.g., Fall 2023).
*   **Institutional Domain:** The domain `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` clearly points to an official educational platform. "IITM" refers to the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and "ds.study" suggests it's specifically related to their data science study program.
*   **Purpose:** This page is likely a student's personal landing page, portfolio, or a simple placeholder indicating their identity within the IITM Data Science program, hosted on their GitHub Pages site. It might be used for showcasing assignments, projects, or as a contact point. The repeated display of the identifier/email suggests it's the primary piece of information this page aims to convey.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **URL:** `https://23f2004837.github.io`
*   **Page Content (Large Text):** `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Page Content (Normal Text):** `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Page Content (Hyperlink Text):** `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`*



html elements:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the **Google Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools)**, specifically the **"Elements" tab**. This tab is used to inspect the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage, showing the underlying HTML structure.

### Key Information:

1.  **Tool Context:** The user is interacting with the DevTools, likely for debugging, inspecting, or understanding the structure of a webpage. The active tab is "Elements," which provides a live view of the HTML and CSS of the current page. Other visible tabs include "Welcome" (likely the name of the current browser tab), "Console," "Sources," "Network," and "Performance."
2.  **HTML Structure:** The screenshot reveals the basic HTML structure of a very simple webpage:
    *   The root `<html>` element.
    *   A collapsed `<head>` element, indicated by `...` meaning its content is hidden but present.
    *   An expanded `<body>` element, which contains the visible content of the webpage.
3.  **Page Content:** Inside the `<body>`, there are three distinct pieces of content, all related to an email address:
    *   An `<h1>` (heading level 1) tag displaying the email address.
    *   A standalone text node (plain text) immediately following the `<h1>` tag, also displaying the email address. Note the leading and trailing spaces, enclosed in double quotes within the DevTools display.
    *   A `<p>` (paragraph) tag, which contains an `<a>` (anchor/link) tag.
        *   The `<a>` tag creates a "mailto" link, meaning clicking it would prompt the user to compose an email to the specified address.
        *   The `href` attribute correctly points to `mailto:23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
        *   The visible text of the link is also `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
4.  **DevTools Annotation:** The line `<p> == $0` indicates that the `<p>` element is currently selected or referenced in the DevTools console using the `$0` variable.

This screenshot suggests that a student in a data science course might be learning basic web development concepts, web scraping techniques, or how to inspect web elements for data extraction purposes. The repeated email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is the central piece of data being displayed and formatted in different ways.

### Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:

There are no error messages or explicit commands visible, but the HTML structure is displayed as follows:

```html
<html>
<head>...</head>
<body>
<h1>23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in</h1>
" 23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in "
<p>
<a href="mailto:23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in">23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in</a>
</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*(Note: The `== $0` next to `<p>` in the screenshot is a DevTools UI annotation, not part of the actual HTML code itself.)**



GA portal:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows a user interacting with a web application, likely for a data science course assignment or exam, which requires entering a GitHub Pages URL. Simultaneously, the Chrome DevTools are open to the "Sources" tab, revealing the underlying JavaScript code that processes this input.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Web Application Goal:** The user is prompted to provide a "GitHub Pages URL". An example format (`https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`) is provided.
2.  **User Input:** The user has entered `https://23f2004837.github.io/` into the URL input field.
3.  **Status:** The application is currently displaying "Checking..." below the input field, indicating that it's processing or validating the provided URL.
4.  **Cache Busting Advice:** A tip is given to add `?v=1` or `?v=2` to the URL if recent changes are not reflected, suggesting a potential caching issue for GitHub Pages.
5.  **Chrome DevTools - Sources Tab Active:**
    *   The "Sources" tab is selected, indicating the user or debugger is inspecting the application's source code.
    *   The "Console" tab has an orange warning icon, suggesting there might be errors or warnings logged there that are not visible in this screenshot.
6.  **File Navigation:** In the left pane of the Sources tab, a folder or project named `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2` is selected. Other files related to this project (`.info.js`, `.js`) are listed. A root `exam.sanand.workers.dev` is also visible.
7.  **Open Files:** Several JavaScript files are open as tabs: `exam.js` (currently active), `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js`, `fetch.js`, and `index.js`.
8.  **Debugging Context:** The debugger is paused on a specific line within `exam.js` (highlighted in yellow).
9.  **Code Logic - URL Validation:**
    *   A `try...catch` block is visible, suggesting an asynchronous operation (likely a network request or validation check) is being performed on the input URL.
    *   If the operation (`await $(f)`) fails, the `catch` block sets a variable `R` to the string "Incorrect. Try again.", which implies this message will be displayed to the user as feedback.
    *   The highlighted line `return d[e] = y ? r[e].weight : 0,` is being executed.
    *   The subsequent line `w.querySelector("invalid-feedback").textContent = R;` confirms that the value of `R` (which could be the error message) is used to update a feedback element on the page.
10. **Variable Values (Hover Information):** When hovering over variables in the code, their current values are displayed:
    *   `y = true`
    *   `$ = async a => {...}` (indicating `$` is an asynchronous function)
    *   `f = "https://23f2004837.github.io/"` (confirming that `f` holds the URL entered by the user, and this is the URL being processed by the `$(f)` function call).

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Prompt/Instruction Text:**
    `What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`
    `Checking...`
    `If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache.`

*   **User Input Field Content:**
    `https://23f2004837.github.io/`

*   **File Names in DevTools:**
    `exam.sanand.workers.dev`
    `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2`
    `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.info.js`
    `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js`
    `exam.js` (tab)
    `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js` (tab)
    `fetch.js` (tab)
    `index.js` (tab)

*   **JavaScript Code Snippet (`exam.js`):**
    ```javascript
    try {
        y = await $(f)
    } catch (_) {
        R = R = "Incorrect. Try again."
    }
    else {
        $ === null ? f && (y = !0) : y = f === $.toString();
    }
    return d[e] = y ? r[e].weight : 0,
    w.querySelector("invalid-feedback").textContent = R;
    ```

*   **Variable Values (from hover/scope):**
    `y = true`
    `$ = async a => {...}`
    `f = "https://23f2004837.github.io/"`*

I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the ‚Äúhttp‚Äù or ‚Äúhttps‚Äù prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.

This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‚ÄòE‚Äô, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.

In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

**Subject:** Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well.

I‚Äôm **Vicky Kumar**, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at **IIT Madras**. Over the last few months, I‚Äôve built a personal project called **‚ÄúVicky App‚Äù** ‚Äî a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like **TDS,**.

The system is capable of:

* Accurately solving over **90% of assignment-style questions** using regex and phonetic matching
* Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student‚Äôs input
* Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON
* Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM

You can test the platform here: <https://app.algsoch.tech>

---

### What‚Äôs in it for students:

* They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
* Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
* I‚Äôve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
* After that, students can access the full platform for just **‚Çπ199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs

---

### My Humble Request:

This is a tool I‚Äôve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.

To sustain the platform ‚Äî hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration ‚Äî I‚Äôve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.

I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

It‚Äôs built *by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students* ‚Äî with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.

Thank you so much for your time and support.

Warm regards,
