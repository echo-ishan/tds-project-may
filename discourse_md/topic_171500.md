Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.  
(roughly 3 days before end term).

Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

You were sent an email about it. With the peers to review. It came from the official TDS email.

You were sent an email on the 1st of April.

Kind regards

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?



> **Image:** The screenshot displays an email inbox, likely related to a data science course forum concerning peer reviews.  Two emails from user "22t1 se2002" are shown with the subject lines referencing "peer evaluations" and "peer allocations".  Both emails contain attachments named with a pattern of alphanumeric characters and the ".html" extension, for example, "23f3003944.html". Notably, "23f3003944.html" appears as an attachment in *both* email threads. The email subject also mentions deadlines and bonus points for completing the evaluations.
