Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.  
(roughly 3 days before end term).

Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can‚Äôt leave it blank.

You were sent an email about it. With the peers to review. It came from the official TDS email.

You were sent an email on the 1st of April.

Kind regards

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Gmail inbox focused on "peer review" activities within a data science course.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course Context:** The emails pertain to a "Data Science" (TDS) course for the "Jan 2025" batch.
2.  **Assignment Type:** The core activity is "peer evaluation" or "peer review" for "GA 7" (likely Graded Assignment 7).
3.  **Submission Requirement:** Students are required to "submit 3 peer evaluations" to be graded for their own assignment submission.
4.  **Bonus Opportunity:** There's a bonus of "5 Marks to T Score" for submitting these peer evaluations.
5.  **Assigned Evaluations:** The emails include `.html` attachments which are likely the specific peer evaluations assigned to the recipient for completion. The file `23f3003944.html` is highlighted twice, indicating it is a crucial, assigned evaluation.
6.  **Sender Information:**
    *   Emails regarding peer evaluation tasks and bonus opportunities are sent from `22t1 se2002`.
    *   A confirmation of submission for "GA 7 Review" is from `Google Forms 9`.
7.  **Timelines:** One email is from `Apr 1`, while another is a more recent `5:25 PM` (suggesting it's from the current day). This indicates an ongoing or recent activity related to the assignment.
8.  **User's Action:** The user is currently searching their Gmail for "peer review", suggesting they are actively looking for or managing these evaluations.
