> **Image:** The screenshot displays the results of prerequisite checks for a data science project. It indicates that the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repo exists and is public, and a Dockerfile is present in the root of the repo (all PASS). However, the check for an MIT license in the root of the GitHub repo has failed, resulting in an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status. This failure is preventing the Project 1 score from being assigned as it's currently set to "0". The instructions also describe the need to run the Docker image via the command `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a GitHub documentation page guiding users on how to add a license to a repository. Specifically, it instructs the user to type "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md" (all caps) in the file name field. A highlighted button "Choose a license template" is visible below the file name field. The UI shows a file creation interface within a GitHub repository, including the repository name "octo-repo" and a text input field for the license file name. Steps 5 and 6 instruct users to review available licenses under "Add a license to your project" and then to click Review and submit.



I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a GitHub commit history.  Several commits are displayed, including "Rename License.md to LICENSE.md", "Update License.md", "Update and rename README.md to License.md", and "project". Each commit lists the author as "virajpitale" and the respective date.  Next to each commit are elements like "Verified", the commit hash (e.g., "d62d2ee"), a copy icon, and a `<>` icon to view the commit.  The commits are grouped by date (Apr 3, 2025, Feb 17, 2025, Feb 15, 2025) which suggests a timeline view.



  
I submitted the project **within the deadline**, and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled**, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.
