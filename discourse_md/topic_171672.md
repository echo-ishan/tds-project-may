> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation message for "Project 1" in a data science course, detailing the prerequisites required for submission evaluation and the student's performance against them.

Here's the key information:

*   **Purpose of the Message:** To inform a learner about the pre-requisite checks for Project 1 and the outcome of those checks. Failure to meet these requirements means the submission will not be evaluated.
*   **Source of Details:** The message refers the learner to a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" for more details on the pre-requisite checks.
*   **List of 5 Pre-requisite Checks:**
    1.  Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    2.  Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    3.  Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
    4.  Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a specific `podman` command.
    5.  Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.
*   **Consequence of Failure:** "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."
*   **Prerequisite Evaluation Results:**
    *   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
    *   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
    *   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS
    *   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Overall Outcome:**
    *   **Prerequisites:** FAIL
    *   **Project 1 Score:** 0

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

**Command (from pre-requisite #4):**
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

**Evaluation Results (effectively "error messages" indicating failure points):**
*   `Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL`
*   `Prerequisites: FAIL`*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a GitHub Docs article providing instructions on how to add a license to a repository. It outlines a step-by-step process within the GitHub user interface.

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The document title is "Add a license to a repo" found under "GitHub Docs > Building communities > Healthy contributions."
*   **Goal:** The primary goal illustrated is to guide a user through adding a license file (e.g., `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`) to their GitHub repository, specifically using GitHub's built-in license templates.
*   **UI Elements Highlighted:**
    *   The `+` button in the repository file view, likely used to create a new file.
    *   An input field for the file name, shown with "LICENSE" typed into it.
    *   A button labeled "Choose a license template," which is emphasized with an orange outline.
*   **Process Steps:** The image details steps 3 through 6 of this process:
    *   Step 3 instructs the user to name the license file.
    *   Step 4 directs them to use the license template feature.
    *   Step 5 guides them to review and select a license from the available options.
    *   Step 6 is the final action to confirm and add the license.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no programming code blocks or error messages in the screenshot. The "commands" are user instructions within the UI:

*   **Instruction 3:** "In the file name field, type *LICENSE* or *LICENSE.md* (with all caps)."
*   **Instruction 4:** "Under the file name, click *Choose a license template*."
*   **UI Input (partial):** `LICENSE` (typed in the file name field after `octo-repo /`)
*   **UI Button:** `Choose a license template`
*   **Instruction 5:** "On the left side of the page, under "Add a license to your project," review the available licenses, then select a license from the list."
*   **Instruction 6:** "Click Review and submit."*



I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a Git commit history, likely from a GitHub repository, demonstrating the changes made over time to a project by a user. The interface is in a dark mode theme, typical of many development environments.

Here's a breakdown of the key information presented:

**General Overview:**
The image shows a chronological list of commits, grouped by date, from the most recent (top) to the oldest (bottom). Each commit entry includes a commit message, the author, the commit date, a verification status, a short commit hash, and icons to copy the hash or view the commit details. All visible commits were made by the user `virajpitale`.

**Detailed Commit Information (from newest to oldest):**

1.  **Commits on Apr 3, 2025**
    *   **Commit Message:** `Rename License.md to LICENSE.md`
    *   **Author & Timestamp:** `virajpitale authored 4 days ago` (This indicates the screenshot was taken around April 7, 2025)
    *   **Status:** `Verified` (Indicates the commit was cryptographically signed and verified)
    *   **Commit Hash:** `d62d2ee`
    *   **Observation:** This commit specifically addresses a change in capitalization for the license file, correcting `License.md` to `LICENSE.md`, which is a common practice for standard top-level files.

2.  **Commits on Feb 17, 2025**
    *   **Commit Message:** `Update License.md`
    *   **Author & Timestamp:** `virajpitale authored on Feb 17`
    *   **Status:** `Verified`
    *   **Commit Hash:** `762400b`
    *   **Observation:** This commit indicates a modification to the content of the `License.md` file.

3.  **Commits on Feb 15, 2025**
    *   **Commit 1 (Top entry for this date):**
        *   **Commit Message:** `Update and rename README.md to License.md`
        *   **Author & Timestamp:** `virajpitale authored on Feb 15`
        *   **Status:** `Verified`
        *   **Commit Hash:** `26f75aa`
        *   **Observation:** This is a significant commit where the `README.md` file was not only updated but also renamed to `License.md`. This suggests an initial decision to convert the project's primary introductory document into a license file.
    *   **Commit 2 (Bottom entry for this date):**
        *   **Commit Message:** `project`
        *   **Author & Timestamp:** `virajpitale committed on Feb 15`
        *   **Status:** (No "Verified" badge present, unlike the others)
        *   **Commit Hash:** `c94aac6`
        *   **Observation:** This is likely the initial commit for the repository, denoted by the generic message `project`. The absence of a "Verified" badge might imply it was committed before signing was configured or from a different Git client.

**Transcribed Text/Code:**

*   **Commit Messages:**
    *   `Rename License.md to LICENSE.md`
    *   `Update License.md`
    *   `Update and rename README.md to License.md`
    *   `project`
*   **Commit Hashes (Short SHAs):**
    *   `d62d2ee`
    *   `762400b`
    *   `26f75aa`
    *   `c94aac6`
*   **Other Text:**
    *   `Commits on Apr 3, 2025`
    *   `virajpitale authored 4 days ago`
    *   `Verified` (repeated)
    *   `Commits on Feb 17, 2025`
    *   `virajpitale authored on Feb 17`
    *   `Commits on Feb 15, 2025`
    *   `virajpitale authored on Feb 15`
    *   `virajpitale committed on Feb 15`*



  
I submitted the project **within the deadline**, and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled**, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.
