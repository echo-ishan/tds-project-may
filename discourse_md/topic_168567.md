Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this.

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right?  
Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it done.  
Thoughts?

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.
