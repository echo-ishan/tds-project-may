# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

### Why?

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU ü´µüèΩ

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

* If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
* If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful

### Where?

[github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank/blob/main/README.md)

#### [README.md](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank/blob/main/README.md)

[`main`](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank/blob/main/README.md)

```
# TDS-Project2-QuestionBank
Question Bank for all TDS assignments

# Requested format
## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1.py     # Solution in Python
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment_2/

```
