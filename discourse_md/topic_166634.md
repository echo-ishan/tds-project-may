Sir I am having trouble in q8 also whenever I am pushing commit in git hub it was showing in GitHub repository but it is not working in git hub actions.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the GitHub Actions tab for a repository, likely encountered by a student or user in a data science course working with CI/CD pipelines or automated tasks. The user appears to be troubleshooting recurring failures in their GitHub workflow.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Context:**
*   The user is viewing the GitHub Actions page of a repository named `my-repo` owned by `Sakshi6749`.
*   The URL confirms this: `github.com/Sakshi6749/my-repo/actions`.
*   The interface is in a dark theme.
*   The current time on the user's system is 23:41 on February 9, 2025.

**GitHub Actions Interface Elements:**
*   The `Actions` tab is currently selected in the repository's navigation bar.
*   The left sidebar shows `All workflows` is selected, with a single listed workflow named `Daily Commit`.
*   Below the workflows, there are sections for `Management` including `Caches`, `Attestations`, `Runners`, `Usage metrics`, and `Performance metrics`.
*   A `New workflow` button is visible for creating new GitHub Actions.
*   There's a search bar to `Filter workflow runs`.
*   Workflow runs are displayed with columns for `Event`, `Status`, `Branch`, and `Actor`.

**Key Observation - Workflow Failures:**
The most critical information is that **all three recent workflow runs shown have failed**, indicated by a red 'X' icon next to their names. This suggests a persistent issue with the `Daily Commit` workflow.

**Detailed Breakdown of Workflow Runs:**

1.  **Workflow Run 1 (Topmost):**
    *   **Name:** `second time`
    *   **Status:** Failed (Red X)
    *   **Description:** `Daily Commit #3: Commit 7715436 pushed by Sakshi6749`
    *   **Branch:** `main`
    *   **Time:** `33 minutes ago`
    *   **Duration:** `10s`
    *   **Trigger:** Pushed a commit (`7715436`).

2.  **Workflow Run 2 (Middle):**
    *   **Name:** `Daily Commit`
    *   **Status:** Failed (Red X)
    *   **Description:** `Daily Commit #2: Manually run by Sakshi6749`
    *   **Branch:** `main`
    *   **Time:** `4 hours ago`
    *   **Duration:** `10s`
    *   **Trigger:** Manually run.

3.  **Workflow Run 3 (Bottom):**
    *   **Name:** `Daily Commit`
    *   **Status:** Failed (Red X)
    *   **Description:** `Daily Commit #1: Manually run by Sakshi6749`
    *   **Branch:** `main`
    *   **Time:** `4 hours ago`
    *   **Duration:** `11s`
    *   **Trigger:** Manually run.

**Exact Transcriptions:**

*   **URL:** `github.com/Sakshi6749/my-repo/actions`
*   **Repository Navigation:** `Code`, `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Actions`, `Projects`, `Wiki`, `Security`, `Insights`, `Settings`
*   **Left Sidebar (Actions):**
    *   `Actions` (header)
    *   `All workflows`
    *   `Daily Commit` (workflow name)
    *   `Management` (header)
    *   `Caches`
    *   `Attestations`
    *   `Runners`
    *   `Usage metrics`
    *   `Performance metrics`
*   **Main Content Area Headers:**
    *   `All workflows`
    *   `Showing runs from all workflows`
    *   `3 workflow runs`
    *   `Event`
    *   `Status`
    *   `Branch`
    *   `Actor`
*   **Button Text:** `New workflow`
*   **Search Bar Placeholder:** `Filter workflow runs`
*   **Workflow Run Names:**
    *   `second time`
    *   `Daily Commit`
*   **Workflow Run Descriptions:**

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository page, likely belonging to a student or participant in a data science course, demonstrating their version control setup.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Details:**
*   **Owner:** Sakshi6749
*   **Repository Name:** `my-repo`
*   **URL:** `github.com/Sakshi6749/my-repo`
*   **Visibility:** Public

**2. Repository Navigation:**
The user is currently viewing the `Code` tab. Other available tabs include `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Actions`, `Projects`, `Wiki`, `Security`, `Insights`, and `Settings`.

**3. Repository Overview/Stats:**
*   **Branch:** `main` (selected)
*   **Stars:** 0
*   **Watching:** 1
*   **Forks:** 0
*   **About Section:** "No description, website, or topics provided."
*   **README:** A `README.md` file is present.

**4. Latest Commit Information (on `main` branch):**
*   **Commit Author:** Sakshi6749
*   **Commit Message:** `third time` (This is the most recent commit on the main branch.)
*   **Commit Hash (partial):** `c7a8ea2`
*   **Commit Time:** 31 minutes ago
*   **Total Commits:** 5 Commits

**5. Files and Directories in the Repository Root:**
*   **Folder:** `.github/workflows` (last committed 31 minutes ago with message "third time")
*   **File:** `README.md` (last committed 5 hours ago with message "changes done")

**6. Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**
*   **README.md Content (preview):**
    ```
    # Demo
    ```
    (Note: This is the only visible content that could be considered 'code' or structured text from a file.)

**7. Other Noteworthy Information:**
*   The system is a Windows 11 machine, evident from the taskbar icons and design.
*   The laptop brand is an "ASUS Zenbook".
*   The current local time is 09:12.
*   The weather is 14°C Haze.

**Contextual Inference (for a data science course):**
This screenshot likely shows a student's initial steps in using Git and GitHub for version control. The commit messages like "changes done" and "third time" suggest iterative work, possibly indicating they are learning to commit, push, and manage their repository for a project, perhaps following instructions to create a README or add specific workflow files. The `.github/workflows` directory suggests the potential future use of GitHub Actions for automation (e.g., CI/CD for data pipelines, model training, or deployment).*



  
It is working in repo
