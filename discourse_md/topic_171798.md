Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?

This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?

Yes, you can.  
More details given in student handbook. Search for repeat courses.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows documentation regarding repeating courses for improvement. The documentation states that students can repeat courses with grades A, B, C, D, or E to improve their grade, with the highest grade recorded on the transcript. "Course fee Repeat for Improvement courses will be double the normal fee." The total number of courses must be within the "CCC limit." The documentation recommends progressing with new courses instead of repeating.

TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.

Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. **We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.** If you have passed it, its better to move on.

Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective).

So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.

This is not up to us. We make adjustments within assignments and projects and we have done that already. For course level bonuses, that is the discretion of operations.
