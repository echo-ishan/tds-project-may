Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a structured dataset, likely metadata for economic time series data, specifically related to Producer Price Index (PPI) within the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The data is presented in a spreadsheet format (similar to Excel or Google Sheets), with attributes in Column A and their corresponding values in Column B.

There are two distinct data series described:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Data Type:** The data represents metadata for "PPI industry data" series.
2.  **Structure:** Each series is described by a set of common attributes:
    *   `Series Title`: A comprehensive description of the data series.
    *   `Series ID`: A unique alphanumeric identifier for the series.
    *   `Seasonality`: Indicates whether the data has been adjusted for seasonal variations.
    *   `Survey Name`: The overarching survey or data collection effort.
    *   `Measure Data Ty` (likely "Type"): The specific type of data or item being measured.
    *   `Industry`: The broader industry category.
    *   `Item`: The specific product or preparation within the industry.
3.  **Common Attributes Across Both Series:**
    *   `Seasonality`: "Not Seasonally Adjusted" for both.
    *   `Survey Name`: "PPI Industry Data" for both.
    *   `Industry`: "Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing" for both.
4.  **Distinguishing Attributes:** The two series are differentiated primarily by the specific "Measure Data Type" / "Item" they represent and their unique `Series ID`.

**Transcribed Information (Data Values):**

**Series 1 (Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations):**

*   **Cell A1 (Description header):** PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted
*   **Series Title:** PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted
*   **Series ID:** PCU3254123254127111
*   **Seasonality:** Not Seasonally Adjusted
*   **Survey Name:** PPI Industry Data
*   **Measure Data Ty:** Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations
*   **Industry:** Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing
*   **Item:** Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations

--- (Separator Line) ---

**Series 2 (Calcium channel blockers):**

*   **Cell A11 (Description header):** PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not seasonally adjusted
*   **Series Title:** PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not seasonally adjusted
*   **Series ID:** PCU3254123254127114
*   **Seasonality:** Not Seasonally Adjusted
*   **Survey Name:** PPI Industry Data
*   **Measure Data Ty:** Calcium channel blockers
*   **Industry:** Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing
*   **Item:** Calcium channel blockers*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a data science assignment or question (labeled "Question 7.1") from an online course, likely involving data analysis using Google Sheets.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Context:**
The assignment requires students to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical exports on India's economy for a new political party called "Buddhi Daya Nyaay (BDN)". A specific figure for FY 2024 exports to the US (₹ 2,42,888 Crores) is provided as background. The goal is to create an "insightful analysis" using provided CSV files.

**Provided Data Files (likely downloadable CSVs):**
1.  **Industry Product Segment Information**
2.  **Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)**

**Tasks:**

1.  **Google Sheet Creation:**
    *   Create a **new blank Google Sheet workbook**.
    *   Name it exactly: `ga.7.1.rollno` (where `rollno` must be replaced with the student's IITM roll number, excluding the domain).

2.  **Sharing Instructions (CRITICAL):**
    *   Share the workbook with **editing rights** to the email address: `se2002@study.iitm.ac.in`.
    *   **Important Warning:** This sharing step *must* be done first, on a **blank workbook**. Failure to do so will result in the submission not being considered.

3.  **Sheet Naming Convention (CRITICAL):**
    *   Students must ensure sheet names within the Google Sheet are **exactly** as specified.

4.  **Sheet1 Structure:**
    *   The first sheet, named **Sheet1**, must contain the following columns: `Series ID`, `Item`, `Year`, `Month`, and `Value`. (This implies importing or organizing data into this structure).

5.  **Sheet2 Structure (Pivot Table):**
    *   The second sheet, named **Sheet2**, must contain a **pivot table**.
    *   **Pivot Table Configuration:**
        *   `Item` as rows.
        *   `Year` and `Month` as columns, following a hierarchical stack.
        *   `Value` as the values.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are no direct code blocks, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The instructions are descriptive steps for performing tasks within a Google Sheet environment.*



Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

@[Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/Jivraj)

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a clear specification regarding the structure of a data source, likely a spreadsheet or a table, which is common in data science exercises or real-world data preparation.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Data Source Reference:** The entry is numbered "4.", suggesting it's part of a sequence of instructions or data descriptions.
2.  **Sheet/Table Name:** The data being described is specifically located on "Sheet1". This is crucial for data loading steps (e.g., using `pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')` in pandas).
3.  **Column Definitions:** It explicitly lists the expected column headers within "Sheet1". This information is fundamental for understanding the dataset's structure, accessing specific data points, and preparing for analysis.
    *   **Series ID:** Likely a unique identifier for different data series or groups.
    *   **Item:** A categorical variable describing the specific item or category being measured.
    *   **Year:** A temporal column indicating the year of the data observation.
    *   **Month:** Another temporal column, likely indicating the month within the specified year. Together with 'Year', these suggest time-series data.
    *   **Value:** The quantitative variable representing the actual measurement or data point for a given Series ID, Item, Year, and Month.

This information is essential for anyone attempting to load, process, or analyze this particular dataset, as it provides the schema.

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  


> **Image Content:** *The screenshot displays a snippet of tabular data, likely from a spreadsheet or a data science environment like a Pandas DataFrame. It represents time-series data, specifically monthly observations for a given series.

**Key Information:**

*   **Structure:** The data is organized into rows and columns with distinct headers.
*   **Column Headers:**
    *   `Series ID`
    *   `Year`
    *   `Period`
    *   `Label`
    *   `Value`
*   **Data Rows (Transcribed Exactly):**
    *   **Row 1:**
        *   `Series ID`: `PCU3254–3254–` (Note: The end of the ID is truncated, but this is what's visible).
        *   `Year`: `2023`
        *   `Period`: `M01`
        *   `Label`: `2023 Jan`
        *   `Value`: `562.445`
    *   **Row 2:** (Partially visible)
        *   `Series ID`: `PCU3254–3254–` (Matches the first row, suggesting it's for the same series).
        *   `Year`: `2023`
        *   `Period`: `M02`
        *   `Label`: `2023 Feb`
        *   `Value`: `565.048`

**Analysis in Data Science Context:**

*   This data is formatted for easy ingestion into tools like Pandas DataFrames.
*   The `Series ID` likely serves as a primary key or identifier for different time series.
*   `Year`, `Period` (monthly code, M01, M02, etc.), and `Label` (human-readable date) provide temporal context.
*   `Value` represents the measured quantity for each specific time point and series.
*   A user might be preparing to load this data for time-series analysis, such as plotting trends, forecasting, or calculating statistics over time.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
No code, commands, or error messages are visible in this screenshot. It only shows data.*

Below items don’t have prices.

| PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations |
| --- | --- |
| PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers |
| PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts |
| PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter |
| PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids |
| PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products |
| PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors |

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

> [Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrkZgDnx7uYjOxFW2XDrA5F0xFre_PCS/view?usp=drive_link)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a data table, likely from a spreadsheet application such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, showing aggregated data, possibly a pivot table. It appears to be an analysis of the "SUM of Value" for various "Items" (categories of products or medications) over time, specifically for the year 2023, broken down by month.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Table Structure:**
    *   **Row 1 (A1):** "SUM of Value" indicates that the values in the table represent the sum of some underlying metric.
    *   **Column A (Header):** "Item" lists various categories.
    *   **Columns B-H (Headers):** The columns are organized hierarchically:
        *   "Year" (Column B) with "2023" nested under it.
        *   "Month" (Column C onward) with "Total" and then specific months like "M01", "M02", "M03", "M04", "M05" (likely representing January, February, etc.) nested under "2023".

2.  **Data Content:**
    *   **Items:** A long list of pharmaceutical or health-related item categories is visible, including:
        *   ACE inhibitors (A4)
        *   Analgesics (A5)
        *   Analgesics, over-the-counter (A6)
        *   Analgesics, prescription (A7)
        *   Antacids (A8)
        *   Anti-acne preparations (A9)
        *   Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations (A10)
        *   Anticonvulsants (A11)
        *   Antidepressants (A12)
        *   Antihistamines and bronchodilators, including antiasthmatics (A13)
        *   Broad and medium spectrum antibiotics (A14)
        *   Calcium channel blockers (A15)
        *   Cancer therapy products (A16)
        *   Hormones and oral contraceptives (A17)
        *   Insulin/antidiabetes products (A18)
        *   Miscellaneous receipts (A19)
        *   Multivitamins (A20)
        *   Other cardiovascular preparations (A21)
        *   Other central nervous system and sense organs (A22)
        *   Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations (A23)
        *   Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter (A24)
        *   Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, prescription (A25)
        *   Other neoplasms, endocrine system, and metabolic diseases (A26)
        *   Other parasitic and infective diseases (A27)
        *   Other pharmaceutical preparations acting on the skin (A28)
    *   **Values:** The cells contain numerical values representing the "SUM of Value" for each item per month. For example, "ACE inhibitors" (Row 4) show values like 337.36 (M01), 351.575 (M02), etc.

3.  **Highlighted Discrepancy/Problem:**
    *   The red arrows draw attention to a clear inconsistency:
        *   For "ACE inhibitors" (Row 4), the "Total" column (C4) shows **0**, yet the individual monthly values (D4-G4 and beyond) are clearly positive (e.g., 337.36, 351.575).
        *   Similarly, for "Antacids" (Row 8), the "Total" column (C8) shows **0**, but the monthly values (D8-G8 and beyond) are positive (e.g., 106.13).
        *   This pattern repeats for several other items (e.g., "Anti-acne preparations" in Row 9 also shows 0 in Total but positive monthly values).
    *   This indicates an issue where the overall "Total" for the months within 2023 is not correctly summing the individual monthly values for these specific "Items".

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Cell A4 (Formula bar):** `ACE inhibitors` (This is the literal text content of cell A4, not a formula or command).
*   There are **no visible error messages, code, or commands** displayed in the screenshot. The issue appears to be a data calculation or display problem within the spreadsheet itself, rather than an explicit error message.*

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
