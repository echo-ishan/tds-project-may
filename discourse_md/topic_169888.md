Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows data organized in a spreadsheet, likely from a data science project involving PPI (Producer Price Index) data analysis. Two distinct data series related to "Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing" are displayed, one for "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations," and the other for "Calcium channel blockers." Key fields include "Series Title," "Series ID" (PCU3254123254127111 and PCU3254123254127114 respectively), "Seasonality" (Not Seasonally Adjusted), "Survey Name" (PPI Industry Data), "Measure Data Type," "Industry," and "Item." There is no code or error message visible, but the data's structure suggests a potential cleaning or analysis task related to these specific pharmaceutical preparations.

> **Image:** The screenshot outlines a data analysis task for a data science course, focusing on the impact of Indian pharmaceutical exports to the US. Students are instructed to use two provided CSV files ("Industry Product Segment Information" and "Monthly Price Indices for Segments") in a Google Sheet. The task requires creating a Google Sheet named "ga.7.1.rollno" (replacing "rollno" with their IITM roll number), sharing editing rights with "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in," and creating two sheets within the workbook. "Sheet1" should contain columns named "Series ID," "Item," "Year," "Month," and "Value," while "Sheet2" should be a pivot table with "Item" as rows, "Year" and "Month" as columns with stacked hierarchies, and "Value" as the value field.



Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  


> **Image:** The screenshot provides context about the structure of data in a spreadsheet. The text "Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value" indicates that a sheet named "Sheet1" in a spreadsheet or a data frame contains columns named "Series ID", "Item", "Year", "Month", and "Value". This implies the data is likely time-series data associated with different items identified by their IDs. No code, errors, UI elements, or visualizations are present in the image. The information describes the schema of a dataset, likely for a data analysis task.



but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  


> **Image:** The screenshot shows a table with time series data. Columns include "Series ID", "Year", "Period", "Label", and "Value." Specific entries include data from the year 2023, periods "M01" and "M02," and labels "2023 Jan" and "2023 Feb". The "Value" column contains numerical data like 562.445 and 565.040. No error messages are visible.

Below items don’t have prices.

| PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations |
| --- | --- |
| PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers |
| PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts |
| PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter |
| PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids |
| PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products |
| PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors |

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

> [Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrkZgDnx7uYjOxFW2XDrA5F0xFre_PCS/view?usp=drive_link)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?  



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a data table in a spreadsheet program, possibly Google Sheets or Excel, titled "SUM of Value". The table includes "Item" categories (e.g., "ACE inhibitors", "Antacids"), "Year", "Month", and "Total" columns. The years are summarized to 0 for the "Total" month category and there is a column for each month of "2023" with numeric values for each of the "Items". Some of the year/month totals are populated (from M01-M05), while others appear empty. The user might be investigating why the total amounts for "Year" categories are showing "0" when the monthly values for "2023" are populated for at least some categories like "ACE inhibitors".

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Can you please advise regarding the ga.7.2 as the The current top 5 countries by GDP in 2014 from the dataset are actually aggregated economic groups (not individual countries). can i proceed with that or I need to filter only the individual countries

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Gmail inbox related to a data science course, specifically regarding "peer review" assignments. The subject lines mention "[TDS Jan 25] BONUS 5 Marks to T Score" and "GA 7 Peer allocations" requiring the submission of 3 peer evaluations for grading.  HTML files (e.g., "23f3003944.html", "23f1001126.html") are attached to these emails, likely containing the peer evaluations. The user appears to have received the same file "23f3003944.html" twice, possibly indicating an issue with the allocation or submission process. The email dates are January 25th and April 1st, suggesting a potential timeline for the peer review process.

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
