Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a view of an online examination or assignment platform for a data science course, likely from IIT Madras, given the domain and email addresses. The platform appears to be for "Graded Assignment 3" for "TDS 2025 Jan" (The Data Science program, January 2025 intake).

**Key Information:**

1.  **Assignment Status & Deadline:**
    *   The assignment is titled "Graded Assignment 3 :: IITM O" (likely IIT Madras Online).
    *   The header clearly states: "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This indicates the submission deadline has passed.
    *   The system time visible in the taskbar confirms the current date is "07-02-2025" (February 7, 2025), which is indeed past the deadline.

2.  **Scoring Information (Discrepancy Noted):**
    *   The main banner shows "Score: 0".
    *   However, the "Recent saves" section indicates previous attempts/saves with a consistent "Score: 8". Specifically:
        *   "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:41 PM. Score: 8"
        *   "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:37 PM. Score: 8"
        *   "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:32 PM. Score: 8"
    *   This discrepancy suggests either "Score: 0" is the final submitted score, or the score for the current state of the quiz, while "Score: 8" refers to partial completion or scores on specific questions saved during the attempt. All saves were made before the deadline.

3.  **User Identity:**
    *   The user is logged in as `23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email matches the one seen in an open browser tab.

4.  **Exam/Quiz Policies (Highly Permissive and Unique):**
    *   **Open Resource Policy:** "Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want." This indicates a highly open-book, open-internet exam format.
    *   **"Hackable" Design (Crucial):** "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed." This is a remarkable and unique policy, suggesting the assignment aims to test practical, real-world problem-solving, debugging, and potentially security-related skills rather than just theoretical knowledge.
    *   **Technical Environment Requirement:** "You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers." This implies a complex local setup is required from the student, potentially involving Docker containers or other local server instances, adding to the technical challenge.
    *   **Browser Compatibility:** "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser." - A warning about potential technical difficulties with the platform.

5.  **Platform Details:**
    *   **URL:** The assignment is hosted at `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3`. The `workers.dev` domain suggests the platform might be built using Cloudflare Workers.
    *   **Support:** A link is provided to "Join the discussion on Discourse" for questions, indicating a dedicated forum for course support.

6.  **Partial Content:**
    *   Below the "Recent saves" section, the header "Questions" is visible, indicating the actual questions for the assignment would follow.

**Transcribed Information (Code, Commands, or Error Messages - Exact Appearance):**

There are no explicit code blocks, commands, or error messages displayed in the screenshot. However, the following key phrases and identifiers are transcribed exactly as they appear:

*   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3`
*   **Login Email:** `23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Instructions Text:**
    *   `5. Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.`
    *   `6. Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.`
    *   `7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.`
    *   `Note: You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers.`
*   **Discussion Link:** `Join the discussion on Discourse`
*   **Recent Save Entries:**
    *   `Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:41 PM. Score: 8`
    *   `Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:37 PM. Score: 8`
    *   `Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:32 PM. Score: 8`*

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that i have not submitted the assignment.

Can you please look into it as i had saved my answers as well timely.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays a "Recent saves" feature, likely from an online integrated development environment (IDE), a coding playground, or a module within a data science course platform. It serves as a history or version control mechanism, allowing users to manage different states of their work.

1.  **Purpose:** The primary purpose of this section is to provide a list of recent progress saves, enabling the user to revert to or review past versions of their work.
2.  **Save Details:** Each entry represents a distinct save point and includes:
    *   **Timestamp:** The exact date and time the save was made. All shown saves are from "2/2/2025" and occur within a very short timeframe around "9:04 PM", specifically at 9:04:58 PM, 9:04:53 PM, and 9:04:51 PM. This suggests either frequent manual saving or an aggressive auto-save mechanism.
    *   **Score:** Each save is associated with a "Score: 4". This likely indicates the score achieved for the specific exercise, task, or notebook at the time of that save. The consistent score of 4 across all these saves could mean the user had already achieved the maximum score or a stable score and was perhaps making minor adjustments or exploring variations.
3.  **Functionality:** The presence of a "Reload" button next to each save indicates that the user can load any of these previous states, effectively reverting their current workspace to that saved point.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no typical code blocks or error messages visible. The interactive elements and their associated text are transcribed below:

**Header:**
Recent saves

**List Items:**
1.  Reload from 2/2/2025, 9:04:58 PM. Score: 4
2.  Reload from 2/2/2025, 9:04:53 PM. Score: 4
3.  Reload from 2/2/2025, 9:04:51 PM. Score: 4*

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online examination or quiz interface for a data science course, characterized by a dark theme and comprehensive instructions.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

*   **3. Save regularly by pressing Save.** You can save multiple times. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.
*   **4. Reloading is OK.** Your answers are saved in your browser (not server). Questions won't change except for randomized parameters.
*   **5. Browser may struggle.** If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.
*   **6. Use anything.** You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.
*   **7. It's hackable.** It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.

**3. Important Note:**

**4. Support/Community:**
*   **Question Prompt:** Have questions?
*   **Forum Link:** Join the discussion on Discourse

**5. User Information:**
*   **Logged In User:** You are logged in as 23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.
*   **Logout Button:** A red button labeled "Logout".

**6. Recent Saves History:**
This section displays past submission attempts and their scores, with the most recent being the official score.
*   **Section Title:** Recent saves (most recent is your official score)
*   **Save Entries (from most to least recent):**
    *   Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:19 PM. Score: 6
    *   Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:07 PM. Score: 6
    *   Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:00:34 PM. Score: 4.5

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are no explicit code snippets or error messages visible in the screenshot. The "commands" are strictly button labels and links:
*   `Check all` (button label)
*   `Save` (button label)
*   `Check` (within instruction text, referring to a button)
*   `Save` (within instruction text, referring to a button)
*   `Discourse` (link text)

*   `Reload` (link text, appearing multiple times in the "Recent saves" section)*



  
and the same happened for the 3rd assignment

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards
