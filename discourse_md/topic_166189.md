Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Kind regards

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a submission page for a graded assignment named "TDS 2025 Jan GA3". It indicates the assignment ended on "Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and the current score is 0.  The page displays a "Recent saves" section, listing three attempts on 2/1/2025 with timestamps and a score of 8 each. Instructions mention potential browser issues, permitted use of external resources including hacking, and a note about running multiple servers. There are buttons to "Check all", "Save" and "Reload".

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that i have not submitted the assignment.

Can you please look into it as i had saved my answers as well timely.  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a UI element labeled "Recent saves," listing three saved states. Each save includes a "Reload" button and the associated timestamp on 2/2/2025, with the last save being at "9:04:58 PM", "9:04:53 PM", and "9:04:51 PM" respectively. Each save also has a "Score: 4". The user can likely click the "Reload" buttons to revert to a specific point in their session. No code snippets or error messages are visible in the provided image.

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.  



> **Image:** The screenshot is from a data science course quiz interface. The interface shows the quiz's end time "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and current score "Score: 0," with buttons "Check all" and "Save".  Several informational points are displayed about using resources, saving answers, and addressing browser issues.  "Recent saves" are listed along with reload buttons, dates, and scores (e.g., "Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:19 PM. Score: 6").  The user is logged in as "23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.".



  
and the same happened for the 3rd assignment

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards
