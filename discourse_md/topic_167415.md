I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like

* Is the GitHub repo public?
* Does it have an MIT license?
* Does it have a DockerFile?
* Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

**Reactions:** 👍 1

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays critical feedback or error messages likely from an automated submission system for a data science course or competition. It outlines prerequisites that must be met for a submission to be evaluated.

### Key Information:

1.  **Submission Checklist Failures:** The first line lists three specific items that are missing or incorrectly configured in the submitted project:
    *   **Repository Issue:** "No such repo" indicates that the system could not find or access the specified repository (likely a Git repository like GitHub or GitLab). This could be due to an incorrect link, a private repository without proper access, or the repository simply not existing.
    *   **Licensing Requirement:** "No "MIT" in LICENSE" means the submission lacks a license file, or the existing license file does not contain the "MIT" string, implying that an MIT license is required for the project. This is common for open-source projects or academic submissions to define usage rights.
    *   **Containerization Requirement:** "No Dockerfile" signifies that a `Dockerfile` is missing from the submission. A Dockerfile is essential for building a Docker image, which would contain the project's environment, dependencies, and code, ensuring reproducibility and ease of deployment/grading.
2.  **Scoring Prerequisite:** The second line clearly states that passing this "checklist" is a mandatory condition for the submission to be "even considered for scoring." This implies a strict gating process, where foundational requirements must be met before any actual code or model performance is evaluated.

### Transcription:

No such repo;No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile

Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring.*

  
Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.  
I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Warm Regards,

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a directory listing, most likely from a Git repository viewer (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), showing the project's file structure, the last commit message for each entry, and its last modification timestamp. It provides a snapshot of the project's recent development activity.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Project Structure:** The project is organized into several top-level directories and files:
    *   `Business` (folder)
    *   `Operations` (folder)
    *   `app` (folder)
    *   `Dockerfile` (file)
    *   `LICENSE` (file)
    *   `README.md` (file)

2.  **Recent Activity & Commit Messages:**

    *   **`Dockerfile` (file):**
        *   **Last Modified:** yesterday
        *   **Commit Message:** `Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile`
        *   **Analysis:** This indicates a recent change to the casing of the `Dockerfile` name, likely to adhere to standard conventions where Docker expects `Dockerfile` (capital D) by default. This suggests active development related to containerization.

    *   **`app` (folder):**
        *   **Last Modified:** 2 days ago
        *   **Commit Message:** `Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt`
        *   **Analysis:** This is a critical update. It implies the `app` directory contains the main application code. The update of `Dockerfile` (likely the one *inside* the `app` directory, or it refers to the top-level one if the commit message is generic) and `requirements.txt` strongly indicates a Python-based application that is being prepared or maintained for Docker containerization. `requirements.txt` lists Python dependencies, and `Dockerfile` defines how to build a Docker image for the application.

    *   **`Business` (folder):**
        *   **Last Modified:** 2 days ago
        *   **Commit Message:** `Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10`
        *   **Analysis:** This folder seems to contain components or scripts related to business-specific tasks. The commit message suggests these tasks (`taskB8`, `taskB9`, `taskB10`) were reconfigured or updated recently.

    *   **`Operations` (folder):**
        *   **Last Modified:** 2 days ago
        *   **Commit Message:** `Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10`
        *   **Analysis:** Similar to the `Business` folder, this folder likely holds operational components. Tasks `taskA8`, `taskA9`, `taskA10` were also reconfigured, possibly in conjunction with the business tasks given the same timestamp.

    *   **`LICENSE` (file):**
        *   **Last Modified:** 3 days ago
        *   **Commit Message:** `MIT License`
        *   **Analysis:** Indicates the project is open-source under the MIT License. This was set up early in the project's recent history.

    *   **`README.md` (file):**
        *   **Last Modified:** 3 days ago
        *   **Commit Message:** `Project Structure`
        *   **Analysis:** This is a standard markdown file providing an overview of the project. The commit message suggests it describes the organization of the repository itself. This file was also set up early.

3.  **Inferred Technologies/Practices:**
    *   **Docker:** Heavily implied by the presence and recent updates to `Dockerfile`.
    *   **Python:** Strongly suggested by the mention of `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Version Control (Git):** The interface clearly shows commit messages and history, typical of a Git repository.
    *   **Modular Design:** The separation into `Business`, `Operations`, and `app` directories suggests a well-structured project with distinct concerns.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code blocks, commands, or error messages in this screenshot. The "commands" column contains descriptive commit messages, not executable commands.

**Exact Transcriptions of Commit Messages:**

*   `Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10`
*   `Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10`
*   `Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt`
*   `Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile`
*   `MIT License`
*   `Project Structure`*
