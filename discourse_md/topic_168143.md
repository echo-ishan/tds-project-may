my score from week 2 to week 5 are still showing not submitted.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a course progress interface for a data science course. Module 2 ("Deployment Tools") is expanded, showing "Graded Assignment 2" which is "Not Submitted" and due on "2 Feb 2025". Score columns including "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score" are visible, all currently showing a dash ("-") likely signifying missing data due to the assignment not being submitted. Other modules, such as "Module 3: Large Language Models", "Module 4: Data Sourcing", and "Module 5: Data Preparation" are collapsed. The UI uses dropdown menus to reveal or hide course module content.

[@23f1000879](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1000879) This is not the screen where you see your scores for Tools in Data Science. Its only shown on dashboard. Can you send a screenshot of your dashboard. Thanks

Kind regards
