[@Divya1](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/divya1) there are no IITM certified books nor PDFs for [Tools in Data Science](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34). The site <https://tds.s-anand.net/> is the reference.

We update the content regularly. You might want to [track the changes](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commits/tds-2025-01/) for recent updates.
