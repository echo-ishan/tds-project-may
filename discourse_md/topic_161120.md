The user is prompted to input their Vercel URL, with an example provided as "https://your-app.vercel.app/api".  The input field contains "https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api", suggesting an attempt to connect to a specific app instance.

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.

Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python FastAPI application and its execution in a terminal. The `main.py` file defines an API endpoint `/api` that takes an optional list of classes as a query parameter. The code reads student data from a CSV file and filters students based on the provided class(es). The terminal output shows the Uvicorn server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. There's a "404 Not Found" error for a request to `/`, but subsequent "GET /api" and "GET /api?class=1A" requests return a "200 OK" status, indicating the API is accessible.

The error further specifies `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused`, suggesting that the service on localhost is not running or is not accessible.  UI elements show a flow from "Internet" to "ngrok Edge" to "ngrok Agent" where the connection fails before reaching "Your Service".

Hi Mishkat,

Please use triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.

eg

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

```

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Docker Desktop error related to WSL. The error message indicates an unexpected problem occurred during WSL command execution, specifically while "importing WSL distro 'WSL2 is not supported with'". The UI displays suggested solutions: shutting down WSL using `wsl --shutdown` or rebooting the machine. There are also options to gather diagnostics and quit the application.  The user can either click "Gather diagnostics" or "Quit".



I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

wsl --version

```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

```

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

[@Nelson](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

[@22f2001640](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f2001640) in that case

* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a FastAPI application potentially experiencing issues with filtering by the 'class' query parameter. The browser displays an error response containing a list of all students, regardless of the 'class' parameter specified in the URL (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=1S`). The error message is: `Error: Response [{"studentId":1,"class":"101"},...]`.  The terminal shows successful 200 OK responses for both GET and OPTIONS requests to the API with various 'class' parameter combinations. The problem description states that the API should filter students based on the provided classes in the URL.

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The *only* thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api *not* the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:  
I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.  
And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.  



> **Image:** The user is encountering a `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource` when trying to access their Vercel deployed API. The UI element showing the problematic URL (`https://shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api`) is highlighted with an error indicator. The Network tab in the browser's developer tools shows a GET request to this API with a status code of `200 OK` but also indicates a `CORS Missing Allow Origin` error. A POST request to "exam.sana...completions" resulted in a 500 error. The provided example JSON response is `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.



I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “\*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.  
Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks  
Kushagra

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

Kind regards

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows an error encountered during image uploading. The user is attempting to upload "shapes_compressed.png" with the requirement being a losslessly compressed image smaller than 1,500 bytes. The error message states: "Error: Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original". This suggests a potential issue with image format compatibility or discrepancies between the uploaded image's pixels and the expected original. The "Choose File" button is a standard UI element for file selection.

i am getting this error  



> **Image:** The user is attempting to deploy a Python application to Vercel and is encountering an issue with fetching data from their deployed API endpoint. The desired API call format is `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`, which should return a JSON response like `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.  The user has entered the Vercel URL `https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api` into a designated input field.  An error message `TypeError: Failed to fetch` appears below the URL input, indicating a problem with retrieving data from the provided endpoint.



  
i have tried to submit it will a query as well but than also it is giving me the same error.But for me it is giving me the correct output.

The URL `student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api?name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV` suggests an API call to retrieve student marks. The JSON response shows a key "marks" with a value that is an array containing the numbers 65 and 74: `{"marks": [65, 74]}`. The "Pretty-print" checkbox is enabled, indicating the JSON data is formatted for readability. The data returned is likely causing issues further down in the data pipeline.

While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

[@23F300327](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f300327) You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on [youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is [meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy](http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy)

[@23F300327](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f300327)

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api  
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

```
# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

```

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.  
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:  
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues [TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.  
For example `https://tds21jan.vercel.app/`.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a deployment error within the Vercel platform. The error displayed is "404: NOT_FOUND" with the code also being "NOT_FOUND" and a specific ID. The deployment, under the domain "tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app," currently has a "Ready" status despite the 404 error on at least one of the domains. A suggestion is made to connect the project to a Git repository for production deployment.

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow [Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to [this guide on DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k). I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

The user has entered a URL, but the system displays an error message: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: <!DOCTYPE HTML> ... Error code: 501 ... Unsupported method ('POST')...

This suggests the provided ngrok URL is resulting in an HTML response indicating a server error, specifically an unsupported POST request, rather than valid JSON. The error appears directly below the input field where the ngrok URL was entered within the course platform UI. The assignment is graded, and the "Check" button indicates a validation process.

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search [Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It)](https://www.lifewire.com/error-524-a-timeout-occurred-4782741). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

Hi Irina,

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

Here is reference of error [ERR\_NGROK\_8012 | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_8012/)

Regarding question no. 9 Web Framework: FastAPI. I got the following error for the answer to the question  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a debugging session related to a FastAPI application. The expected API endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. A visible error message "Error: Response undefined does not match expected" indicates a mismatch between the actual API response and the expected data, which is a list of student IDs and class names formatted as a JSON array. The documentation mentions the use of the "class" query parameter in the URL. The expected API response structure is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a student with keys "studentid" and "class".



  
But when I run the url in my browser I got the following response  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays JSON data fetched from the local server `127.0.0.1:8000/api`. The URL includes multiple 'class' parameters (e.g., `class=6X`, `class=57`, `class=78`, `class=2Z`), likely intended to filter results.  The data is a list of student objects; each object contains 'studentId' and 'class' key-value pairs. It appears the response contains student data associated with various class values. There is no visible error message, just the raw data response.



  
I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from direct running of url both are same. I don’t find any difference.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

1. Open Squoosh and load the image
2. In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
3. The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes



> **Image:** The screenshot displays UI elements for image compression settings. The "Edit" section allows toggling "Resize" and "Reduce palette". The "Compress" section lets the user select the compression algorithm, with "OxiPNG" currently selected.  Other settings visible are "Interlace" which is a checkbox and "Effort:", which is a slider currently set to 2. The image has been compressed by "63%" resulting in a file size of "1.41 kB".



I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

The UI shows a resulting 83% reduction in size to 630 B, and checkboxes for "Discrete tone image" and "Preserve transparent data" are available.  A download button is visible, implying the user is preparing to save the compressed image.

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

On the right, a server rack visualization displays IP addresses "255.255.0.0" and metrics such as fan RPM "148". The "SERVER" section includes numerical values of "8025 - 5128" which suggest network activity or assigned ports. Lower down, "1280" and "SAP" are visible near potential memory or bandwidth usage indicators.

Textual elements indicate "VMS vs CONTAINERS," suggesting a comparative analysis. The bottom text emphasizes that the presented material is "ANIMATED."

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

hi [@23f2003853](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2003853)

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a forum question about a Vercel URL, asking users to input their app URL with the `/api` endpoint.  An example URL is provided as `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The user inputted `https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api`. An error message "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]" indicates a string comparison or encoding issue, specifically failing a check on the Vercel URL provided by the user. The prompt reminds the user to enable CORS.



Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel, just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards

> **Image:** Here's a breakdown of the code:

The code defines a handler for HTTP requests, using the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class.  It handles `GET` requests to retrieve marks based on a 'name' query parameter.  If the 'name' parameter is missing, it returns a JSON error message: `{"error": "Please provide a 'name' query parameter"}`. If the name is found, it returns marks. If not found, `{"error": "Name not found"}` is returned.  CORS headers are set for both `GET` and `OPTIONS` requests to allow cross-origin requests.



  
Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.  
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

For Graded Assignment 2 Q6, I’m getting the right answer but in portal it throws an error.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the output of a deployed API endpoint hosted on Vercel. The URL, `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api?name="dzPtdczl9"`, indicates a GET request with a parameter `name` set to `dzPtdczl9`. The API returns a JSON response: `{"marks":[65]}`, indicating the API call successfully retrieves a value. The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the output might be formatted if selected, improving readability.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science assignment involving deploying a Python API on Vercel. Students are instructed to handle GET requests with name parameters and return JSON responses of student marks. The intended format of the JSON response is visible: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`. A student has input their Vercel URL, `https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`, which is highlighted in red. An error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is also visible, indicating a problem accessing the deployed API, possibly due to CORS issues as mentioned in the instructions.



This is my vercel deployment

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a user attempting to query a FastAPI endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.  The user encounters an error: "Response undefined does not match expected". The error message reveals that the expected response is a JSON array of objects, where each object has keys "studentId" (an integer) and "class" (a string). The user is prompted to add the query parameter `?class=` to the URL and verify if the response matches the anticipated data structure.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the JSON response from a local API endpoint, `127.0.0.1:8000/api`, filtered by multiple class parameters in the URL: `class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. The response is an array of objects, each containing `studentId` and `class` key-value pairs. A "Pretty-print" checkbox is visible, suggesting a UI feature to format the JSON output. The JSON data represents a list of students, each associated with a specific class. The user seems to be querying the API to retrieve students belonging to a set of specific classes.



TDS GA2 Q9, I have passed the same class as of the error thrown test case for ease of reference. Both are same to same. Yet I’m getting error when i submit the answer. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , Kindly please clarify what I’m doing wrong.

[@23F3002987\_J\_SRI\_BAL](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f3002987_j_sri_bal) ,

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a "Team Access Required" error within a Vercel deployment, accessed via the URL "https://vercel.com/sso/access/request?next=%2Fsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-proj...". The user, "jivraj-18," is signed in but lacks team membership to access a specific deployment URL.  The error message clarifies that the user cannot access this "unique deployment URL".  The user is advised to request access to the "up-to-date deployment URL" to view the latest version. There is also an option to log in with a different Vercel account.



Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Vercel deployment with a "Not Found" error: "The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again." The URL in the address bar is `https://vercel.com/jivraj-18s-projects/api`. The deployment status is listed as "Ready" and was created on "28 Jan by jivraj-18."  The domain associated is "api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app". The user might be accessing the wrong URL, as evidenced by the error message.



If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts.

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a JSON response from an API endpoint `api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. The response is an array of objects, each containing "studentId" and "class" key-value pairs. The Network tab of the Chrome DevTools shows a successful (200) GET request to the same API endpoint, taking 12ms and returning 694B. The "Issues" tab reports a warning: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute". This likely relates to the frontend implementation and not the data itself.



  



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a JSON response from the API endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`.  The JSON data contains an array of objects, each representing a student with `studentId` and `class` fields. The browser's developer console (Console tab selected) displays a warning: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute". This indicates an issue related to missing attributes in HTML form elements, unrelated to the API response itself. There are no data visualizations present.



  
[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , Thankyou for the quick response. I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to.

The student is attempting to access a Vercel URL ("https://tdsproject1-Itjsdpii1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api") and encountering a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error.

Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if **name** == ‘**main**’:

24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.

I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python script `fast.py` open in an IDE, likely related to a FastAPI application. The code reads data from a CSV file named "data.csv" using `data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")`. An API endpoint `/api` is defined using `@app.get("/api")`, which takes a query parameter `class_name`. The code then queries the loaded data for a specific `city` and extracts its `population`.



  
the async def root() this command line in image is solution for our problem.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You *do not* create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

What am i missing here? i am also facing same issue, question 9 . attached screenshots.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays two near-identical JSON structures, likely output from a "JSON Diff" tool. Each structure consists of an array of objects, where each object has "class" and "studentId" keys.  Example: `{"class": "1N", "studentId": 60}`.  The URL `localhost:8000/api` suggests the JSON data is served from a local API endpoint, possibly as a response from a data science application.  The task appears to be identifying the semantic differences between the two JSON datasets.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science assignment involving a FastAPI endpoint that should return students based on the 'class' query parameter. The UI shows an error message "Response undefined does not match expected..." followed by a JSON payload of expected student data. The Network tab shows the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1N&class=8N&class=8X&class=4Z` and its preview response, a JSON list of students with their studentId and class. The task instructions state the API should return only students in the specified classes in the same order as in the CSV file. The CORS must be enabled.

This is correct for which have a object with key `students` which is not present in your response.

@ carlton @ Jivraj  
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.  
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.  
Do I need to do anything else ?  
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.  
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a user attempting to provide a Docker image URL. The expected format is `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`. The user-provided URL is `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general`, but the system returns an error: "Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags". The error indicates that the tag "23f2000573" is not a valid tag for the given repository, suggesting a potential typo or incorrect tag specified in the URL. A "Check" button implies the user is trying to validate their input.



I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal interaction where the user "giri" attempts to run a Docker container named "23f2000573/first-rep:v1" using the command "docker run 23f2000573/first-rep:v1". After running the Docker command, the terminal displays "abc.py". This suggests that "abc.py" is either a file name related to the container's execution or some kind of output from it. The user likely intended to execute a Python script named "abc.py" within the Docker container. It is unclear from the context if the container execution was successful or resulted in an error.



This is how my docker hub repository looks,



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Docker Hub repository page for "23f2000573/first-rep." It indicates that the repository contains one tag, "v1", which is an Image type.  The repository was last pushed 19 minutes ago, and its size is 364.1 MB.  The "Docker commands" section displays the command `docker push 23f2000573/first-rep:tagname`, suggesting a need to push a new tag to the repository. The UI displays repository name, tags, build settings, and offers an upgrade to automated builds.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a web application's API response, visible at the URL `new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m`. The response is a JSON object: `{"marks": [5,78]}`.

Try these [@21f3000745](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f3000745)

1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
   **If this doesn’t work, then:**
2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

For the **ngrok tunnel** question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to **keep all servers running** when clicking the **Save** button.

Also, I couldn’t find the **GitHub Pages URL** in your **GA2 response**, and many answers are unmarked. It seems you **didn’t click the Save button**.

Your current score is **4.5/10**.

I am facing several problems with the submission portal …

1. In question no 5 I entered the answer 78918 It was correct , I submitted it after few hours when I reloaded the portal its showing incorrect … I tried to enter twice thrice also solved it again but no use…
2. In question 10 I entered the required link it was correct after saving it and reloading the portal it shows incorrect …
3. In question 9 I did all the necessary thing but the portal is showing couldn’t fetch … My system is able to fetch the data but the portal says “failed to fetch”



> **Image:** Okay, here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a terminal output from a FastAPI application running with Uvicorn on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The application startup appears successful, indicated by "Application startup complete."  However, there are two "404 Not Found" errors: "GET / HTTP/1.1" and "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1," suggesting a missing root route and favicon. Successful "200 OK" responses are observed for GET requests to "/api" and "/api?class=1A", meaning this part of the api is working. The terminal tab is selected, and the environment used is python3.12 - Fastapi.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a JSON response from the API endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`.  The JSON structure contains a "students" array, where each element is a dictionary with "studentId" and "class" keys. All students have the class "1A". The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests this is a formatted output for readability in the browser. The goal is likely to debug the structure and data retrieved from this API call.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a student submitting an API URL in a data science course, aiming to filter students by class using a `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A`). The student has entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" as the API endpoint. Upon clicking the "Check" button, the system encountered a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating a problem with the API request.  The course material stresses enabling CORS and notes the system sends a request to the provided URL with `?class=...` to validate the response.

Hi [@23f2000573](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000573) ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use  



> **Image:** The screenshot provides instructions for building, running, and deploying a container using Podman. The instructions start with logging into Docker Hub via "podman login docker.io." The next steps involve building the container with "podman build -t py-hello ." and running it using "podman run -it py-hello". Finally, it pushes the container to Docker Hub, requiring replacement of "$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME" and demonstrates adding a tag with the command "TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG".

Hi [@24f1002359](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the Chrome DevTools console tab, indicating a JavaScript error. The error message "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." indicates a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue. The JavaScript code, executed from a file loaded with null origin is attempting to make an AJAX request to google.com, but the server is not allowing the request due to missing CORS headers. Console also shows "starting ajax request to the resource" and "ajax request done" that precede the error in order.



For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

and

This annotation indicates that `class_` can be either a list of strings or None, and that it's sourced from a query parameter named "class". The default value for `class_` is set to `None`.

Hi [@24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a `.nojekyll` file in your root folder of your repository.

I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a problem with a FastAPI application returning student data. The API endpoint, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, returns a list of students, each with a `studentId` and `class`. The displayed error indicates that the `Response` does not match the `expected` data, specifically that the returned student data is not in the correct order or contains incorrect data based on the requested query parameter (which is hinted at with `?class=...`). The instructions state to ensure CORS is enabled and provide an example usage of query parameters (`/api?class=1A`, `/api?class=1A&class=1B`) to filter by class.



The /api is working perfectly fine manually either I specify the class or without it  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON response from an API endpoint "127.0.0.1:8000/api".  The root element "students" contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains "studentId" (an integer) and "class" (a string). The data appears to be a list of students and their corresponding class assignments, with IDs ranging from 1 to 252. No error messages are visible; the page seems to be displaying the API response successfully.



Sample class example that I tried manually is below  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays JSON data retrieved from a local API endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`.  The "Pretty-print" label suggests the data is formatted for readability. The JSON structure contains a "students" array, where each student object has "studentId" and "class" attributes. All student objects have the class value "3Q". There are no visible error messages, suggesting the API request was successful.



The main code is below

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

This suggests the user has not completed the assignment, resulting in no available score data. The primary issue is the "Not Submitted" status, indicating a missing assignment.

Even there is no submission button provided in GA2 and GA3 on the portal unlike Graded Assignment 1.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a webpage for "Graded Assignment 2" where the due date "2025-02-02, 23:59 IST" has passed.  The text suggests potential access issues related to ad blockers, cookie settings, JavaScript requirements, and browser extensions.  It emphasizes the use of the correct Student Id (example: "22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") for the assignment submission.  The page includes a link to the assignment: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2". There are no data visualizations visible.

We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Regards,  
TDS TA

Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.

Actually even on the portal it’s showing like this:  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a quiz interface from an "IITM Online Degree" course related to "TDS 2025 Jan GA1".  The assignment ended on "Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and the current "Score: 0," with options to "Check all" or "Save". There are instructions like "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed," along with advice on when to take TDS.  The user is logged in as "22f2001630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," and recent saves are listed as "Reload from 1/25/2025, 10:56:53 PM. Score: 6.5."



  
So it’s confusing.

Just Checked my Score Card.  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a student's dashboard on the IIT Madras online degree platform. It shows the student's current courses, "Tools in Data Science" (marked as "NEW COURSE") and "Business Data Management - Project" (marked as "RETRY PROJECT"). The student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is listed as 8.3, while the Project CGPA is 0.0.  Navigational links are present ("Go to Course page >" and "Go to Project page >") for accessing specific course content. The URL indicates this is the "current_courses" section of the student dashboard.



  
Thank you for your attention to our problems you are the real heroes.

A "Reload" button exists for a saved state at "02/02/2025, 21:49:25" with "Score: 5.5".
