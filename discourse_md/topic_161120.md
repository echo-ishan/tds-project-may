> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely an automated grading or submission system, attempting to validate a student's GitHub Pages deployment.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** The system is prompting the user to input their GitHub Pages URL, providing a common format (`https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`).
2.  **User Input Status:** There's an empty input field marked with a red border and an exclamation mark icon, indicating that the field is currently invalid or requires input. This suggests either the user hasn't entered a URL yet, or a previously entered URL led to the error shown.
3.  **Error Type:** The error indicates a content validation failure. The system successfully accessed a webpage (likely at the user's provided GitHub Pages URL), but it could not find a specific identifier (`22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) within the content of the retrieved HTML response.
4.  **Accessed Page Content:** The error message includes a partial HTML structure of the page that was accessed.
    *   It's a standard HTML5 document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).
    *   The page has the title **"Dolphin Facts"**. This is crucial as it indicates the specific project or content the student is expected to have deployed.
    *   It includes basic meta tags for character set (`UTF-8`) and viewport configuration.
    *   There's an inline `<style>` block setting basic CSS for the `body`, including font family (Arial, sans-serif), background color (`#e0f7fa`), text color (`#333`), and `text-align` (truncated).
5.  **Problem for the User:** The student's "Dolphin Facts" page, while accessible, does not contain the required student ID/email (`22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) necessary for validation. The user needs to embed this identifier into their HTML page to pass the check.

---

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Prompt/Instruction:**
    ```
    What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/
    ```

*   **Error Message (partial, as truncated in image):**
    ```
    Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <title>Dolphin Facts</title> <style> body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #e0f7fa; color: #333; text-align:

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum depicts a user attempting to configure or test a Vercel API endpoint, encountering a common client-side network error.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Objective:** The user is prompted to provide a "Vercel URL" for an application, specifically indicating that it "should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`". This suggests the system is expecting an API endpoint hosted on Vercel.

2.  **User Input:** The user has entered the following URL into a text input field, which is highlighted with a red border (typically indicating an error or invalid state):
    `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`
    This URL adheres to the expected format, replacing `your-app` with `markdarshan`.

3.  **Observed Error:** Immediately below the input field, a red error message is displayed, indicating a problem with the entered URL.

---

### Transcriptions:

*   **Prompt/Instruction Text:**
    ```
    What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api
    ```

*   **User-Entered URL (within input field):**
    ```
    https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api
    ```

*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    TypeError: Failed to fetch
    ```

---

### Analysis:

The `TypeError: Failed to fetch` message is a client-side network error. It typically means that the browser or application attempting to make a request to the specified URL (`https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`) was unable to successfully complete the network request. This is distinct from HTTP errors (like 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error), which indicate the request *reached* the server but the server responded with an error.

Common reasons for a `Failed to fetch` error include:

*   **Network connectivity issues:** The user's device might be offline or have intermittent network problems.
*   **Incorrect URL:** While the format appears correct, there might be a typo in the domain (`markdarshan.vercel.app`) that prevents DNS resolution.
*   **CORS policy issues:** If the application making the request is hosted on a different domain than `markdarshan.vercel.app`, the Vercel API might be blocking cross-origin requests (CORS), leading to a network error on the client side.
*   **Server not reachable/down:** The Vercel application/API at `markdarshan.vercel.app` might not be deployed, might be down, or might not be configured to serve requests at the `/api` endpoint.
*   **Mixed content issues:** If the client application is served over HTTPS but tries to fetch from an HTTP URL (not applicable here as both are HTTPS).
*   **Browser extensions or firewalls:** Occasionally, security software or browser extensions can interfere with network requests.

The user should verify the deployment status of their Vercel application, check for any network restrictions, and ensure their Vercel API is correctly configured and publicly accessible from the origin where the fetch request is being made.*



  
that website is working fine . just write the parameters after /api

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a data science student's environment, demonstrating a FastAPI application running via Uvicorn, its associated code, and terminal output during API testing.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Python Code Editor (`main.py`):**
This window displays the source code for a FastAPI application, named `main.py`.

*   **Imports:**
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
    from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
    from typing import List, Optional
    import csv
    ```
*   **FastAPI App Initialization:**
    ```python
    app = FastAPI()
    ```
*   **CORS Configuration:** The application is configured with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware, allowing requests from any origin, with credentials, and any method/header. This is crucial for enabling frontend applications hosted on different domains/ports to interact with this API.
    ```python
    # Enable CORS
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"], # Allow all origins
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"], # Allow all methods
        allow_headers=["*"], # Allow all headers
    )
    ```
*   **Data Loading:** The application loads student data from a CSV file located in the user's Downloads folder. Each row is read as a dictionary, and `studentId` is cast to an integer.
    ```python
    # Load student data from the specified CSV file
    students = []
    with open('/Users/mish/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv', mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            students.append({
                "studentId": int(row["studentId"]),
                "class": row["class"]
            })
    ```
*   **API Endpoint (`/api`):**
    A GET endpoint `/api` is defined. It's an asynchronous function `get_students` that can optionally take a `class_` query parameter, which is expected to be a list of strings (e.g., `?class_=1A&class_=2B`).
    *   If `class_` is provided, it filters the `students` list to return only those whose 'class' matches any of the requested classes.
    *   If `class_` is not provided, it returns all students.
    *   Debugging `print` statements are included to show the `Requested classes` and `Filtered students`.
    ```python
    @app.get("/api")
    async def get_students(class_: Optional[List[str]] = Query(None)):
        print(f"Requested classes: {class_}") # Debugging line
        if class_:
            filtered_students = [student for student in students if student["class"] in class_]
            print(f"Filtered students: {filtered_students}") # Debugging line
            return {"students": filtered_students}
        return {"students": students}
    ```
*   **Uvicorn Server Execution:** The standard block to run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) at port `8000`.
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import uvicorn
        uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
    ```

**2. Terminal Window (Uvicorn Output):**
This terminal is running the Uvicorn server with the `--reload` flag, which automatically reloads the application when code changes are detected.

*   **Uvicorn Command:**
    ```
    % uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
*   **Dependency Check (Requirement already satisfied):**
    ```
    0->fastapi) (4.8.0)
    Requirement already satisfied: idna>=2.8 in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.4.0->starlette<0.37.0,>=0.36.0->fastapi) (3.10)

    ```
*   **Uvicorn Startup Logs:**
    ```
    INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/Users/mish/Documents']
    INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO: Started reloader process [40673] using StatReload
    INFO: Started server process [40675]
    INFO: Waiting for application startup.
    INFO: Application startup complete.
    ```
*   **API Request Logs and Debugging Output:**
    The logs show various HTTP requests made to the Uvicorn server, along with their status codes, and the `print` statements from the `main.py` code.
    ```
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:52529 - "OPTIONS /?class=1A&class=8A&class=8D&class=7N HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:52530 - "GET /?class=1A&class=8A&class=8D&class=7N HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    INFO: 404 Not Found
    Requested classes: None
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:52531 - "GET /api HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    Requested classes: ['1A']
    INFO: 127.0.0.1:52535 - "GET /api?class=1A HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    ```
    *   Observations: There's an `OPTIONS` request (likely a CORS preflight) and a `GET` request for multiple classes (`1A`, `8A`, `8D`, `7N`), both successful (200 OK).
    *   There's an unhandled `404 Not Found` request, indicating a client tried to access an endpoint that doesn't exist. This might be a browser's default behavior trying to fetch a favicon or another asset.
    *   Subsequent requests to `/api` are logged: one without any class parameter (resulting in `Requested classes: None` being printed), and another specifically for `class=1A` (resulting in `Requested classes: ['1A']` being printed). Both `GET /api` requests return `200 OK`.

**3. Web Application/Forum Window:**
This window appears to be from a learning platform or a documentation site, providing instructions or context for the exercise.

*   **Header:** "Documents - Python uvicorn main:app --reload - 80x24"
*   **Content:**
    ```
    API application using Uvicorn:
    ```
    It has buttons like "Verify" and "Reload," suggesting interactive components for testing or validating the student's progress.
    ```
    Verify        ▷   ▢
    ```
    A truncated sentence:
    ```
    You should see output indicating that Uvicorn is
    ```

**Overall Context:**
The user "mish" is setting up and testing a simple FastAPI application. The application exposes an API endpoint `/api` that serves student data loaded from a CSV, with filtering capabilities based on class. The terminal shows the live logging of API calls made to the Uvicorn server, demonstrating that the API is responding correctly to various query parameters. The third window provides instructional context for this task, likely from an online data science or web development course. The presence of debug `print` statements in the code and their output in the terminal suggests an active debugging or learning process.*

Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum displays an `ERR_NGROK_8012` error page, indicating an issue with an ngrok tunnel connecting to a local web service.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Error Type:** The main error is identified as `ERR_NGROK_8012`.
2.  **Connection Flow Status:** A visual diagram at the top illustrates the connection stages:
    *   Internet: Connected (Green dot)
    *   ngrok Edge: Connected (Green dot)
    *   ngrok Agent: Connected (Green dot)
    *   Your Service: Failed (Red 'X'). This indicates that ngrok successfully received traffic and its agent is running, but it failed to connect to the intended local service.
3.  **Problem Description:** The error message clearly states that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent could not establish a connection to the upstream web service.
4.  **Target Service Address:** The upstream web service ngrok was trying to connect to is `http://localhost:8080`.
5.  **Root Cause of Error:** The specific error message indicates a "connection refused" by the target service, meaning nothing was listening on `localhost:8080` or the service explicitly rejected the connection attempt.
6.  **Troubleshooting for Developers:** The page advises the developer to ensure a web service is actively running on `http://localhost:8080` on the machine where the ngrok agent is running. It also suggests using `cURL` or a browser to test the local service directly.
7.  **Troubleshooting for Visitors:** For end-users, the page suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing, or contacting the developer if the issue persists.
8.  **Help Links:** Links to "Get help with this error" are provided, likely redirecting to ngrok's documentation or support pages.

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

### Post #17 by **Nelson Jochim DSouza** (ds-students)
*January 14, 2025, 11:23 UTC*
I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an error message from **Docker Desktop**, specifically concerning an **Unexpected WSL error**.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Application and High-Level Error:**
*   **Application:** Docker Desktop
*   **Error Title:** "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error"
*   **General Description:** "An unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command."

**2. Suggested Troubleshooting Steps:**
The dialog provides several immediate and more advanced troubleshooting steps:
*   "Either shut down WSL down with `wsl --shutdown` , and/or reboot your machine."
*   "You can also try reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop."
*   "If the issue persists, collect diagnostics and submit an issue." (This is a clickable link).

**3. Detailed Error Message / Log Output (Transcribed Exactly):**
The core of the error is shown in a dark gray text block:
```
deploying WSL2 distributions
ensuring main distro is deployed: deploying "docker-
desktop": importing WSL distro "WSL2 is not supported with
```
*   **Analysis:** This message indicates that Docker Desktop is attempting to deploy or import a WSL2 distribution, likely for its internal operations ("docker-desktop"). The error states that "WSL2 is not supported with" something, but the message is unfortunately truncated, making the exact cause unclear. It implies a compatibility issue or a missing component/configuration required for WSL2 integration with Docker.

**4. Interactive Elements / Buttons:**
*   **Gather diagnostics** (Button)
*   **Quit** (Button)

**5. Additional Links:**
*   **collect diagnostics and submit an issue** (Clickable link, repeating the suggestion from the text)
*   **Read our policy for uploaded diagnostic data** (Clickable link)

**In Summary:** The user is experiencing a critical error preventing Docker Desktop from functioning, specifically related to its interaction with Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). The error points to an issue during the deployment or import of a WSL2 distribution required by Docker, with the specific incompatibility reason being cut off from the display. The dialog offers standard troubleshooting steps like shutting down WSL, rebooting, or reinstalling components, and provides options to gather diagnostics for further support.*



I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

wsl --version

```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

[@Nelson](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

[@22f2001640](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f2001640) in that case

* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user working on a data science course assignment involving a FastAPI application.

Here's the key information observed:

**1. Assignment Context (Right Browser Window):**
*   **Assignment Title:** Graded Assignment
*   **Due Date:** Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST
*   **Current Score:** 5.5 / 10 (Indicates partial completion/correctness)
*   **Assignment Task:** Implement a FastAPI endpoint (`/api`) that accepts one or more `class` query parameters.
    *   **Instruction Snippet 1:** "If the URL has a query parameter `class`, it should return only students in those classes. For example, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. `/api?class=1A&class=1B` should return only students in class 1A and 1B. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes)."
    *   **Instruction Snippet 2 (CORS):** "Ensure that you have **CORS** enabled. Otherwise, we can't send requests to your server."
    *   **Expected API URL:** "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`"
*   **User Inputted API Endpoint:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **Grading System Error:** Despite the correct API endpoint, the grading system reports an error.
    *   **Error Message (exactly as it appears, truncated by image):**
        ```
        Error: Response [{"studentId":1,"class":"10I"},{"studentId":2,"class":"12M"},{"studentId":3,"class":"5V"},{"studentId":4,"class":"2M"},{"studentId":5,"class":"9E"},{"studentId":6,"class":"7U"},{"studentId":7,"class":"12P"},{"studentId":8,"class":"4Y"},{"studentId":9,"class":"9Q"},{"studentId":10,"class":"4G"},{"studentId":11,"class":"8I"},{"studentId":12,"class":"7G"},{"studentId":13,"class":"11L"},{"studentId":14,"class":"11I"},{"studentId":15,"class":"10T"},{"studentId":16,"class":"7C"},{"studentId":17,"class":"9G"},{"studentId":18,"class":"5P"},{"studentId":19,"class":"5R"},{"studentId":20,"class":"5R"},{"studentId":21,"class":"8N"},{"studentId":22,"class":"2F"},{"studentId":23,"class":"10U"},{"studentId":24,"class":"1P"},{"studentId":25,"class":"6R"},{"studentId":26,"class":"8W"},{"studentId":27,"class":"9U"},{"studentId":28,"class":"5X"},{"studentId":29,"class":"2Z"},{"studentId":30,"class":"8U"},{"studentId":31,"class":"7D"},{"studentId":32,"class":"11Q"},{"studentId":33,"class":"1L"},{"studentId":34,"class":"2W"},{"studentId":35,"class":"8I"},{"studentId":36,"class":"2U"},{"studentId":37,"class":"8L"},{"studentId":38,"class":"3V"},
        ```
        *Interpretation:* The error message shows that the *response content itself* (a large JSON array of student objects) is being flagged as an error by the grading system. This implies that for a particular test case, the grading system might have expected a different response (e.g., an empty list, a specific error format, or a different subset of data) but received a comprehensive list of students.

**2. Local API Test (Left Browser Window):**
*   **URL Tested:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=1S`
*   **Response (Pretty print, exactly as it appears):**
    ```json
    {
      "students": [
        {"studentId":280,"class":"1S"},
        {"studentId":298,"class":"1S"},
        {"studentId":498,"class":"1S"},
        {"studentId":1501,"class":"1S"}
      ]
    }
    ```
    *Interpretation:* This shows a successful API call to the local server, returning a list of students belonging to class "1S". The response structure (`{"students": [...]}`) appears consistent.

**3. FastAPI Server Logs (Terminal Window):**
*   **Process Name:** `mish — Python main.py`
*   **Server Type:** FastAPI (implied by context) running on Uvicorn (indicated by logs).
*   **Key Log Entries (exactly as they appear, selective examples):**
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61976 - "GET /api?class_=1S&class_=2A HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61990 - "OPTIONS /api?class=11V&class=7X&class=9P HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61991 - "GET /api?class=11V&class=7X&class=9P HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61993 - "OPTIONS /api?class=5V&class=3G&class=12Q HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61994 - "GET /api?class=5V&class=3G&class=12Q HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61994 - "OPTIONS /api?class=12I&class=5Q&class=1J HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61994 - "GET /api?class=12I&class=5Q&class=1J HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61998 - "OPTIONS /api?class_=1S&class_=2A HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:62001 - "OPTIONS /api?class=3L&class=11I&class=6Y HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:62002 - "GET /api?class=3L&class=11I&class=6Y HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:62005 - "GET /api?class_=1S HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:62008 - "OPTIONS /api?class=2R&class=8S&class=9S&class=6A HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:62009 - "GET /api?class=2R&class=8S&class=9S&class=6A HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *Interpretation:* The logs show that the FastAPI server is running, actively handling `GET` requests to `/api` with various `class` query parameters (including multiple parameters, e.g., `class_=1S&class_=2A`). Crucially, it's also handling `OPTIONS` requests successfully, which confirms that CORS is likely properly configured on the server, as required by the assignment. All requests shown return a `200 OK` status, indicating no HTTP-level errors from the server.

**Summary of the Problem:**
The user's local FastAPI application appears to be functioning correctly, handling different `class` query parameters and CORS requests, and returning `200 OK` responses with what seems to be valid data. The core issue lies with the grading system's interpretation of the API's response. The `Error: Response [...]` message suggests that the grading script received a list of students when it likely expected a different output for a particular test case. This is an application-level response validation failure, not an HTTP error. The student needs to review the exact expected output format or edge case handling for the grading system's tests.*

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an `ngrok` error page, indicating a problem with exposing a local web service to the internet.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Context & Application:**
*   The URL `9eab-2402-e280-3e1e-19a-508b-9d2e-a63e-931c.ngrok-free.app` clearly identifies the service as `ngrok`, which is used to create secure tunnels from a public endpoint to a locally running web service.
*   The browser tabs suggest the user is likely a developer or student in a data science course, working on topics like "Graded Assis", "GA2 - Deplo" (Deployment), "TDS 2025 J", "Llama-3-2-1", "AI Chat", and "Push Docker", all of which involve deploying or interacting with local web services.

**2. Error Status Diagram:**
*   A visual flow diagram shows the status of the connection:
    *   **Internet:** Green checkmark (OK)
    *   **ngrok Edge:** Green checkmark (OK)
    *   **ngrok Agent:** Green checkmark (OK)
    *   **Your Service:** Red 'X' (Failure)
*   This diagram precisely pinpoints where the connection broke down: the ngrok agent successfully received traffic but failed to connect to the local service it was supposed to expose.

**3. Error Message Details:**
*   **Error Code:** `ERR_NGROK_8012`
*   **Description:** "Traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:5000`."
*   **Specific Connection Error:** This is the crucial part, showing the underlying network issue.

**4. Advice for the Developer:**
*   This section provides direct troubleshooting steps for the user, confirming they are expected to be the developer of the "Your Service".
*   It advises ensuring a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000` on the machine where the ngrok agent is active.
*   It suggests testing the local service directly using `cURL` or opening `http://localhost:5000` in a browser.

**5. Advice for a Visitor:**
*   This section offers general advice for someone who might just be visiting the broken page, suggesting to wait, refresh, or contact the developer.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages (exactly as they appear):**

*   **Error Code:**
    `ERR_NGROK_8012`

*   **Upstream Service Address:**
    `http://localhost:5000`

*   **Specific Connection Error Message:**

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The *only* thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api *not* the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:  
I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.  
And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user encountering a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error while trying to test an API deployed on Vercel for a data science course assignment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. User's Context and Goal:**
*   The user is working on an assignment that requires them to:
    *   Download a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json` containing marks for 100 imaginary students.
    *   Create and deploy a Python application to Vercel.
    *   Expose an API endpoint (`/api`) on the Vercel app.
    *   This API should accept `name` query parameters (e.g., `?name=X&name=Y`).
    *   The API should return a JSON response containing the marks for the specified names, in the format: `{ "marks": [value1, value2] }`. The example provided is `{ "marks": [10, 20] }`.
*   The user is attempting to validate their deployed Vercel API by entering its URL into a field, likely provided by the course platform.

**2. Observed Behavior and Errors:**
*   **User Input URL:** The user has entered `https://vercel-[redacted]-shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api` into the Vercel URL input field.
*   **Immediate Error Message (on page):** Below the input field, a prominent red error message appears.
*   **Browser Developer Tools (Network Tab):**
    *   The Network tab is open, showing multiple HTTP requests made by the browser.
    *   One specific `GET` request is highlighted and detailed:
        *   **URL:** `https://[redacted]-shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api?name=QtCN&name=8UD&name=jkBviT6&name=4mRr&name=JXNEa`
        *   **Status:** `200` (OK) – This is crucial as it indicates the server responded successfully.
        *   **Type:** `json`
        *   **Key Indicator:** The `CORS Missing Allow Origin` flag is present next to the `json` type, which is the root cause of the error reported on the page.
        *   **Transferred Data:** `493 B (29 B size)` – A small amount of data was transferred, likely the JSON response itself.

**3. Analysis and Inferences:**
*   **The API is likely working on the server-side:** The `Status: 200` in the Network tab means that the Vercel Python application successfully received the request, processed it, and returned a response to the browser. This suggests the core logic of fetching marks based on names is potentially correct.
*   **The problem is client-side (CORS):** The `TypeError: NetworkError` on the page and the `CORS Missing Allow Origin` in the Network tab are directly related. Even though the server sent a successful response (HTTP 200), the browser *blocked* the calling script (which is likely running on a different domain, e.g., `exam.sana.co...`) from accessing that response. This happens because the Vercel API's response headers are missing the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, which is required by the browser's security policy to permit cross-origin requests.
*   **The user needs to configure CORS on their Vercel app:** To resolve this, the Python app deployed on Vercel needs to be updated to include appropriate CORS headers in its responses, typically `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (for development/testing, allowing any origin) or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [origin_of_course_platform]` (for production, restricting to the specific origin).

**4. Transcribed Information:**

*   **File Name:** `q-vercel-python.json`
*   **Example Expected API Request URL Structure:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`
*   **Example Expected API JSON Response:** `{ "marks": [10, 20] }`
*   **User Inputted Vercel URL (partially redacted):** `https://vercel-[redacted]-shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api`
*   **On-Page Error Message:** `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.`
*   **Network Request URL (partially redacted):** `https://[redacted]-shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api?name=QtCN&name=8UD&name=jkBviT6&name=4mRr&name=JXNEa`
*   **Network Request Status:** `200`
*   **Network Request Type/Error:** `json CORS Missing Allow Origin`
*   **Network Request Transferred Size:** `493 B (29 B size)`*



I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “\*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.  
Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks  
Kushagra

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The user is likely attempting to configure or input a Vercel URL for an application, possibly as part of a deployment or API integration step in a data science project.
*   **Prompt:** The forum is prompting the user to provide their Vercel URL, giving an explicit example of the expected format.
*   **User Input:** The user has entered a URL that closely matches the example format, substituting "your-app" with "your-app2".
*   **Issue:** The input field is highlighted in red, indicating a validation or connectivity error. An error message is displayed below the input, suggesting a problem with network communication or reaching the specified URL.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Instruction/Hint:**
    ```
    What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

Kind regards

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information

The screenshot displays a web form component for uploading an image, along with an error message indicating a failed upload.

1.  **Purpose:** The user is attempting to upload an image.
2.  **Upload Requirements:** The system explicitly states two constraints for the image upload:
    *   It must be "losslessly compressed".
    *   Its size must be "less than 1,500 bytes".
3.  **File Selection:** The user has selected a file named `shapes_compressed.png`. This suggests they have already attempted to compress an image and save it as a PNG, likely to meet the "losslessly compressed" requirement.
4.  **Error Status:** The file input field (`Choose File` and `shapes_compressed.png`) is highlighted with a red border, indicating an issue with the selected input.
5.  **Specific Error Message:** A detailed error message is displayed below the input field, explaining why the upload failed. The message is multi-part and quite specific:
    *   The system "Could not process image."
    *   It poses a question: "Is it a browser-supported image?". While `.png` is generally browser-supported, this might be a generic part of the error or a hint towards a malformed PNG.
    *   Crucially, it states: "Image pixels do not match the original". This suggests a validation failure where the uploaded image's content (pixel data) doesn't match an expected original, or perhaps it was corrupted during compression, transfer, or server-side processing, leading to an integrity check failure. This is a very specific error that goes beyond just file type or size.

### Transcriptions

*   **Instruction Text:** `Upload your losslessly compressed image (less than 1,500 bytes)`
*   **Button Label:** `Choose File`
*   **Selected File Name:** `shapes_compressed.png`
*   **Error Message:** `Error: Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original`*

i am getting this error  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely showing a problem statement, expected output, and a user's attempt at submitting a solution URL, along with an error message.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Task Description:**
The user is instructed to:
*   Download a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json` which contains marks for 100 imaginary students.
*   Create and deploy a Python application to Vercel.
*   Expose an API endpoint that, when a request is made with specific query parameters for student names (e.g., `name=X&name=Y`), returns a JSON response containing their marks.

**2. Expected API Behavior and Response:**
*   **Example Request URL Format:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`
    *   This implies the API should accept multiple `name` query parameters.
*   **Expected JSON Response Format:** A JSON object with a key `"marks"` and its value being a list of integers (the student marks).
    *   `{ "marks": [ 10, 20 ] }`

**3. User's Input and Problem:**
*   **Question Asked:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`"
*   **User's Submitted URL:** `https://student-marks-gb9zwnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api`
    *   This URL appears to follow the expected format for a Vercel deployment, including a unique subdomain and the `/api` path.
*   **Error Message:** `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
    *   This error suggests a network-level problem when the client (likely the forum's backend attempting to validate the URL) tried to connect to or receive a response from the provided Vercel URL. It's often indicative of issues like the server being unreachable, a DNS problem, a CORS policy block, or a dropped connection, rather than an application-level error (like a 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error).

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **Provided JSON File Name:** `q-vercel-python.json`
*   **Example API Request URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`
*   **Example JSON Response Format:**
    ```json
    { "marks": [ 10, 20 ] }
    ```
*   **Expected Vercel URL Structure (from prompt):** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`
*   **User's Submitted Vercel URL:** `https://student-marks-gb9zwnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api`
*   **Error Message:** `TypeError: Failed to fetch`*



  
i have tried to submit it will a query as well but than also it is giving me the same error.But for me it is giving me the correct output.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot, describing the key information and transcribing relevant details:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays the successful output of a web API call within a browser. It appears to be related to a system managing student marks, likely part of a data science project or a demonstration environment.

1.  **API Endpoint:** The URL in the address bar indicates an API endpoint hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web projects. The base URL suggests it's a personal project (`tushars-projects`) and includes a unique identifier (`student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-f2a54030.vercel.app`).
2.  **API Parameters:** The endpoint `/api` is being called with two query parameters, both named `name`, followed by seemingly encoded or unique identifiers: `IjJOGavw` and `Ry2N2zqyxV`. This structure suggests the API might be querying for marks associated with specific student identifiers.
3.  **Response Format:** The "Pretty-print" checkbox, which is checked, indicates that the browser or a browser extension is rendering the response in a human-readable, formatted way. This is typical for JSON data.
4.  **Response Data:** The body of the response is a JSON object. It contains a single key-value pair: `"marks": [65, 74]`. This implies that for the queried student(s) or entity, the associated marks are 65 and 74.

**Inferences for a Data Science Context:**

*   **Data Retrieval:** This is an example of fetching data from a web service (API), a common task in data science for obtaining datasets.
*   **JSON Data:** The data is returned in JSON format, which is a widely used and easily parsable format for data exchange in web applications. Data scientists frequently work with JSON data, converting it into structured formats like pandas DataFrames for analysis.
*   **API Design:** The API seems designed to retrieve specific student marks based on provided identifiers. This could be a component of a larger system where student performance is tracked or analyzed.
*   **Debugging/Exploration:** Screenshots like this are common in course forums when students are debugging API calls or demonstrating successful data retrieval.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **URL (API Request):**
    `student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api?name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV`

*   **Response Body (JSON Data):**
    ```json
    {
      "marks": [65, 74]
    }
    ```

*   No error messages are present; the API call appears to have been successful.*

i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error.  
what to do?  
i have added the cors in the app.py file as well

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from flask_cors import CORS


app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data
with open("q-vercel-python.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)


@app.route("/api", methods=["GET"])
def get_marks():
    names = request.args.getlist("name")
    marks = [student["marks"] for student in data if student["name"] in names]
    return jsonify({"marks": marks})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


```

[@23f2003751](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2003751)  
While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards

[@23F300327](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f300327) You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on [youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser (likely Google Chrome, given the UI elements and dark mode theme) interacting with a deployed web API.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **URL and API Endpoint:**
    *   **URL:** `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdkttz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k`
    *   **Deployment Platform:** The domain `vercel.app` indicates that the application is deployed on Vercel, a popular platform for hosting web applications and serverless functions.
    *   **Framework Hint:** The subdomain `vercel-fastapi-aa0kdkttz-mishkat02s-projects` strongly suggests that the backend API is built using **FastAPI**, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
    *   **Endpoint:** The path `/api` indicates the specific API endpoint being accessed.
    *   **Query Parameters:** The URL includes two query parameters: `name=IE` and `name=G6k`. This means the API is being called with two values for the `name` parameter. Depending on how the FastAPI application is designed, it might process these as a list of names or prioritize one over the other.

2.  **API Response (Output):**
    *   The main content area of the browser shows a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response.
    *   There's a "Pretty print" checkbox which is checked, meaning the raw JSON output has been formatted for human readability by the browser's built-in JSON viewer or an extension.
    *   **Transcribed Output:**
        ```json
        {"marks": [50,53]}
        ```
        This JSON object contains a single key, `"marks"`, whose value is a list (or array) of two integers: `50` and `53`.

3.  **Contextual Clues (Browser Tabs):**
    The open browser tabs provide additional context, suggesting an academic or project-based environment:
    *   "Project 1:.."
    *   "TDS 2025 J" (Likely "The Data Science 2025" or similar, indicating a course or program)
    *   "GA2 - Deploys" (Possibly "Group Assignment 2 - Deployments")
    *   "how to install" (Suggests troubleshooting or setup activities)
    *   "ChatGPT" (Commonly used by students and developers for assistance)
    *   Multiple "vercel-fastapi" tabs (Indicating active development or debugging of the Vercel-deployed FastAPI application).

**Summary of Key Information:**

The screenshot shows a user successfully making an HTTP GET request to a FastAPI application deployed on Vercel. The request includes two `name` query parameters (`IE` and `G6k`). The API responds with a JSON object containing a list of numerical "marks" (`[50, 53]`). Given the context of "TDS 2025" and "GA2 - Deploys," this is likely a student or developer demonstrating a part of their data science project, potentially an API that returns student grades or scores based on some input criteria (represented by the `name` parameters, although the direct mapping isn't visible from this single screenshot). The "Pretty print" feature indicates a standard browser's ability to render JSON responses.*

[@23F300327](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f300327)

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api  
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

```
# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

```

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.  
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:  
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues [TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *Here's the analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The image displays a prompt from a system (likely an autograder, a course platform, or a tool that integrates with GitHub) asking a user for their GitHub repository URL.
2.  **Expected Input Format:** The system explicitly states the expected format for the repository URL: `https://github.com/USER/REPO`.
3.  **User Provided Input:** The user has entered `https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git` as their repository URL.
4.  **Error Message:** Following the user's input, an error message "Error: No runs found" is displayed.
5.  **Implied Problem:** The error "No runs found" suggests that the system is attempting to look for GitHub Actions workflow runs (or similar automated processes) associated with the provided repository. The most probable cause for the error, given the input and the expected format, is the `.git` suffix in the user's URL (`actions.git` instead of just `actions`). While `.git` is common for cloning, GitHub web interfaces and many tools expect the base repository URL without it.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Prompt/Instruction:**
    ```
    What is your repository URL? It will look like: https://github.com/USER/REPO
    ```
*   **User-Provided URL (Input):**
    ```
    https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git

Im not able to get the ngrok question correct. I have attached a screenshot  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information:

The user is attempting to set up a local Llamafile server and expose it to the internet using `ngrok`. When they try to access the `ngrok` URL, they receive an error stating "Response is not valid JSON" followed by a full HTML error page.

**The core issue is that the `ngrok` tunnel is not directly serving the Llamafile application. Instead, it appears to be configured to route requests through a Cloudflare Worker, and that Cloudflare Worker is experiencing an exception.**

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **User Goal:** The user intends to download and run a `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile` model locally and then create a public tunnel to it using `ngrok`.
2.  **User Input/Context:** The user provides the `ngrok` URL they are trying to access: `https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app`.
3.  **Observed Error:** The client (browser/application making the request) expects a JSON response but receives an HTML document. This HTML document is a Cloudflare error page.
4.  **Cloudflare Error Details:**
    *   The page title is "Worker threw exception | exam.sanand.workers.dev | Cloudflare". This indicates the error originated from a Cloudflare Worker associated with the `exam.sanand.workers.dev` domain.
    *   The specific Cloudflare error code displayed is `1101`.
    *   The main error message is "Worker threw exception".
    *   The page explicitly states: "You've requested a page on a website (exam.sanand.workers.dev) that is on the Cloudflare network. An unknown error occurred while rendering the page."
    *   Crucially, it advises the website owner (likely the user posting) to "login to Cloudflare and check the error logs for exam.sanand.workers.dev".
5.  **Implication:** The `ngrok` tunnel is likely pointing to a Cloudflare Workers route or a domain configured on Cloudflare Workers (`exam.sanand.workers.dev`), and that Cloudflare Worker is failing to execute or reach its intended backend (which should be the Llamafile server). The problem is not with `ngrok` itself or the Llamafile server (directly), but with the Cloudflare Worker setup that `ngrok` is interfacing with.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   **Llamafile Model Name:**
    `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`
*   **Example ngrok URL format:**
    `https://[random].ngrok-free.app`
*   **User's ngrok URL:**
    `https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app`
*   **Initial Error Message:**
    `Error: Response is not valid JSON: <!DOCTYPE html> <!--[if IE 7]>`
*   **HTML Title Tag Content:**
    `<title>Worker threw exception | exam.sanand.workers.dev | Cloudflare</title>`
*   **Cloudflare Error Code:**
    `1101`
*   **Main Error Heading:**
    `<h2>Worker threw exception</h2>`
*   **Description of the problem:**
    `<p>You've requested a page on a website (exam.sanand.workers.dev) that is on the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/login?utm_source=error_100x" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> network. An unknown error occurred while rendering the page.</p>`
*   **Recommendation for owner:**
    `<strong>If you are the owner of this website:</strong><br>You should <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/login?utm_source=error_100x" target="_blank">login to Cloudflare</a> and check the error logs for exam.sanand.workers.dev`*

Hi Mishkat,

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.  
For example `https://tds21jan.vercel.app/`.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Vercel deployment dashboard for a project, showing a critical error and deployment details.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application Error:** The deployed application is currently displaying a "404: NOT_FOUND" error. This indicates that the server could not find the requested resource (e.g., the web page, the root file like `index.html`, or an API endpoint) at the given URL.
2.  **Deployment Status:**
    *   The deployment itself is marked as "Ready" with a green status indicator, suggesting that Vercel successfully built and served the project files. However, the 404 error implies an issue with the application's content or routing, not necessarily with Vercel's hosting capabilities.
    *   The deployment was created "18h ago by jivraj-18".
3.  **Deployment URLs/Domains:**
    *   The specific deployment URL is: `tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`
    *   The project also has a primary domain configured: `tds21jan.vercel.app`
    *   Another project domain is: `tds21jan-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app` (with a "+1" indicating at least one more domain is configured).
4.  **Source and Deployment Method:**
    *   There are options to "View code" (presumably linking to the Git repository).
    *   The deployment seems to have been triggered using the Vercel CLI, as indicated by `>_ vercel deploy`.
5.  **Call to Action:** The bottom section suggests connecting the project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to enable "Production Deployment" and likely continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) features. This implies the current deployment might be a manual or non-Git-linked deployment.

**Transcribed Error Messages, Codes, and Commands:**

*   **Error Message (prominent):** `404: NOT_FOUND`
*   **Error Code:** `Code: `NOT_FOUND``
*   **Error ID:** `ID: `sf01::xj47q-1737473362971-adc9c00e6fa8``
*   **Deployment Command (implied):** `>_ vercel deploy`*

Hi Gaurav,

This is problem with Cloudflare content delivery service where application is served. Try it out after some time it will work.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the Vercel dashboard for a project named `vercel-ga2`, likely part of a data science course assignment ("GA2 - Deployment Tools" is visible in an adjacent browser tab).

Here's the key information:

**1. Project & User Context:**
*   **Project Name:** `vercel-ga2`
*   **User Account:** `mishkat02` (visible in the URL and "Created by" timestamp).
*   **Vercel Path:** `mishkat02's projects / Hobby / vercel-ga2`
*   **Current Page:** Project Overview for `vercel-ga2`.
*   **Browser URL:** `vercel.com/mishkat02s-projects/vercel-ga2`

**2. Production Deployment Status & Problem:**
*   **Deployment Status:** The "Production Deployment" is marked as `Ready` (green dot). This indicates that the Vercel build and deployment process completed successfully.
*   **Core Problem:** Despite being `Ready`, the preview window on the left clearly shows a **404: NOT_FOUND** error when attempting to access the deployed application. This means the application itself is not serving content correctly at the root path, even though the deployment infrastructure is in place.
*   **Error Message (exactly as it appears):**
    ```
    404: NOT_FOUND
    Code: PAGE_NOT_FOUND
    ID: pdx1::f4yqj-1707409935708-d12952a735c0
    Read our documentation to learn more about this error.
    ```
*   **Deployment ID/URL:**
    *   Specific Deployment URL: `vercel-ga2-f7la455qq-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app`
    *   Primary Domain: `vercel-ga2.vercel.app` (with `+2` indicating two other associated domains).
*   **Deployment Age & Creator:** `22h ago by mishkat02`

**3. Deployment Method:**
*   The `Source` section indicates the deployment was initiated via a CLI command.
*   **Command:** `>_ vercel deploy`
*   The message "Connect your Project with a Git repository to create a Production Deployment" suggests this project is currently *not* linked to a Git repository for automatic deployments.

**4. Available Actions & Debugging Tools:**
*   **Top-level Actions:** `Connect Git`, `Usage`, `Domains`, `Visit` (dropdown).
*   **Deployment-specific Actions:** `Build Logs`, `Runtime Logs`, `Instant Rollback`. These are crucial for debugging the 404 error, as they would reveal issues during the build process or errors occurring when the application runs.
*   **Source Code:** `View code` link (presumably links to the repository or deployed code snapshot).

**5. Other Contextual Information:**
*   The presence of other browser tabs like "TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - D", "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - L", and "GA2 - Deployment Tools" confirms the user is likely working on academic assignments related to data science and deployment.
*   The Vercel interface is in dark mode.*

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow [Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to [this guide on DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k). I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

This image appears to be from a data science course or lab exercise, guiding a user through setting up and exposing a local language model.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Task Instructions:**
    *   The user is first instructed to **download "Llamafile"** and then **run a specific Llama model** (`Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`) using it. This implies Llamafile is an executable or a tool designed to run Llama models locally.
    *   The next step is to **create a public tunnel to the Llamafile server using "ngrok"**. This suggests the Llamafile is expected to run as a local server, and ngrok is used to make it accessible over the internet.
    *   Finally, the user is prompted to **provide the generated ngrok URL**, with an example format `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`.

2.  **User Input:**
    *   The user has submitted a URL in a text input field, which is highlighted with a red border and an exclamation mark icon, indicating an issue.

3.  **Error Message:**
    *   Below the input field, a red error message is displayed, indicating why the submitted URL was rejected.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Instructions (top block):**
    Download Llamafile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile model with it.

*   **Instructions (middle block):**
    Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok.

*   **Question/Prompt:**
    What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/

*   **User-submitted URL (in the input field):**
    `https://4d63-2409-40d0-100e-46d9-419e-d652-5b0e-f8fe.ngrok-free.app/`

*   **Error Message:**
    Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an online data science assignment or exam interface in a Chrome browser on macOS. The user is attempting to submit an ngrok URL as an answer and has received an error.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform/Context:**
    *   The URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2` indicates an exam or assignment hosted on a `workers.dev` domain, likely using Cloudflare Workers.
    *   It's a "The Data Science" (TDS) course or program, with a specific exam ID `2025-01-ga2`.
    *   The current score is **5.5 / 10**.
    *   The assignment is due on **Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST**.
    *   There are "Check" and "Save" buttons, suggesting an interactive submission system.

2.  **Assignment Task:**
    *   The task involves working with AI models:
        *   "Download **Llamafile**."
        *   "Run the **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile** model with it." (This specifies a particular LLM model.)
        *   "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using **ngrok**."
    *   The specific question for which input is required is: "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`"

3.  **User Input:**
    *   The user has entered the ngrok URL: `https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app`
    *   The input field has a red border and an exclamation mark icon, indicating an issue with the submission.

4.  **Error Message (Detailed Analysis Below):**
    *   The system first states: `Error: Response is not valid JSON:`
    *   Following this, it displays an HTML response from the server, indicating a `501 - Server does not support this operation` error, specifically mentioning an "Unsupported method ('POST')".

5.  **User Environment:**
    *   **Operating System:** macOS (indicated by the top menu bar, traffic light window controls, and the dock).
    *   **Browser:** Google Chrome (active window).
    *   **Date/Time:** Thu 23 Jan 4:12 PM.
    *   **Other Applications in Dock:** Finder, Safari, App Store, Maps, Mail (2 unread), Reminders, Notes, Google Chrome (active), Terminal, VS Code, Trash. The presence of Terminal and VS Code suggests the user is actively engaged in development or command-line tasks related to the assignment.

---

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Llamafile model name:**
    `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile`

*   **Example ngrok URL format (from instructions):**
    `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`

*   **User-provided ngrok URL:**
    `https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app`

*   **Full Error Message (exactly as it appears):**
    `Error: Response is not valid JSON: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"> <title>Error response</title> </head> <body> <h1>Error response</h1> <p>Error code: 501</p> <p>Message: Unsupported method ('POST').</p> <p>Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.</p> </body> </html>`

*   **Key parts of the server error within the HTML:**
    *   `Error code: 501`
    *   `Message: Unsupported method ('POST').`
    *   `Error code explanation: 501 - Server does not support this operation.`

---

**Summary of the Problem:**

The user has submitted an ngrok URL for an assignment. The assignment submission system expected a JSON response from the server it was interacting with (likely to validate the URL or check the status of the Llamafile server). However, the server responded with an HTML error page instead of JSON. The HTML error indicates an HTTP 501 "Not Implemented" status, specifically stating that the server does not support the 'POST' method that the submission system attempted to use. This suggests a mismatch in how the submission system is trying to interact with the backend service or an issue on the backend server itself not supporting the required HTTP method for the operation.*

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the ngrok error page screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays an `ngrok` error page, indicating that a public tunnel has been established to the `ngrok` agent, but the agent itself is unable to connect to the local web service it's supposed to expose.

1.  **URL:** The browser is attempting to access `https://1577-13-71-3-97.ngrok-free.app`. This is a standard `ngrok` public URL, confirming the user is trying to access a service via an `ngrok` tunnel.

2.  **Connection Flow Status:** A visual indicator at the top of the page clearly shows the connection breakdown:
    *   **Internet:** Green (OK)
    *   **ngrok Edge:** Green (OK)
    *   **ngrok Agent:** Green (OK)
    *   **Your Service:** Red 'X' (Failed)
    This directly points to the problem being between the `ngrok` agent and the user's local service, not an issue with the `ngrok` network or the agent itself receiving traffic.

3.  **Primary Error Message (Red Box):**
    *   **Error Code:** `ERR_NGROK_8012`
    *   **Description:** "Traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `undefined://localhost:52525`. The error encountered was:"
    *   **Target Address:** The `ngrok` agent is attempting to connect to `localhost` on port `52525`. The `undefined://` part of the protocol is unusual and might suggest an issue with how the `ngrok` tunnel was configured (e.g., missing or invalid protocol specified).

4.  **Specific Error Message (Transcribed):**
    ```
    dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused
    ```
    *   **Interpretation:** This is the critical piece of information.
        *   `dial tcp`: The `ngrok` agent attempted to open a TCP connection.
        *   `[::1]:52525`: It tried to connect to the IPv6 loopback address (`[::1]`, equivalent to `127.0.0.1` for IPv4) on port `52525`. This confirms the `ngrok` agent is trying to connect to a service running on the *same machine* where the agent is executing.
        *   `connect: connection refused`: This is the core problem. The operating system on the local machine actively refused the connection attempt. This typically means one of the following:
            *   No service is running and listening on port `52525` on that machine.
            *   A service *was* running but crashed or is no longer active.
            *   A firewall is explicitly blocking connections to that port, even from `localhost`.

5.  **Developer Guidance:** The page provides clear instructions for the developer:
    *   "On the machine where the ngrok agent is running, make sure a web service is running on `undefined://localhost:52525`."
    *   "Try to cURL or open the address in a browser to see that you get the correct response." This is a key diagnostic step.

6.  **Visitor Guidance:** Standard advice for visitors to wait and refresh, or contact the developer.

**In summary, the `ngrok` tunnel itself is functional up to the agent, but the local web service that the `ngrok` agent is supposed to expose is either not running, not listening on `localhost:52525`, or is actively refusing connections on that port.** The primary action for the user is to ensure their data science application or web service is correctly running and accessible on `localhost:52525` on the machine where they launched the `ngrok` agent.*

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search [Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It)](https://www.lifewire.com/error-524-a-timeout-occurred-4782741). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

Here is reference of error [ERR\_NGROK\_8012 | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_8012/)

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online data science or programming course forum, likely an assignment or challenge related to building a web API, specifically using FastAPI.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Task Description (API Requirements):**
    *   The API endpoint should handle a `class` query parameter.
    *   If `class` is present, it should return *only* students belonging to that class.
    *   Multiple `class` parameters (e.g., `?class=1A&class=1B`) should return students from all specified classes.
    *   Students should be returned in the order they appear in the source CSV file, not necessarily the order of the classes in the query.
    *   **Crucially**, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must be enabled for GET requests from any origin.

2.  **User Input / Provided Endpoint:**
    *   The user was asked to provide the API URL endpoint for FastAPI, with a hint that it might look like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
    *   The user has entered exactly `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.

3.  **Error Message and Expected Output:**
    *   The system has attempted to call the provided API endpoint and has encountered an error.
    *   The error is `Error: Response undefined does not match expected`.
    *   This implies that the API either did not respond at all, responded with an empty/invalid response, or the response could not be parsed as valid JSON by the testing system.
    *   The error message then provides the **exact expected JSON output** for this particular test case (which appears to be the base `/api` endpoint without any class filters, meaning it expects a full list of students).

4.  **Next Steps (Platform's Test Plan):**
    *   The platform indicates that after this initial test, it will send a request to the URL with `?class=...` added to verify the filtering functionality.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **URL Hint/Example:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **User-Entered URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **Error Message (exact):**
    ```
    Error: Response undefined does not match expected [[{"studentid":"67","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"86","class":"5T"},{"studentid":"91","class":"5T"},{"studentid":"187","class":"7B"},{"studentid":"217","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"221","class":"5T"},{"studentid":"408","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"471","class":"22"},{"studentid":"708","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"734","class":"5T"},{"studentid":"735","class":"22"},{"studentid":"928","class":"7B"},{"studentid":"1007","class":"5T"},{"studentid":"1029","class":"5T"},{"studentid":"1090","class":"7B"},{"studentid":"1106","class":"22"},{"studentid":"1154","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"1313","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"1354","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"1414","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"1422","class":"6X"},{"studentid":"1429","class":"22"},{"studentid":"1494","class":"7B"},{"studentid":"1994","class":"7B"}]]
    ```*



  
But when I run the url in my browser I got the following response  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser (Google Chrome) showing the JSON output from a local API endpoint, likely as part of a data science or web development course.

**Key Information:**

1.  **URL/Endpoint:** The browser is accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
    *   `127.0.0.1:8000` indicates a local development server running on port 8000.
    *   `/api` suggests a specific API endpoint.
    *   The URL includes query parameters: `?class=6X&class=ST&class=7B&class=2Z`. This means the API is being queried to retrieve student data associated with these four specific class identifiers.

2.  **API Response (Data Content):**
    *   The response is a JSON array (`[]`) containing multiple JSON objects (`{}`).
    *   Each object represents a student record, having two key-value pairs:
        *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing a unique student identifier.
        *   `"class"`: A string representing the class the student belongs to.
    *   The data includes students from the requested classes (`6X`, `ST`, `7B`).
    *   **Notable Discrepancy:** The response also includes a significant number of students from classes `"22"` and `"78"`. This is important because the URL requested classes `"2Z"` and `"7B"`. This could indicate:
        *   A mapping or translation occurring on the server side (e.g., `2Z` maps to `22`, `7B` maps to `78` or includes `78`).
        *   A potential typo in the request URL (`2Z` instead of `22`, `7B` instead of `78`) or an inconsistency in the backend data.
        *   The API might not be strictly filtering by the `class` parameters as expected, or it has a broader interpretation.
    *   The presence of a "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the browser or an extension is formatting the raw JSON for better readability.

3.  **Context for a Data Science Course:** This screenshot typically arises in lessons on:
    *   **API Interaction:** How to make requests to web APIs (e.g., using Python's `requests` library).
    *   **JSON Parsing:** How to parse and work with JSON data in Python (or R/Julia).
    *   **Data Retrieval:** Obtaining data from external sources.
    *   **Data Cleaning/Validation:** Recognizing and handling inconsistencies between requested parameters and returned data (like the class name discrepancies).
    *   **Local Server Setup:** Understanding how a data science application might serve data via a local API.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

**1. URL (Command/Request):**
```
127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=6X&class=ST&class=7B&class=2Z
```

**2. API Response (JSON Data):**
```json
[{"studentId":67,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":86,"class":"ST"},{"studentId":91,"class":"ST"},{"studentId":187,"class":"78"},{"studentId":217,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":221,"class":"ST"},{"studentId":468,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":471,"class":"22"},{"studentId":708,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":734,"class":"ST"},{"studentId":735,"class":"22"},{"studentId":928,"class":"78"},{"studentId":1007,"class":"ST"},{"studentId":1029,"class":"ST"},{"studentId":1080,"class":"7B"},{"studentId":1186,"class":"22"},{"studentId":1154,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":1313,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":1394,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":1414,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":1422,"class":"6X"},{"studentId":1429,"class":"22"},{"studentId":1494,"class":"78"},{"studentId":1994,"class":"78"}]
```
*(No explicit error messages are visible in the screenshot.)**



  
I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from direct running of url both are same. I don’t find any difference.  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) can you clarify where went wrong

Can any one help me to fix the following error in respect to answer to question 10  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course assignment or lab, focusing on setting up and accessing a local Large Language Model (LLM) server.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Task Description:** The user is instructed to perform the following steps:
    *   "Download Llamafile."
    *   "Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile model with it."
    *   "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."
    *   Finally, they need to submit the `ngrok` URL that points to their Llamafile server. An example format is provided: `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`.

2.  **User Input:** The user has entered `https://6eb1-27-7-78-14.ngrok-free.` into the input field. This field is highlighted with a red border, indicating an error.

3.  **Error Message:** Immediately below the input field, a red error message is displayed.

4.  **Interactive Elements:** There are two buttons at the bottom: "Check" (green) and "Save" (blue), suggesting that the entered URL is submitted for validation or storage when these buttons are clicked.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Model File Name:** `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`
*   **Example ngrok URL format:** `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`
*   **User-entered ngrok URL (in input field):** `https://6eb1-27-7-78-14.ngrok-free.`
*   **Error Message:** `Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 1016`

**Analysis:**

The user is attempting to submit the ngrok URL for their locally running Llamafile server. The error `Response is not valid JSON: error code: 1016` indicates that the backend system (likely the course platform's server) tried to process the submitted URL, but the response it received (perhaps from a validation endpoint or directly from attempting to access the URL) was not in the expected JSON format.

A critical observation is the difference between the provided example URL `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/` and the user's input `https://6eb1-27-7-78-14.ngrok-free.`. The user's URL is missing the `.app` domain suffix and the trailing `/` (though the trailing slash might be automatically added or optional). This missing `.app` is a very common mistake when using ngrok's free tier, as the generated URLs end in `.ngrok-free.app`.

Therefore, the likely cause of the error is that the URL submitted by the user is incomplete or incorrect, causing the course platform's validation service to either:
1.  Fail to reach a valid ngrok endpoint (e.g., getting a DNS error or a redirect).
2.  Reach an invalid or non-existent endpoint on ngrok, resulting in an HTML error page (like a 404 or 500) instead of the JSON response the validator expects.

The error code `1016` might be an internal code specific to the platform's API or a WebSocket close code (where 1016 indicates no reason given or abnormal closure). Given the context, it strongly suggests a failure in the communication or parsing of the response from the validation step.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an interaction on a data science course forum related to a GitHub Actions assignment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Context and Instructions:**
*   The assignment requires the user to create a GitHub Action on one of their repositories.
*   A crucial requirement for validation is that *one of the steps in the action must have a name that contains a specific email address*: `23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
*   An example YAML structure for the GitHub Action is provided.
*   After creating and configuring the action, the user must "Trigger the action and make sure it is the **most recent action**."
*   Finally, the user is asked to submit their "repository URL" which should look like `https://github.com/USER/REPO`.

**2. Provided Example GitHub Actions YAML:**

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        run: echo "Hello, world!"
```

*   This YAML defines a job named `test`.
*   Inside `test`, there's a single step.
*   The `name` of this step is exactly `23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, which matches the requirement.
*   The `run` command for this step is a simple shell command: `echo "Hello, world!"`.

**3. User Input and Error Message:**

*   **Repository URL Submitted:** `https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io`
*   **Error Message:** `Error: No step matches 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`

**4. Analysis of the Problem:**

The core issue is that the submitted repository URL is returning an error indicating that the required step name (`23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) was not found in the GitHub Action, despite the provided example YAML clearly showing this exact name.

Possible reasons for this error, based on the instructions and common GitHub Actions issues:

*   **User's Actual Workflow YAML Mismatch:** The user might not have deployed the *exact* YAML provided in the example to their `divya.github.io` repository. There could be a typo in the `name` field in their actual `.github/workflows/*.yml` file, or the step might be missing entirely, or the workflow file itself might not be correctly placed/configured in their repository.
*   **Action Not Triggered/Recent:** The instruction states "make sure it is the **most recent action**." If the user created the workflow but didn't trigger it, or if it was triggered but failed or was superseded by another action, the validation system might not find it or might be looking at an older, incorrect run.
*   **Workflow File Location/Syntax:** Though less likely given the specific error message, general GitHub Actions errors can occur if the workflow file is not in `.github/workflows/` or has YAML syntax issues that prevent GitHub from parsing it correctly.
*   **Validation Logic:** The validation system is likely checking the *name* of a step in the workflow run logs or the workflow definition itself to confirm compliance. The error indicates this specific match failed.*



  
can anyone please explain what’s the error and how to correct it ?

This section outlines a hands-on task:
*   **Task 1:** `Download Llamafile. Run the llama-3-2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile model with it.`
    *   This implies the user needs to set up and run a specific Llama 3 language model locally using `llamafile`.
*   **Task 2:** `Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok.`
    *   Users are required to expose their local `llamafile` server to the internet using the `ngrok` tunneling service.
*   **Submission/Input:** The question asks `What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`.
    *   The input field contains a previously entered or attempted URL: `https://0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app`.

**5. Error Message:**
The most critical part of the screenshot is the error message at the bottom:

```

```

*   **Primary Error Indication:** `Error: Response is not valid JSON:`
*   **Actual Response Content:** The content following the "invalid JSON" message is a full HTML document. This HTML is an `ngrok` error page.
*   **Specific Ngrok Error Message within HTML:**
    *   `Error` (header)
    *   `Tunnel 0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app not found (ERR_NGROK_3200)`
*   **Interpretation of Error:** The quiz platform likely made an API call to validate the `ngrok` URL submitted by the user. It expected a JSON response, but instead received an HTML error page directly from `ngrok`. This `ngrok` error page clearly states that the tunnel at `https://0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app` could not be found or is not active (indicated by `ERR_NGROK_3200`). This means the `ngrok` tunnel the user set up (or attempted to use) is either offline, was shut down, or the URL provided is incorrect/expired. The user needs to ensure their `ngrok` tunnel is running and correctly exposed.*

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

1. Open Squoosh and load the image
2. In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
3. The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user interface for an image optimization tool, likely a web application given its modern, clean design. It appears to be an "Edit" module focused on reducing image file size.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application Type:** An image editing or optimization utility, specifically designed for tasks like resizing, palette reduction, and compression.
2.  **Current Module:** The "Edit" section is active, with "Compress" being the currently highlighted and focused sub-section.
3.  **Available Operations (and their states):**
    *   **Resize:** A feature to change image dimensions. Its toggle switch is currently **off**.
    *   **Reduce palette:** A feature to decrease the number of distinct colors in the image (useful for optimizing certain image formats like PNG or GIF). Its toggle switch is currently **off**.
    *   **Compress:** This section offers detailed compression options.
        *   **Compression Method:** A dropdown menu is selected, showing **"OxiPNG"** as the chosen compression algorithm. OxiPNG is known for its advanced PNG optimization capabilities, often achieving significant file size reductions.
        *   **Interlace:** A checkbox option, currently **unchecked**. Interlacing allows an image to progressively display as it downloads.
        *   **Effort:** A slider control with a numerical value, currently set to **"2"**. This likely controls the intensity or quality of the compression, where higher numbers generally mean more compression but potentially longer processing times.
4.  **Optimization Results:**
    *   The tool indicates a **63% reduction** in file size has been achieved.
    *   The final optimized file size is **1.41 kB**. This is an extremely small file size, suggesting the original image was either very small or the optimization was highly effective.
5.  **Action Button:** A large blue circular button with a download icon (`⬇️`) is present, indicating the user can download the optimized image.
6.  **Navigation/Settings Icons:**
    *   In the top right, there are navigation arrows (`< >`, possibly for undo/redo or history) and two gear icons (`⚙️`, `⚙️`). These typically represent settings or configuration options.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no traditional code snippets, command-line entries, or error messages present in this UI screenshot. All visible text consists of UI labels, options, and status indicators.

*   **UI Labels:**
    *   `Edit`
    *   `Resize`
    *   `Reduce palette`
    *   `Compress`
    *   `OxiPNG` (within a dropdown)
    *   `Interlace`
    *   `Effort:`
    *   `%` (next to `↓63`)
    *   `kB` (next to `1.41`)

*   **Values/Statuses:**
    *   `↓63%`
    *   `1.41 kB`
    *   `2` (Effort level)*



I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user interface for an image editing or optimization tool, specifically focused on image compression.

**Key Information:**

*   **Header:** The interface is titled "Edit" and shows navigation arrows along with two gear/settings icons, suggesting navigation within an editing suite and access to general settings.
*   **Editing Options:**
    *   "Resize": A toggle switch, currently disabled (off).
    *   "Reduce palette": A toggle switch, currently disabled (off).
*   **Compression Section:** The "Compress" section is highlighted, indicating it's the active set of options.
    *   **Format:** The image is set to be compressed in the "WebP" format, selected via a dropdown menu.
    *   **Lossless:** The "Lossless" checkbox is checked, meaning the compression method aims to retain all original image data, preventing quality degradation.
    *   **Effort:** A slider controls the "Effort" level, currently set to "9". This likely dictates the intensity of the compression algorithm, with higher numbers usually indicating more compression but potentially longer processing times.
    *   **Slight loss:** Another slider for "Slight loss" is set to "0", indicating that no intentional quality reduction is being introduced beyond the lossless setting.
    *   **Additional Options:**
        *   "Discrete tone image": An unchecked checkbox, possibly for optimizing images with limited color palettes.
        *   "Preserve transparent data": An unchecked checkbox, which would typically be used to maintain an image's alpha channel (transparency).
*   **Compression Result:** At the bottom, the tool shows the result of the compression: "↓83%" reduction in file size, with the final size being "630 B" (Bytes).
*   **Action Button:** A large blue circular button with a download icon indicates that the compressed image can be downloaded.

**Transcription:**

Contineously showing this sir. Even the server is running on background  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information:

This screenshot displays a section of an online data science course that requires a user to interact with local services and expose them to the internet.

1.  **Context and Objective:** The user is being instructed to:
    *   Download and run a specific Llama model (`Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`) using `Llamafile`. This indicates a task involving local execution of a Large Language Model (LLM).
    *   Create a public tunnel to this local `Llamafile` server using `ngrok`. This is a common practice for exposing locally running development servers or services for testing or demonstration.

2.  **Task Requirement:** The course platform is asking the user to provide the `ngrok` URL generated for their Llamafile server. An example URL format (`https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`) is provided.

3.  **User Input:** The user has entered a URL into the input field, which appears to be a valid `ngrok-free.app` domain.

4.  **Observed Problem:** The input field and the area below it are highlighted in red, indicating an error has occurred upon submission or validation of the provided URL. There's an exclamation mark icon next to the URL, reinforcing the error state.

5.  **Specific Error Message:** Below the input field, an explicit error message is displayed, indicating the nature of the problem encountered by the course platform when trying to validate or connect to the provided URL.

6.  **Available Actions:** "Check" and "Save" buttons are present, suggesting the user attempted to validate their input using "Check."

Error is  
TypeError: Failed to fetch



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online forum or interactive lesson in a data science course, likely focused on building web APIs with FastAPI. It outlines requirements for an API endpoint and shows an attempt by the user to provide the endpoint, which resulted in an error.

Here's the key information:

**1. API Requirements/Problem Statement:**
*   The API endpoint should handle a query parameter named `class`.
*   If `class` is present, it should return students only from the specified classes.
*   **Examples provided:**
    *   `/api?class=1A` should return students from class 1A.
    *   `/api?class=1A&class=1B` should return students from class 1A and 1B.
*   The API must support any number of `class` query parameters.
*   Students should be returned in the order they appear in the CSV file, not the order of the classes specified in the query.
*   **Crucial requirement:** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must be enabled to allow GET requests from any origin.

**2. User Input / Prompt:**
*   The system is asking the user to provide the API URL endpoint for their FastAPI application.
*   An example format is given: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

**3. User Action & Error Message:**
*   The user has entered text into an input field (mostly obscured by a blue blur) which starts with `h`. This suggests they attempted to enter an `http` or `https` URL.
*   The input field has a red border and an exclamation mark icon, indicating an issue with the entered value or the subsequent operation.
*   **Error Message (transcribed exactly):**
    ```
    TypeError: Failed to fetch
    ```

**4. System's Next Steps:**
*   Once a valid and accessible URL is provided, the system will test it by sending a request with `?class=...` query parameters to verify if the response matches the expected data.

**Analysis of the Error:**
The `TypeError: Failed to fetch` is a client-side JavaScript error (typically from a browser's `fetch` API) that indicates a network request could not be completed. Common reasons include:
*   The server (FastAPI application) is not running at the specified URL.
*   The URL provided by the user is incorrect or unreachable.
*   A CORS policy issue is preventing the browser from even initiating the request (e.g., preflight request denied), even though the requirement explicitly states CORS should be enabled. This error can occur before the server even receives the request if the browser's security policies block it.
*   Network issues (e.g., no internet connection, firewall blocking).*



I’m leaving the url running, you can see you get a dummy response(clicking the link), how should i go about it. I’d prefer to use codespaces. Please help me

No problems, I got it , SOLUTION just made the port public

for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a set of instructions or a prompt from what appears to be a data science course or lab exercise, likely related to setting up and interacting with local AI models.

**Key Information and Instructions:**

1.  **Download and Run Model:** Users are first instructed to "Download Llamatile" which is an underlined hyperlink, suggesting it's a specific tool or file type. Following this, they are told to "Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile model with it." This indicates that `Llamafile` is an executable or framework used to run the specified Large Language Model (LLM) file.
2.  **Create Ngrok Tunnel:** The next step involves networking: "Create a tunnel to the Llamatile server using ngrok." This implies that running the `Llamafile` model starts a local server, and `ngrok` (also an underlined hyperlink, suggesting it's a tool) is to be used to create a public tunnel to that local server.
3.  **Identify Ngrok URL:** The primary question or task for the user is "What is the ngrok URL?" An example format is provided for guidance: "It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/".

**User Input and Status:**

*   Below the prompt, there is an input field containing text that has been deliberately obscured (blacked out). Visible underneath the blacked-out area is a yellow/light green highlight, suggesting the text was successfully entered or is the correct answer.
*   Immediately below the input field, the word "Correct" is displayed in green text, confirming that the user's provided `ngrok` URL was accurate.

**Transcribed Text (Code, Commands, or Error Messages):**

*   `Download Llamatile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile model with it.`
*   `Create a tunnel to the Llamatile server using ngrok.`
*   `What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`
*   `Correct`*

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

[

> **Image Content:** *This image is a thumbnail for an educational video, likely part of a data science or IT fundamentals course, focused on network ports. It is titled "PORTS EXPLAINED ANIMATED," indicating a visual and dynamic approach to teaching the subject.

Here's the key information and exact transcription:

**Overall Theme:**
The image is a visually rich graphic designed to introduce the concept of network ports, protocols, and server monitoring. It combines illustrative elements with tabular data.

**Key Visual Elements & Information:**

1.  **Main Title:**
    *   Large white text: `PORTS`
    *   Large green text: `EXPLAINED`
    *   Large green text at the bottom: `ANIMATED`

2.  **Left Side - Computer Workstation:**
    *   A stylized computer monitor with a bright green screen (suggesting active display or data flow).
    *   Below the monitor, a device labeled `POWERCERT` (possibly a branding for the course/creator) resembling a set-top box or a small form-factor PC. It has several indicator lights and buttons.

3.  **Center - Port List Table:**
    This table lists common network protocols and their standard port numbers. It is divided into two logical sections.

    **First Section:**
    | DESCRIPTION | PORT NUMBER |
    | :---------- | :---------- |
    | FTP         | 21          |
    | SSH         | 22          |

    | SGMP        | 153         |
    | SNMP        | 161         |
    | BGMP        | 264         |
    | LDAP        | 389         |
    | UPS         | 401         |
    | SLP         | 427         |
    | HTTPS       | 443         |
    | RPC         | 530         |
    | RDP         | 3389        |

4.  **Right Side - Server Rack/Monitoring System:**
    This section depicts a multi-unit server rack with various status displays, often seen in network operations centers (NOCs) or data centers. The branding `POWERCERT` appears at the top.

    *   **Unit 1 (Top):** Grid of multi-colored indicator lights (red, green, blue, yellow, orange), suggesting network activity or status.
    *   **Unit 2:**
        *   Text: `255.255.0.0` (appears twice, likely representing subnet masks or IP range indicators).
        *   Text: `I.P. ADDRESS`
        *   Numbers/Indicators: `9728 8025 8025 8025` (on the left) and `5728 8025 8025 8025` (on the right). These could represent port traffic, connection counts, or generic status.
    *   **Unit 3:**
        *   Repeated text: `LAND` (multiple times).
        *   IP addresses and domain: `HOMES.COM 10.0.0.99.22` (appears multiple times, suggesting specific network endpoints or services).
    *   **Unit 4:** A series of green bar graphs and squares, indicating activity or resource utilization.
    *   **Unit 5 (Central Display):**
        *   Text: `8025 - 5728`
        *   Large green text: `SERVER`
        *   Smaller text: `LAND` (multiple times)
        *   Numbers/Indicators: `8025` (multiple times).
    *   **Unit 6 (Monitoring):**
        *   Two rotating green fan icons with `FAN RPM` text.
        *   Temperature reading: `TEMP` `148°`
        *   Battery/Power indicators: Multiple green bars.
        *   Text: `LAND` (multiple times).
        *   Numbers: `8025` (multiple times).
    *   **Unit 7:** Green graphical icons resembling data flow or storage indicators (arrows, stacked cylinders).
    *   **Unit 8:** More green activity indicators.
    *   **Unit 9 (Bottom):**
        *   A globe icon.
        *   Numbers: `8025 8025 8025 1280::.`
        *   Numerical rows:
            *   `1482 1482 1482 1482`
            *   `2785 2785 2785 2785`
        *   Button: `SAP` (could refer to "System Application Program" or a generic software button).

**No specific code, commands, or error messages are present beyond the displayed server metrics and protocol names.** The numbers `8025`, `5728`, and the IP `10.0.0.99.22` appear frequently and likely serve as illustrative examples rather than actual live data or specific commands.*

> **Image Content:** *This image appears to be a thumbnail or illustrative graphic for a learning module or forum discussion topic titled **"FIREWALL EXPLAINED"**. While not a direct screenshot of a forum post itself, it's clearly designed to convey a key concept in cybersecurity, which is highly relevant in data science contexts (e.g., data security, network infrastructure, MLOps security).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

*   **Topic:** The central theme is an explanation of "FIREWALLs" and their function.
*   **Visual Metaphor:** A red brick wall, clearly labeled "FIREWALL" vertically on its side, serves as a strong visual metaphor for a protective barrier.
*   **Threat Representation:** Three orange skull and crossbones symbols (universally recognized as a sign of danger, poison, or malware) are shown attempting to pass through the firewall but are visibly blocked, bouncing off it. This illustrates the firewall's role in preventing malicious entities.
*   **Attacker:** A stylized, anonymous figure in a black trench coat and fedora is labeled "HACKER" in red text on their chest. This figure represents the source of the malicious activity.
*   **Target/System:** A laptop computer is depicted on the left, with its screen reflecting the "hacker" figure. This signifies the system or network that the firewall is protecting.
*   **Educational Context:** The title "FIREWALL EXPLAINED" strongly suggests this is an educational resource aimed at clarifying the concept of firewalls.
*   **Color Scheme:** The background transitions from blue (top) to green (bottom), providing a vibrant backdrop. The red firewall, orange skulls, and black hacker create high contrast and emphasize the elements.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Main Title:**
    FIREWALL
    EXPLAINED
*   **Text on Firewall:**
    FIREWALL (oriented vertically along the right side of the wall)
*   **Text on Hacker Figure:**
    HACKER
*   **Code/Commands/Error Messages:**
    There are no discernible, real code, commands, or error messages. The laptop screen displays what appears to be **garbled text or binary code**, likely placeholder content to represent data or system activity. It's not legible enough to transcribe character by character beyond recognizing it as repeating patterns of small, light-colored blocks and lines of indistinct characters, possibly representing `010101` or similar binary data.*

[

> **Image Content:** *This image is a title slide or thumbnail for an educational resource, likely a video or animated presentation, designed to explain and compare **Virtual Machines (VMs)** and **Containers**. It visually contrasts the architecture and resource allocation of these two virtualization technologies.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Main Topic:** The central, large white text clearly states "VMS vs CONTAINERS," indicating the primary subject of the content is a comparison between these two technologies.
2.  **Presentation Format:** The word "ANIMATED" at the bottom suggests that the resource is dynamic, likely a video or interactive demonstration, rather than a static document.
3.  **Virtual Machines (Left Side):**
    *   **Visual Representation:** Multiple identical server racks are depicted. Each rack represents a host server, and within each, distinct sections are labeled "VIRTUAL MACHINES."
    *   **VM Components:** Inside each virtual machine, there are separate logical units labeled "EMAIL," "WEBSERVER," and "DATABASE."
    *   **Operating Systems:** Next to these components, small icons and text indicate different operating systems running within each VM: "WINDOWS," "LINUX," and "UNIX." This highlights that VMs typically encapsulate an entire OS along with the application.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Each VM section includes various green bar graphs and gauges, likely representing CPU, RAM, DISK, and LAN usage, indicating that resources are allocated and monitored per VM.
    *   **User Interface:** A separate desktop monitor with a keyboard is shown below the VM racks, displaying what appears to be a Windows desktop environment, reinforcing the concept of a full, isolated operating system for each VM.
4.  **Containers (Right Side):**
    *   **Visual Representation:** A single, large server rack, labeled "POWERCERT" at the top, is shown. This implies a shared host environment for multiple containers.
    *   **Status Indicators:** Below "POWERCERT," there's a panel with numerous multicolored (red, green, blue, yellow, orange) circular lights, possibly indicating the status or activity of services.
    *   **Container Components:** Within the single server rack, multiple distinct green boxes are explicitly labeled "CONTAINERS." Each container box is further labeled "APPLICATION," emphasizing that containers package only the application and its dependencies, sharing the host OS kernel.
    *   **Application Monitoring:** Inside each "APPLICATION" box, there are small graphical representations and numerical values (e.g., "5.12B," "02S," "0.015"), suggesting monitoring of application performance metrics rather than full OS resources.
    *   **Overall Label:** The bottom of the large server rack also reiterates "CONTAINERS."
5.  **Branding:** The name "POWERCERT" appears at the top of the container server rack and on the desktop monitor, likely indicating the creator or platform providing the content.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are no code, commands, or error messages visible in the screenshot. All visible text is descriptive labeling.*

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?

### Post #93 by **Carlton D'Silva** (Regular, ds-students)

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

hi [@23f2003853](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2003853)

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

### Key Information:

The screenshot displays a user interface from a data science course, likely an assignment or a platform validating a student's work.

1.  **CORS Requirement:** The first line provides a crucial hint: "Make sure you enable **CORS** to allow GET requests from any origin." This indicates that the user is deploying a web application or API, and proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration is essential for it to function correctly and be accessible from different origins (e.g., a frontend application running on a different domain).
2.  **Vercel URL Prompt:** The system is asking the user to provide their Vercel API URL, giving an example format: "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api". Vercel is a popular platform for deploying frontend applications and serverless functions.
3.  **User Input:** The user has entered `https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api` into the input field. This URL follows the suggested format, implying that the user has successfully deployed an application or API on Vercel.
4.  **Error Message:** Below the input field, a red error message indicates a problem with the submitted URL. The error, "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]", is highly technical.
    *   The numbers likely represent ASCII or byte values. Let's interpret them:
        *   `73` = 'I'
        *   `53` = '5'
        *   `61` = '='
        *   `63` = '?'
    *   The error essentially means the system expected a specific sequence of these values but received a different permutation or order of them. For example, if we map the numbers to characters, the system expected `[I, I, 5, ?, =]` but received `[I, 5, =, ?, I]`.
    *   This kind of error usually implies that a generated identifier, a checksum, a hash, or some internal representation derived from the user's Vercel deployment or its configuration does not match what the checker expects. It's not a syntax error in the URL itself, but a mismatch in a processed value associated with it. This could stem from:
        *   A subtle configuration error in the Vercel project or the deployed API.
        *   An unexpected value being returned by the API when the checker tries to access it.
        *   An issue with how the system processes or compares the user-provided URL or its derived properties.

In summary, the user has likely deployed an API on Vercel and provided its URL, but an underlying configuration or response from their deployed API (possibly related to a unique ID or specific string the checker is looking for) does not match the expected sequence of values, leading to the cryptic numerical error. The CORS reminder at the top is also a critical part of the setup that needs to be correctly handled.

### Transcriptions:

Make sure you enable **CORS** to allow GET requests from any origin.

What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api

https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel, just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays Python code, likely from a data science course or a forum discussing serverless functions/web APIs, given the `q-vercel-python.json` filename reference. The code implements a basic HTTP request handler, extending `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`, to serve data over HTTP.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The `handler` class is designed to act as a simple web endpoint that retrieves "marks" associated with specified "names" from a local JSON file. It supports both GET and OPTIONS HTTP methods.
*   **CORS Support:** The code explicitly sets Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`) to allow requests from any origin (`*`) for GET and OPTIONS methods, indicating it's intended to be accessed by web applications.
*   **Data Source:** It loads its data from a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`, located one directory up from where the script is executed. The path resolution uses `os.path.abspath(__file__)` to ensure robustness.
*   **GET Request (`do_GET`):**
    *   Sets appropriate HTTP status (200 OK) and content type (`application/json`).
    *   Parses the query string of the request URL to extract values for the `name` parameter.
    *   **Error Handling (Missing Parameter):** If no `name` query parameter is provided, it returns a JSON error message.
    *   **Data Retrieval Logic:** It iterates through the loaded JSON data. For each `entry` in the data, if the `entry['name']` matches any of the requested `names` (from the query parameter), it appends `entry['marks']` to a `marks` list.
    *   **Response Logic:**
        *   If `marks` are found, it returns a JSON object `{"marks": [...]}` containing the collected marks.
        *   If no marks are found (i.e., the `marks` list remains empty), it returns a JSON error message `{"error": "Name not found"}`.
*   **OPTIONS Request (`do_OPTIONS`):**
    *   Handles HTTP OPTIONS preflight requests, essential for CORS, by setting the appropriate CORS headers and returning a 200 OK status.
*   **Libraries Used:** `json` for JSON serialization/deserialization, `os` for path manipulation, `http.server` for the HTTP server functionality, and `urllib.parse` for parsing URLs and query strings.

**Code Transcription:**

```python
import json
import os
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from urllib.parse import parse_qs, urlparse

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def do_GET(self):
        # Set CORS headers to allow requests from any origin
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, OPTIONS')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
        self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/json')

        # Load the JSON data
        dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        json_file_path = os.path.join(dir_path, "../q-vercel-python.json")
        with open(json_file_path, "r") as file:
            data = json.load(file)

        # Parse query parameters
        query_components = parse_qs(urlparse(self.path).query)
        names = query_components.get('name', [])

        if not names:
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"error": "Please provide a 'name' query parameter"}).encode('utf-8'))
            return

        # Collect the marks for provided names
        marks = []
        for entry in data:
            if entry['name'] in names:
                marks.append(entry['marks'])

        self.end_headers()

        if marks:
            response = {"marks": (marks)}
        else:
            response = {"error": "Name not found"}

        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response).encode('utf-8'))

    def do_OPTIONS(self):
        # Handle preflight requests for CORS
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, OPTIONS')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
        self.end_headers()
```*



  
Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?

Till yesterday I was able to login ngrok. But today it shows some error  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot depicts a user attempting to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for their ngrok account and encountering an error.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application/Service:** The user is on the ngrok dashboard, specifically on the MFA setup page (`dashboard.ngrok.com/login/mfa/setup`). Ngrok is a popular tool often used in data science and web development to expose local servers to the internet.
2.  **User Action:** The user is trying to activate a device for MFA by entering a code. The form prompts "Enter the code displayed on your device." This implies the user is likely using an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) on another device to generate this code.
3.  **Input Provided:** A long alphanumeric code has been entered into the text field.
4.  **Problem/Error:** An error message is displayed, indicating that the code provided for MFA verification is incorrect or invalid.
5.  **MFA Context:** The presence of "Back to QR Code" suggests that the user might have previously seen a QR code for MFA setup (which is common for authenticator apps) and perhaps opted for manual entry or is revisiting the setup.
6.  **Security Notice:** A small note below the "Back to QR Code" link states, "ngrok staff will never ask you to enter a code on this page," which is a standard security reminder to prevent phishing.
7.  **Browser Context:** The user is using Google Chrome, with several tabs open, including "Copy of week3...", "My Dashboard", "Graded Assignm...", "ngrok - Online i...", "Introducing Cha...", and "Token Count Va...". This suggests the user is likely a student or participant in a data science or programming course, possibly using ngrok as part of an assignment or project.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Input Code (as seen in the text field):**
    `4VZTALOCF43MBSGDR63ZL7THHK4BO6I3`

*   **Error Message:**
    *   **Title:** `Error`
    *   **Body:** `The information supplied for MFA verification was invalid.`*



  
can anyone guide me to fix it

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a set of instructions and a question from what appears to be a step-by-step lab or assignment in a data science course, likely related to deploying or accessing a language model locally.

1.  **Task 1: Model Setup:** The user is instructed to download "Llamalife" and then use it to run a specific Large Language Model (LLM) file named "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile". This indicates a task involving local LLM inference or serving.
2.  **Task 2: Server Tunneling:** The next step requires creating a public tunnel to the "Llamalife server" using `ngrok`. This is a common technique to expose a local server to the internet, often used in development or for sharing local applications.
3.  **Question & Expected Input:** The user is prompted to provide the `ngrok` URL generated. An example format is provided (`https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`), indicating the structure of the expected answer.
4.  **User's Entered URL & Status:** The bottom section shows a URL entered by the user. It is contained within a red-bordered box with a red exclamation mark icon on the right, which typically signifies an error, incorrect input, or a validation failure in a forum or quiz environment. This suggests that the provided URL, despite looking like a valid `ngrok-free.app` URL, was not accepted for some reason.

**Transcribed Text:**

*   **Instructions/Questions:**
    Download Llamalife. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile model with it.
    Create a tunnel to the Llamalife server using ngrok.
    What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Sir I am getting this “TypeError: Load failed” for Q9 inspite of getting proper responses in “<http://127.0.0.1:8000/api>”, cors is also enabled. Please help me with this, I am finding it difficult to circumvent this.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot comes from a data science course forum or interactive lesson, focusing on testing an API, likely built with FastAPI.

**Key Information:**

*   **Objective:** The user is prompted to provide the API URL endpoint for a FastAPI application.
*   **Prerequisite/Hint 1:** The course material explicitly states, "Make sure you enable **CORS** to allow GET requests from any origin." This highlights a common issue in web development where cross-origin requests are blocked by default for security reasons unless the server (FastAPI in this case) is configured to allow them. This is a strong hint for potential troubleshooting.
*   **Suggested URL Format:** An example URL is provided: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This indicates the expected structure, typically a local development server on port 8000 with an `/api` base path.
*   **User Input:** The user has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` into the input field. This exactly matches the suggested format.
*   **Error Indication:** The input field is highlighted with a red border and a red exclamation mark icon, indicating an error with the provided input or a failed test.
*   **Testing Methodology:** The system will attempt to validate the URL by sending a request to it, specifically appending a query parameter like `?class=...`, and then checking if the response data matches expectations. This implies the API is expected to handle GET requests with query parameters.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **User-provided/Suggested URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **Error Message:** `TypeError: Load failed`
*   **Query Parameter for Testing (partially visible):** `?class=...`*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser window, likely Google Chrome, operating in dark mode. It shows the output of what appears to be a local web server or API, common in data science and web development learning environments.

**Key Information:**

*   **Environment:** A web browser window (indicated by the traffic light controls, navigation arrows, Google icon, and tab structure) displaying content served from a local address.
*   **Local Host:** The URL bar prominently shows `127.0.0.1`, which is the loopback address (localhost). This indicates that the content being displayed is originating from a server or application running directly on the user's machine, rather than a remote website.
*   **Browser Tabs:** Two other tabs are visible, suggesting the user is engaged with course material:
    *   `Tools in Data Sc...` (likely "Tools in Data Science")
    *   `TDS 2025 Jan G...` (likely "TDS 2025 January Group" or similar, reinforcing the data science course context).
*   **Data Format:** The primary content displayed is data formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This is a common and widely used format for data interchange, especially in web APIs.
*   **Data Content:** The JSON structure represents a collection of student records. It contains a top-level object with a single key, `"students"`, whose value is an array of objects. Each object in the array represents an individual student and has two key-value pairs:
    *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing a unique student identifier.
    *   `"class"`: A string value, which is consistently `"1A"` for all visible student records.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

**URL/Command:**
`127.0.0.1`

**JSON Data:**
```json
{"students":[{"studentId":34,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":453,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":551,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":829,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":1309,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":1795,"class":"1A"}]}

### Post #103 by **SAKSHI PATHAK** (ds-students)
*January 29, 2025, 21:24 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online data science course forum, likely an assignment or coding challenge, where a user has submitted a solution for a Vercel-deployed Python API. The current score is 8 out of 10, indicating partial success.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assignment Instructions:**

*   **Data Source:** The user is instructed to download a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`. This file contains the "marks of 100 imaginary students."
*   **Task:**
    *   Create and deploy a Python application to Vercel.
    *   Expose an API endpoint at a path like `/api`.
    *   The API should respond to GET requests with specific query parameters for student names.
    *   **Example Request Format:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` (where X and Y are student names).
    *   **Expected JSON Response Format:** The API should return a JSON object with a single key "marks" whose value is an array containing the marks of the requested students (X and Y).
        ```json
        { "marks": [10, 20] }
        ```
*   **CORS Requirement:** The API must enable **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin. This is crucial for web applications interacting with the API from different domains.
*   **Submission Format:** The user is asked to provide the base Vercel URL for their API, following the format `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.

**2. User Submission and Error Message:**

*   **Submitted URL:**
    ```
    https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api
    ```
    This URL adheres to the expected format.
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Error: Expected [35,71,83,96,95] but got [null,null,null,null,null]
    ```

**Analysis of the Error:**

The error message indicates that the automated grading system made a request to the user's deployed API and compared the returned data with an expected result.

*   **`Expected [35,71,83,96,95]`**: This is the list of numerical marks that the grading system anticipated receiving from the user's API for a specific set of student names (which are not explicitly shown in the query parameters of the error message, but are implied).
*   **`but got [null,null,null,null,null]`**: This is what the user's API actually returned. The presence of `null` values within the array strongly suggests that:
    *   The API successfully parsed the request and identified that it needed to return a list of marks.
    *   However, for the specific student names queried by the grading system, the API either could not find the corresponding marks in the `q-vercel-python.json` data, or its logic for retrieving/processing those marks resulted in `null` instead of the actual numerical values.

**Potential Causes for the Error:**

*   **Incorrect data parsing:** The `q-vercel-python.json` file might not be correctly loaded or parsed within the Python application.
*   **Flawed lookup logic:** The code that extracts marks based on the `name=X` query parameters might be faulty. It might not correctly map student names to their marks, or handle cases where names are not found (returning `null` instead of raising an error or returning an empty list if not required).
*   **Case sensitivity/typos:** The student names being queried by the grading system might have different casing or slight variations compared to how they are stored in the JSON file, leading to mismatches.
*   **Incorrect handling of multiple `name` parameters:** The API might not be correctly processing multiple `name` query parameters (e.g., `name=X&name=Y`) to extract all requested student names. It might only be picking up the last `name` parameter or none correctly.*



Please anyone who have done these kindly guide me. As in Q6 i am unable to fetch values it is giving null all time.  
and in Q9 how can I use class as variable name ?

    *   `PIL` (Pillow, specifically `Image`): For opening and handling image files.
    *   `google.colab.files`: For enabling file uploads within the Colab environment.
    *   `colorsys`: For color system conversions, specifically converting RGB to HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation).
5.  **Core Task:** The code processes an uploaded image to determine the number of "light" pixels based on a specific lightness threshold in the HLS color space.
6.  **Steps Involved:**
    *   **File Upload:** The user is prompted to upload an image file using `files.upload()`.
    *   **Image Loading:** The first uploaded file (identified by `list(uploaded.keys())[0]`) is opened as a PIL `Image` object.
    *   **RGB Normalization:** The image is converted into a NumPy array, and its RGB pixel values (ranging 0-255) are normalized to 0.0-1.0 by dividing by 255.0.
    *   **Lightness Extraction:** For each pixel's RGB triplet, the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function is applied. The lightness component (index `[1]` of the HLS tuple) is extracted. This is done efficiently across the image array using `np.apply_along_axis` on the color channel axis (`axis=2`).
    *   **Pixel Counting:** The code counts how many pixels have a lightness value greater than or equal to `0.219`.
    *   **Result Output:** The final count of "light pixels" is printed to the console.
7.  **Specific File Processed:** The user uploaded a file named `lenna.webp`.
8.  **File Upload Details:** The `lenna.webp` file is an `image/webp` type, 14820 bytes in size, and was last modified on `1/30/2025`. It successfully uploaded and was saved as `lenna (1).webp` (Colab often renames files if a duplicate name exists).
9.  **Calculated Result:** There are `248985` pixels in the `lenna.webp` image that have a lightness value greater than or equal to `0.219`.

## Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

**Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

uploaded = files.upload()
image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0

*January 30, 2025, 08:07 UTC*
this is my code  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python code cell from a Google Colab environment, demonstrating image processing to count pixels based on their lightness value.

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** Google Colaboratory (indicated by `from google.colab import files`).
2.  **Code Purpose:** The Python script is designed to:
    *   Allow the user to upload an image file.
    *   Read the uploaded image using the PIL (Pillow) library.
    *   Convert the image's RGB pixel values to the HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) color space.
    *   Identify and count the number of pixels whose "lightness" component meets or exceeds a specified threshold (0.219 in this case).
3.  **Libraries Used:**
    *   `numpy` (as `np`): For numerical operations, especially array manipulation (e.g., converting image to array, applying functions along axes, summing boolean arrays).
    *   `PIL` (Pillow) `Image`: For opening and handling image files.
    *   `google.colab.files`: For handling file uploads in the Colab environment.
    *   `colorsys`: For converting between different color systems (specifically RGB to HLS).
4.  **Input:** An image file named `lenna.webp`.
5.  **Output:** The script successfully executed and reported "248985" pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219.
6.  **Execution Status:** The code cell executed successfully, taking 8 seconds (`✓ 8s`).
7.  **File Details:** The uploaded `lenna.webp` file is an `image/webp` type, 14820 bytes in size, and was last modified on `1/30/2025`. It was uploaded and saved, with Colab indicating "100% done" for the upload and then "Saving lenna.webp to lenna (1).webp".

### Code, Commands, and Output Transcriptions:

**Code:**

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

uploaded=files.upload()
image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness >= 0.219)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')
```

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.  
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook, demonstrating a Python script for image processing, specifically analyzing the lightness of an uploaded image.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The code is being run in a Google Colab environment, indicated by `from google.colab import files` and the interactive "Choose Files" button in the output.
2.  **Libraries Used:**
    *   `numpy` (as `np`): For numerical operations, especially array manipulation.
    *   `PIL` (Pillow): For image opening and manipulation.
    *   `google.colab.files`: For handling file uploads within the Colab environment.
    *   `colorsys`: For converting color values between different color systems (e.g., RGB to HLS).
3.  **Objective:** The script uploads an image, converts its RGB pixel values to HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation), and then counts how many pixels have a lightness value greater than a specified threshold (0.219).
4.  **Workflow:**
    *   The user is prompted to upload a file using `files.upload()`.
    *   The uploaded file's name (`lenna.webp`) is automatically retrieved, and the image is opened using `PIL.Image.open()`.
    *   The image is converted into a NumPy array (`rgb`) and its pixel values are normalized from the 0-255 range to 0.0-1.0.
    *   `np.apply_along_axis` is used to iterate through each pixel's RGB values and convert them to HLS using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`. The lightness component (index `[1]` of the HLS tuple) is extracted.
    *   A boolean array is created where `True` indicates pixels with lightness greater than 0.219.
    *   `np.sum()` counts the number of `True` values in this boolean array, giving the `light_pixels` count.
    *   Finally, the count of light pixels is printed.
5.  **Input/Output:**
    *   **Input:** The script expects an image file to be uploaded. In this instance, `lenna.webp` was uploaded.
    *   **Output:** The script successfully identifies `248985` pixels in the `lenna.webp` image that have a lightness value greater than 0.219.

**Code, Commands, and Error Messages Transcription:**

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

uploaded = files.upload()
image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.219)

print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')
```

**Output from the cell execution:**

```

### Post #113 by **23F3002987 J SRI BALAJI PRABHU** (ds-students)
*January 30, 2025, 16:03 UTC*
For Graded Assignment 2 Q6, I’m getting the right answer but in portal it throws an error.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a web browser window, likely showing the result of an API call made by a student or instructor as part of a data science course.

1.  **Course Context:** The browser tabs indicate the context:
    *   "IIT Madras" (likely the institution).
    *   "Graded Assig" (suggests a graded assignment).
    *   "TDS 2025 Jan" (possibly "Topics in Data Science" or a similar course, indicating a January 2025 semester or cohort).
    *   "GA2 - Deplo" (appears twice, likely referring to "Graded Assignment 2 - Deployment"), strongly indicating that the task involves deploying a web application or API.
    *   "Pyth" (likely Python), indicating the programming language used for the course or the deployed application.

2.  **API Interaction:** The main content shows the response from a web API endpoint.

3.  **URL and API Endpoint:** The URL in the address bar is for a deployed application, specifically an API:
    *   It's hosted on `vercel.app`, a popular platform for front-end and serverless function deployments.
    *   The sub-domain `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33` suggests a project named "sri-balajis-projects" deployed via Vercel.
    *   The path `/api` indicates an API endpoint.
    *   A query parameter `name="dzPtdczl9"` is being passed, likely an identifier or input to the API to retrieve specific data.

4.  **API Response:** The API returns a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object:
    *   `{"marks":[65]}`
    *   This JSON structure indicates that the API is returning a list of "marks" (scores or grades), and in this specific case, the value is `65`. This strongly suggests the API is designed to retrieve grades or performance data for a given input (in this case, the `name` parameter).

5.  **Browser Feature:** The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the user is viewing a raw JSON response in a browser's developer tools or a similar JSON viewer, which offers formatting for readability.

**In summary, the image shows a successful API call to a deployed application (likely part of a 'Graded Assignment 2 - Deployment' from an IIT Madras 'TDS' course), which returns a JSON object containing a 'marks' value of 65 for a specific identifier.**

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **URL:**
    `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api?name="dzPtdczl9"`

*   **User Interface Text:**
    `Pretty-print`

*   **API Response (JSON):**
    `{"marks":[65]}`*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a task description and a user's attempt within a data science course forum, likely related to deploying a Python API on Vercel.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Task Objective:** The user is instructed to create and deploy a Python application to Vercel. This application needs to expose an API endpoint.
2.  **Data Source:** The API should use data from a downloadable JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`, which contains "marks of 100 imaginary students."
3.  **API Request Format:** The API is expected to handle GET requests with query parameters for student names.
    *   **Example Request:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`
    *   This implies the API should be able to accept multiple `name` parameters.
4.  **API Response Format:** The API should return a JSON response containing the marks of the requested students.
    *   **Example JSON Response:**
        ```json
        { "marks": [ 10, 20 ] }
        ```
5.  **CORS Requirement:** The application must have CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled to allow GET requests from any origin. This is crucial for web applications that might call this API from a different domain.
6.  **Vercel URL Submission:** The user is asked to provide the deployed Vercel URL for their API.
    *   **Expected Format:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`
    *   **User Submitted URL:** `https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`
7.  **Error Message:** Below the submitted URL, an error is displayed.
    *   **Error:** `TypeError: Failed to fetch`

**Analysis of the Error:**

The `TypeError: Failed to fetch` typically indicates a network-related issue when a browser or client attempts to make a request. Common causes include:
*   The server (Vercel app) is not running or is unreachable.
*   A network problem preventing the client from connecting to the server.
*   CORS policy blocking the request (if the origin of the request is not allowed by the Vercel app's API). This is highly relevant given the explicit instruction to enable CORS.
*   DNS resolution issues.
*   The URL itself is incorrect or the endpoint `/api` does not exist on the deployed application.*



This is my vercel deployment

### Post #114 by **VivekS** (ds-students)
*January 30, 2025, 16:20 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely related to an exercise on interacting with web APIs, specifically FastAPI.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** The user is prompted to provide the API URL endpoint for a FastAPI application, with an example format provided.
2.  **User Input:** The user has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as the endpoint. This matches the suggested format.
3.  **Error Encountered:** Despite providing the seemingly correct URL, a validation error has occurred.
    *   The core issue is "Response undefined does not match expected". This implies that when a request was made to the provided URL, the server either returned no response, an empty response, or a response that could not be parsed, rather than the anticipated JSON data.
    *   The "expected" part of the error message clearly defines the structured JSON data that the endpoint is supposed to return: an array of objects, where each object represents a student and contains `studentId` (integer) and `class` (string) fields.
4.  **Next Steps/Hints:** The course material indicates that after this basic endpoint is verified, a subsequent check will involve adding a query parameter `?class=` to the URL to filter data.

**Transcription:**

**Question/Prompt:**
What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api

**User Input (in red-bordered input field):**
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api

**Error Message (in red text):**
Error: Response undefined does not match expected [{"studentId":57,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":67,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":117,"class":"11P"},{"studentId":311,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":429,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":524,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":790,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":890,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":954,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1136,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":1150,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1211,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1261,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1522,"class":"11P"},{"studentId":1598,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1689,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1714,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1719,"class":"5N"}]

**Subsequent Instruction/Hint:**
We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=... added and check if the response matches the data.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser window showing the result of an API call, likely from a local development server.

### Key Information:

1.  **API Endpoint and Query:** The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W` indicates a GET request was made to an API running locally (port 8000). The query parameters `class=5N`, `class=1T`, `class=11P`, and `class=9W` suggest that the user is requesting data for students belonging to these specific classes.
2.  **API Response Format:** The response is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) array of objects. Each object represents a student and contains two key-value pairs:
    *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing the student's unique ID.
    *   `"class"`: A string representing the class the student belongs to (e.g., "5N", "1T", "11P", "9W").
3.  **Data Content:** The response lists multiple students, each associated with one of the classes specified in the query parameters. This demonstrates a common pattern of filtering data based on query parameters in an API.
4.  **Browser Feature:** The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the browser (or an extension) has functionality to format raw JSON responses for better readability, though in this specific output, the JSON is still displayed as a single, long line.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

**URL/Command:**
`127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`

**API Response (JSON Data):**
`[{"studentId":57,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":67,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":117,"class":"11P"},{"studentId":311,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":429,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":524,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":790,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":890,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":954,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1136,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":1150,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1211,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1261,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1522,"class":"11P"},{"studentId":1598,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1689,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1714,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1719,"class":"5N"}]`

[@23F3002987\_J\_SRI\_BAL](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f3002987_j_sri_bal) ,

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows an access denial page from Vercel, a platform commonly used for deploying web applications, including those built for data science projects (e.g., Streamlit apps, Dashboards, APIs).

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform and URL:** The user is attempting to access a resource hosted on `vercel.com`. The URL in the browser address bar is `https://vercel.com/sso/access/request?next=%2Ffsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-project.vercel.app%2F`. This indicates a Single Sign-On (SSO) access request process to a Vercel-deployed application named `sri-balajis-project`.
2.  **Access Status:** The primary message is "Team Access Required".
3.  **User Identity:** The user is currently signed in as `jivraj-18`.
4.  **Reason for Denial:** The user cannot access the specific "unique deployment URL" because they are "not a member of the team" that owns or has access to this deployment. The mention of "this branch" suggests a version control (e.g., Git) context, where deployments are often tied to specific branches.
5.  **Suggested Solutions/Alternatives:**
    *   The user can view the "latest version of this branch by requesting access to the up-to-date deployment URL." This implies there might be a different, more general, or public URL for the current version, or that access to *this specific* unique deployment requires explicit team membership.
    *   An option to "Log in with a different Vercel Account" is provided, suggesting that the `jivraj-18` account does not possess the necessary team permissions.

**Transcribed Text (Messages and Commands/Errors):**

*   **Browser URL (relevant part showing the target application):**
    `https://vercel.com/sso/access/request?next=%2Ffsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-project.vercel.app%2F`
*   **Main Heading:**
    `Team Access Required`
*   **Signed In User:**
    `You are signed in as jivraj-18.`
*   **Error/Access Denial Message:**
    `You cannot access this unique deployment URL as you are not a member of the team. You can view the latest version of this branch by requesting access to the up-to-date deployment URL.`
*   **Action Link:**
    `Log in with a different Vercel Account`*



Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the Vercel dashboard for a "Production Deployment" of a project named `jivraj-18s-projects`.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Deployment Status:** The deployment is currently in a `Ready` state, indicating that the application has been successfully built and deployed to Vercel's servers. It was created on "28 Jan by jivraj-18".
2.  **Error Message:** Despite the deployment being ready, the main content area shows a "Not Found" error. This suggests that while the application itself is deployed and running, the specific URL path being accessed (`/api` in the browser bar) does not exist within the deployed application.
3.  **Accessed URL:** The browser's address bar shows `https://vercel.com/jivraj-18s-projects/api`. This is the Vercel project dashboard URL, not necessarily the deployed application's URL directly, but it indicates the user is navigating within their project context, possibly trying to view a specific endpoint's status or output. The "Not Found" message, however, is being rendered *by the deployed application* when the user tries to access a path that doesn't exist on its server.
4.  **Deployment Details:**
    *   **Deployment ID:** `api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app` (This is a unique, temporary URL for this specific deployment instance).
    *   **Domains:** `api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app` (This appears to be the primary Vercel-provided domain for the deployment, with `+2` indicating two additional domains are associated, likely including the production domain).
5.  **Debugging Tools:** Buttons for "Build Logs" and "Runtime Logs" are visible, which would be crucial for diagnosing why the specific path is "Not Found" even though the deployment is ready. The runtime logs would show server-side errors related to route handling.
6.  **Source & Deployment Method:** The "Source" section indicates the ability to "View code" (suggesting integration with a Git repository) and shows the command used to deploy.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Browser URL:** `https://vercel.com/jivraj-18s-projects/api`
*   **Error Title:** `Not Found`
*   **Error Message:** `The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.`
*   **Deployment ID:** `api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`
*   **Primary Domain:** `api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app`
*   **Deployment Command:** `>_ vercel deploy`*



If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts.

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

The browser's address bar and the network request name clearly show a GET request being made to a local development server.
*   **URL:** `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`
*   **Endpoint:** `/api`
*   **Host:** `127.0.0.1:8000` (localhost on port 8000, common for development servers like Django, Flask, or Node.js applications).
*   **Query Parameters:** The request includes multiple `class` parameters (`class=5N`, `class=1T`, `class=11P`, `class=9W`), indicating that the API is being queried to retrieve data for students belonging to these specific classes. This suggests a filtering mechanism is in place.

**2. API Response (JSON Data):**
The left panel displays the raw response from the API, formatted as JSON. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a student.
*   **Structure:** An array `[]` containing multiple JSON objects `{}`.
*   **Object Fields:** Each object has two key-value pairs:
    *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing the unique ID of a student.
    *   `"class"`: A string representing the class the student belongs to (e.g., "5N", "1T", "11P", "9W").
*   **Purpose:** This data likely provides a list of student IDs and their corresponding classes, filtered by the classes specified in the URL query parameters. This is typical data retrieved for analytical or display purposes in a data science context (e.g., fetching a subset of student records).

**Transcription of the JSON Response Data:**
```json
[{"studentId":57, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":67, "class":"1T"},{"studentId":117, "class":"11P"},{"studentId":311, "class":"9W"},{"studentId":429, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":524, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":790, "class":"9W"},{"studentId":890, "class":"9W"},{"studentId":954, "class":"9W"},{"studentId":1136, "class":"1T"},{"studentId":1150, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":1211, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":1261, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":1522, "class":"11P"},{"studentId":1598, "class":"9W"},{"studentId":1689, "class":"9W"},{"studentId":1714, "class":"5N"},{"studentId":1719, "class":"5N"}]
```

**3. Network Tab Details:**
The right panel shows the Chrome Developer Tools, with the "Network" tab active, providing performance and status information for the API request.
*   **Request Name:** The name of the request matches the URL: `api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`
*   **Status:** `200` (HTTP OK), indicating the request was successful and the server returned the expected data without errors.
*   **Type:** `document` (while the content is JSON, the browser categorizes a direct URL navigation response as a document).
*   **Size:** `694 B` (The size of the data transferred).
*   **Time:** `12 ms` (The time taken for the request to complete).
*   **Summary:**
    *   `1 requests`
    *   `694 B transferred`
    *   `568 B resources`
    *   `Finish: 12 ms`
    *   `DOMContentLoaded: 27 ms`
    *   `Load: 28 ms`

**4. Console/Issues:**
The bottom pane of the Developer Tools shows the "Issues" tab is selected.
*   **Issue Message:** `A form field element should have an id or name attribute`
    *   This is an HTML validation warning, not directly related to the API's functionality or the JSON response itself. It indicates that some form element in the underlying HTML structure (possibly a rendered page if this API call is part of a larger web application) is missing a standard `id` or `name` attribute, which can affect accessibility or form submission.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows a user interacting with a local API endpoint through a web browser (Chrome) and inspecting the response using Chrome Developer Tools.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Browser Context & API Interaction:**
*   **URL:** The user is accessing a local API endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`
    *   `127.0.0.1:8000`: Indicates a local development server running on port 8000.
    *   `/api`: Likely the base path for an API.
    *   `?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`: These are query parameters. The `class` parameter is repeated, suggesting the API is being queried to retrieve data for students belonging to multiple specific classes: "5N", "1T", "11P", and "9W".
*   **Display Mode:** The "Pretty-print" checkbox is enabled, meaning the browser is rendering the raw JSON response in a human-readable, formatted way.
*   **Tab Title:** The browser tab is titled "TDS 20", potentially referring to a course or project like "The Data Science 20".

**2. API Response Data:**
The main content area displays the JSON response from the API call. It's an array of JSON objects, where each object represents a student and contains their ID and assigned class.

*   **Transcribed Data:**
    ```json
    [{"studentId":57,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":67,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":117,"class":"11P"},{"studentId":311,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":429,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":524,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":790,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":890,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":954,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1136,"class":"1T"},{"studentId":1150,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1211,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1261,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1522,"class":"11P"},{"studentId":1598,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1689,"class":"9W"},{"studentId":1714,"class":"5N"},{"studentId":1719,"class":"5N"}]
    ```
    *   Each object has two key-value pairs: `"studentId"` (an integer) and `"class"` (a string).
    *   The classes returned (5N, 1T, 11P, 9W) match the query parameters in the URL, indicating the API successfully filtered the data.

**3. Chrome Developer Tools (Right Pane):**
*   **Active Tab:** The "Console" tab within the Developer Tools is active, but the main console area is empty, meaning there are no JavaScript errors or `console.log` messages displayed.
*   **Issues Tab:** The "Issues" sub-tab is also visible and indicates 1 issue.
*   **Transcribed Error/Warning Message:**
    ```
    A form field element should have an id or name attribute
    ```
    *   This is an informational warning (indicated by the blue message icon) from Chrome DevTools, often related to accessibility or best practices for HTML forms. It's not an error that prevents the API call or data display, but rather a suggestion for front-end code improvement.
    *   The "Group by kind" checkbox is unchecked, and "Include third-party cookie issues" is checked.*



  
[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , Thankyou for the quick response. I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to.

If I entered the URL I get the error Failed to fetch  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely an assignment or a problem statement, focusing on deploying a Python API on Vercel.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** Students are tasked with creating and deploying a Python application to Vercel.
2.  **Data Source:** The application needs to utilize a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`, which contains the "marks of 100 imaginary students."
3.  **API Functionality:**
    *   The deployed Python app must expose an API endpoint at `/api`.
    *   This API should accept GET requests with two `name` query parameters (e.g., `?name=X&name=Y`).
    *   When called, the API should return a JSON response containing the marks for the students specified by `name=X` and `name=Y`.
4.  **CORS Requirement:** It is explicitly stated that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must be enabled to allow GET requests from any origin.
5.  **User's Problem:** The user has entered their Vercel deployment URL and is encountering an error, indicating a problem with fetching data from their deployed API.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **Required Data File:**
    `q-vercel-python.json`

*   **Example API Request URL (template):**
    `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`

*   **Example Expected JSON Response:**
    ```json
    "marks": [10, 20]
    ```
    *(Note: This appears to be a dictionary with a key "marks" and a list of two integer values.)*

*   **CORS Instruction:**
    `Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.`

*   **Expected Vercel URL Format:**
    `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`

*   **User-Entered Vercel URL:**
    `https://tdsproject1-ltjsdpii1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api`

*   **Error Message:**
    `TypeError: Failed to fetch`*



If I run the same in my browser, I get the output (just I tried for two name available in json file)  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot, detailing the key information, and transcribing the requested elements:

---

**Key Information from the Screenshot:**

This screenshot displays a web browser (Google Chrome) indicating a user interacting with a deployed web application, likely an API, within the context of a data science course.

1.  **Project Context:** The browser tabs suggest the user is working on a project named "tdsproject1" for a course, possibly titled "TDS 2025". Other tabs like "My Dashboard", "Graded Assignments", and "Deploy Python" further reinforce this academic/course-related environment.
2.  **Deployment Platform:** The application is deployed on **Vercel**, as indicated by the domain `projects.vercel.app` in the URL and the "Vercel" tab.
3.  **API Interaction:** The URL `.../api?...` clearly shows the user is accessing an **API endpoint**.
4.  **URL Parameters:** The URL includes query parameters: `?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY`. Notably, the `name` parameter is duplicated, which could be an intentional design choice, a test scenario, or a potential issue in how the URL was constructed or how the API handles multiple values for the same parameter.
5.  **API Response (JSON Output):** The primary content displayed in the browser window is a **JSON object**, which is the direct response from the accessed API endpoint.
6.  **"Pretty-print" Option:** There's an unchecked checkbox labeled "Pretty-print", suggesting the browser (or an extension) offers functionality to format raw JSON output for better readability. In this case, the JSON is already quite compact.

---

**Transcriptions:**

*   **URL:**
    `tdsproject1-ltjsdpi1-23i2003853-projects.vercel.app/api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY`

*   **Content Displayed (API Response):**
    `{"marks":[1,41]}`

*   **Text/Label in Browser Interface:**
    `Pretty-print`*



Kindly help me to fix the issue

### Post #123 by **Yashvardhan** (ds-students)
*January 31, 2025, 06:06 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

This screenshot displays a problem encountered by a user attempting to set up and interact with a local large language model (LLM) server using Llamafile and expose it via ngrok.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Objective:** The user is instructed to download `Llamafile`, run a specific LLM model (`llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`) with it, and then create an `ngrok` tunnel to the Llamafile server. The final step is to provide the public `ngrok` URL.

2.  **Tools/Technologies Involved:**
    *   **Llamafile:** A single-file executable format for distributing and running large language models. It implies the user is running an LLM locally.
    *   **ngrok:** A tunneling service that exposes local servers to the internet via a public URL. This is used to make the local Llamafile server accessible remotely.

3.  **User Input/Response:** The user has successfully obtained and entered an `ngrok` URL, which conforms to the expected `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/` format. This suggests the `ngrok` tunnel itself was established.

4.  **Problem/Error:** Immediately after providing the `ngrok` URL, an error message appears in a red box. The primary error message is **"Response is too old"**, followed by a detailed JSON payload.

5.  **Context of the Error:** The JSON payload provides more details about the response that was deemed "too old":
    *   It's a `chat.completion` object, indicating an interaction with the LLM API.
    *   The LLM (despite `model:"unknown"`) did process a prompt and generated content (`"completion_tokens":29`, `"prompt_tokens":31`, `"total_tokens":60`).
    *   The content generated by the `assistant` (LLM) itself contains specific strings like `"user": "23f2004644"` and `"domain": "ds.study.iitm.ac.in"`. This suggests the LLM or an intermediary system processed some input related to a user ID and a specific domain (likely from the course platform itself).
    *   A `created` timestamp (`1738303197`) is present, which is a Unix timestamp. Converting this timestamp to a human-readable date reveals it corresponds to a very recent date/time (e.g., January 2025, if the user is currently in late 2024, or a specific date/time in late 2024).

### Exact Transcriptions:

**Instructions/Prompts:**
```
Download Llamafile. Run the llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile model with it.

Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok.

What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/
```

**User-Provided URL (or input field value):**
```
https://6714-13-71-3-97.ngrok-free.app/
```

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Response is too old: {"choices":[{"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"message":{"content":"\"\"\"\n\n \"user\": \"23f2004644\",\n \"domain\": \"ds.study.iitm.ac.in\"\n\n\"\"\" <leot_id>","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1738303197,"id":"chatcmpl-Ju9368HuUNKVAiF32ECG1nj3nROtbpoH","model":"unknown","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":29,"prompt_tokens":31,"total_tokens":60}}
```

---

### Analysis of the "Response is too old" Error:

The "Response is too old" error is typically encountered when a client, an API gateway, or an intermediary service (like Cloudflare, a proxy, or even the browser itself) receives a response where the `Date` header or an internal timestamp (like the `created` field in the JSON) is significantly out of sync with the client's current time, or it falls outside an acceptable freshness window.

**Possible Causes:**
1.  **Clock Skew:** The most common cause is a time difference between the server (where Llamafile and ngrok are running, generating the `created` timestamp) and the client (the browser or application displaying this forum, which receives the response). If the server's clock is set too far in the past or future relative to the client, this error can occur.
2.  **Caching/Freshness Policies:** The platform hosting the forum or an intervening proxy might have strict caching or freshness policies, rejecting responses that appear to be stale based on their `Date` headers or internal timestamps.
3.  **Specific Course Logic:** Given the embedded `user` and `domain` information within the assistant's content (`"user": "23f2004644", "domain": "ds.study.iitm.ac.in"`), it's possible the course platform has a very specific validation step that checks the freshness of the LLM's response based on the `created` timestamp, perhaps expecting it to be within a few seconds of the request time.
4.  **Network Latency/Timeouts:** While the primary error isn't a timeout, extreme latency could theoretically lead to a response being "too old" by the time it reaches the validator, if the validation window is very tight.

**Debugging Steps a User Might Take:**
*   **Synchronize Clocks:** Ensure the system clock on the machine running Llamafile and ngrok is accurate and synchronized with a reliable time server (e.g., using NTP).
*   **Check Server Logs:** Look for logs from the Llamafile server or ngrok to see if they report any issues or what `Date` headers they are sending.
*   **Browser Cache/Extensions:** Clear browser cache or try an incognito window, as browser extensions could sometimes interfere.
*   **Test Directly:** If possible, try making an API call directly to the `ngrok` URL using `curl` or Postman to observe the raw response headers and body without the forum's intermediary logic.

In summary, the user has successfully set up the technical infrastructure (Llamafile server + ngrok tunnel), but the interaction is failing due to a time-sensitive validation, likely stemming from clock synchronization issues or strict freshness policies in the data science course's environment.*

    population = int(data.query("city == @city")["population"].values[0])
    return {"city": city, "population": population}
```

**Notes on the Code (Observation, not part of exact transcription):**
*   There's a logical gap in the `async def root` function: the variable `city` is used within `data.query("city == @city")`, but `city` is not visible as a parameter in the function signature `async def root(class_name: List[str] = Query(default=[],alias="class")):`. It's highly probable the function signature is cut off and `city: str` (or similar) is an additional parameter. This missing parameter for `city` could be the source of one of the `3` warnings.*



  
the async def root() this command line in image is solution for our problem.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You *do not* create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

What am i missing here? i am also facing same issue, question 9 . attached screenshots.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a web browser interface, likely used by a student or instructor in a data science course, focusing on the comparison of JSON data.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Context:**
    *   The open tabs suggest a course environment: "TDS 2025 Jan GA2" (The Data Science course, January 2025, Graded Assignment 2), "Graded Assignment 2", "GA2 - Deployment Tr" (likely "Deployment Troubleshooting").
    *   An institution: "Indian Institute of Technology" is visible in one of the tab titles.
    *   Other tabs hint at related technologies: "docker hub - Google".

2.  **Primary Tool/Website:**
    *   The main content area displays `jsondiff.com`, a tool specifically designed for comparing JSON data.
    *   The interface shows two side-by-side panels, indicating a comparison is being performed or prepared. In this particular screenshot, the content in both panels appears to be identical, resulting in no highlighted differences by the tool.

3.  **Data Being Analyzed:**
    *   The data in both panels is a JSON array of objects.
    *   Each object represents a record with two key-value pairs: `"class"` and `"studentId"`.
    *   This data likely represents student records, categorizing students into different classes (e.g., "1N", "8N", "8X", "4Z") and providing a unique student identifier.
    *   The dataset is quite large, spanning 88 entries visible in the current view, starting with `studentId: 60` and going up to `studentId: 1831`.

4.  **Related Endpoints/APIs:**
    *   Two tabs are open to `localhost:8000/api` and `127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This strongly suggests that the JSON data being compared (or about to be compared) is likely the output from a local API endpoint, possibly developed as part of the "Graded Assignment 2" deployment. The user might be verifying the API's output against an expected dataset or comparing the output of two different versions/deployments of the API.

5.  **Inferred Purpose:**
    Given the tabs related to "Deployment Troubleshooting" and local API endpoints, the user is very likely:
    *   Verifying the correct output of an API endpoint developed for the assignment.
    *   Comparing the JSON data retrieved from two different API instances or two different runs of the same API.
    *   Debugging issues related to data consistency or structure in an application that processes student data.

---

**Transcribed Code/Data (JSON Sample):**

The data shown in both panels of `jsondiff.com` is identical. Here is a sample of the JSON structure and its content:

```json
[
  {
    "class": "1N",
    "studentId": 60
  },
  {

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an online assignment interface, likely from a data science course, focused on deploying and testing a web API (FastAPI in this case). The user has submitted an API endpoint, and the system is grading its correctness based on specified requirements. The browser's developer tools are open to the Network tab, showing the actual HTTP requests and responses.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Assignment Context:**
    *   **Course:** "TDS 2025 Jan GA2" (likely an assignment from a "Tools for Data Science" course).
    *   **Assignment Name:** "GA2 - Deployment"
    *   **Due Date:** Sunday, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST.
    *   **Current Score:** 7.5 / 10.
    *   **Institution:** Indian Institute of Technology (visible in one of the browser tabs).

2.  **API Requirements:**
    *   The API endpoint should filter student data based on `class` query parameters.
    *   Example: `/api?class=1A` for students in class 1A, and `/api?class=1A&class=1B` for students in both 1A and 1B.
    *   The API must handle multiple `class` parameters.
    *   Students must be returned in the *same order* as they appear in the CSV file (implying an internal data source and specific sorting).
    *   **CORS:** The API must have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled to allow GET requests from any origin.
    *   **Expected Endpoint:** The system expects the API endpoint to be `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.

3.  **User's Submission & Error:**
    *   The user has submitted `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as their API URL endpoint.
    *   The system indicates an error, stating that the API's response does not match the expected output for a specific test case.
    *   The error message includes the exact JSON array that was expected by the grading system.
    *   The system confirms it performs checks by sending requests with `?class=...` query parameters.

4.  **Network Activity (Browser Developer Tools):**
    *   The **Network** tab is active, showing two identical HTTP GET requests made to the user's API.
    *   **Request URL:** `api?class=1N&class=8N&class=8X&class=4Z` (This is the specific test case being run that caused the error).
    *   **Response Preview:** The "Preview" pane shows the JSON response received from the user's API for the aforementioned request. It's a list of student objects, each with `studentId` and `class` fields.

**Transcriptions:**

**1. Assignment Instructions / Problem Description:**

```
If the URL has a query parameter class, it should return only students in those classes. For example, /api?class=1A should return only students in class 1A and &class=1B should return only students in class 1A and 1B. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes).

Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.

What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

**2. User Input (API URL Endpoint):**

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

**3. Error Message (Exact as displayed):**

```
Error: Response undefined does not match expected [{"studentId":60,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":64,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":106,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":270,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":411,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":522,"class":"8X"}, {"studentId":525,"class":"8X"}, {"studentId":673,"class":"4Z"}, {"studentId":710,"class":"4Z"}, {"studentId":802,"class":"8X"}, {"studentId":934,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1034,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1331,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1354,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1485,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1511,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1573,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1591,"class":"8X"}, {"studentId":1611,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1678,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":1826,"class":"8X"}, {"studentId":1831,"class":"4Z"}, {"studentId":1881,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":1950,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":1972,"class":"4Z"}, {"studentId":1982,"class":"4Z"}]
```

**4. Grader Confirmation (Below Error Message):**

```
We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=... added and check if the response matches the data.
```

**5. Network Request (from "Name" column in Dev Tools):**

```
api?class=1N&class=8N&class=8X&class=4Z
```

**6. Actual API Response (from "Preview" tab in Dev Tools):**

```json

@ carlton @ Jivraj  
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.  
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.  
Do I need to do anything else ?  
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.  
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum or an interactive exercise, likely related to Docker and containerization. The user is being prompted to provide a specific Docker image URL and is encountering an error.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Context/Goal:** The user is asked to provide a "Docker image URL" and is given a template for the expected format: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`.
2.  **User Input:** The user has entered a URL that *exactly matches* the provided template structure, replacing `$USER` with `23f2000573` and `$REPO` with `first-rep`. The input field is highlighted with a red border, indicating an error.
3.  **Error Encountered:** After submitting the URL (presumably by clicking the "Check" button), an error message is displayed.
4.  **Nature of the Error:** The error message indicates that the system is attempting to find a *tag* named `23f2000573` within the `first-rep` repository on Docker Hub. This suggests a **misinterpretation by the validation system**:
    *   It seems to be parsing `23f2000573` (which should be the Docker Hub username/namespace) as an image tag.
    *   Standard Docker image URLs typically follow `user/repository:tag` (e.g., `username/my-repo:latest`). The `/general` suffix in the template provided by the course is unusual for a direct image URL, and might be specific to how this course validates submissions or is a placeholder for a tag. The error, however, specifically points to `23f2000573` as the incorrect tag. This points to a fundamental parsing issue in the validation logic given the template.
5.  **Call to Action:** A "Check" button is present, which the user would press to validate their input.

---

### Transcriptions:

*   **Question/Instruction:**
    ```
    What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general
    ```
*   **User Input (in the text field):**
    ```
    https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general
    ```
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags
    ```
*   **Button Text:**
    ```

    ```*



I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The screenshot displays a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal session. The prompt `giri@GIRI:~$` indicates that a user named "giri" is logged into a machine named "GIRI" and is currently in their home directory (`~`). The `$` symbol signifies a standard user prompt, typically found in Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
2.  **Docker Command Execution:** The user has executed a Docker command: `docker run`. This command is used to run a command in a new container, creating it if it doesn't already exist.
3.  **Docker Image:** The command targets a specific Docker image named `23f2000573/first-rep:v1`.
    *   `23f2000573`: This likely represents the Docker Hub username or organization. In a course context, this could be a student ID or a specific project identifier.
    *   `first-rep`: This is the name of the image repository, suggesting "first repository."
    *   `:v1`: This is the image tag, indicating "version 1."
    This suggests the user is attempting to run a container based on a specific, versioned image that was likely built or pushed as part of a course assignment involving Docker.
4.  **Container Output:** The line `abc.py` directly below the `docker run` command is most likely the output from the Docker container. This suggests that when the `23f2000573/first-rep:v1` container starts and runs, its primary action or a part of its entry point is to print the string "abc.py" to standard output before (presumably) exiting. This could indicate the container is designed to execute a Python script named `abc.py`, or simply to confirm the presence/context of such a file within the container.
5.  **Current State:** The faint light green block on the line following `abc.py` indicates the current cursor position, meaning the container has finished its execution (or is running in the background) and the terminal is now awaiting further user input.
6.  **Context in Data Science:** This interaction is common in data science courses focusing on MLOps, reproducibility, and deployment. Students often learn to package their data processing scripts, machine learning models, or analytical applications into Docker containers for consistent execution across different environments.

**Transcription:**

```
giri@GIRI:~$ docker run 23f2000573/first-rep:v1
abc.py
```*



This is how my docker hub repository looks,



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the "General" tab of a Docker Hub repository, providing an overview of its status, content, and related commands.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Docker Hub Context:**
*   The page is hosted on `hub.docker.com`.
*   The active navigation tab is "Repositories", indicating the user is managing their Docker images.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser window, showing the successful invocation of a web API endpoint and its JSON response.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **URL (Address Bar):**
    *   **Domain:** `new-deploy12345.vercel.app`
        *   This indicates the application is deployed on Vercel, a popular platform for static sites and serverless functions. The `new-deploy12345` part suggests a dynamically generated deployment name, possibly from a continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipeline or a specific branch/version.
    *   **Path:** `/api`
        *   This signifies that the request is being made to an API endpoint rather than a traditional web page.
    *   **Query Parameters:** `?name=Mn&name=m`
        *   The request includes two query parameters, both named `name`, with values `Mn` and `m` respectively. This is an interesting detail, as the server's logic would determine how it handles multiple parameters with the same name (e.g., uses the first, uses the last, combines them into a list).

2.  **Browser Tabs (Partially Visible):**
    *   `iitm-tds-project1/sc...`
    *   `PROJECT2/autolysis....`
    *   `2 Indian Institute of T...` (likely "Indian Institute of Technology")
    *   These tabs suggest the user is working on multiple projects, possibly related to data science courses at an "Indian Institute of Technology" (e.g., IIT Madras, given "IITM" in the first tab), and potentially utilizing GitHub for version control.

3.  **UI Element in Content Area:**
    *   `Pretty-print` (followed by an unchecked checkbox)
        *   This feature, often found in browser developer tools or API testing extensions, allows the user to format raw JSON/XML output for better readability. Although the checkbox is unchecked, the displayed JSON *is* pretty-printed, suggesting the browser's default behavior or an underlying extension is automatically formatting it.

4.  **API Response Body:**
    *   The primary content displayed is a JSON object.

### Transcriptions:

**URL:**
`new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m`

**UI Element Text:**
`Pretty-print`

**Code/Data (JSON Response):**
`{"marks":[5,78]}`*



  
here it is giving output but when i run on question page it gives error.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information

1.  **Purpose:** The screenshot shows a validation step within a data science course, likely for an assignment or project involving API deployment. The student is required to provide a Vercel URL for their deployed application's API.
2.  **Expected URL Format:** The course system explicitly provides the expected format: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. This indicates that the deployed application should have an API endpoint accessible at the `/api` path.
3.  **Student's Submission:** The student has entered a URL that structurally matches the expected format, suggesting they have attempted a deployment.
4.  **Error Type:** The validation failed with a specific error message. The core of the problem is that the system expected a list of numerical values, but instead received a different set of values, predominantly `"Not Found"`.
5.  **Likely Cause of Error:** The "Not Found" messages in the received output (`[48,"Not Found","Not Found","Not Found","Not Found"]`) are highly indicative. This suggests that when the course's automated checker tried to access the provided Vercel URL and potentially query it for specific data points (which would presumably return the "Expected" numerical values), it encountered "Not Found" responses. This could mean:
    *   The Vercel deployment itself is not active or correctly configured.
    *   The `/api` endpoint on the `new-deploy12345` application does not exist or is misconfigured to return the expected data.
    *   The API is returning HTTP 404 (Not Found) for the specific requests the checker is making, rather than the intended numerical data.

### Transcribed Content

**Prompt/Instruction:**

Try these [@21f3000745](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f3000745)

1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
   **If this doesn’t work, then:**
2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the key information and transcribed details:

## Key Information Analysis:

This screenshot displays the terminal output from a development environment, likely VS Code, running a Python web application.

1.  **Application Type:** The presence of "Fastapi" in the top right (next to "python3.12") and the log messages from "Uvicorn" strongly indicate that this is a **FastAPI** web application.
2.  **Server Status:**
    *   **Uvicorn Server:** The server (`Uvicorn`) is successfully running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. This is the standard local development address for web applications.
    *   **Live Reloading:** The server is configured for "live reloading" (`StatReload`), meaning it's watching for changes in the specified directory (`F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level1\TERM 2\TDS\Week 2\Fastapi`) and will automatically restart the application when files are modified. This is a common and helpful feature during development.
    *   **Application Startup:** The logs confirm "Application startup complete.", meaning the FastAPI application has initialized successfully and is ready to handle requests.
3.  **Request & Response Activity:**
    *   **Initial Failures (404 Not Found):**
        *   A request to the root path (`/`) resulted in a `404 Not Found`. This means there's no endpoint (route) defined for the base URL in the FastAPI application.
        *   A subsequent request for `/favicon.ico` (the browser icon) also resulted in a `404 Not Found`, which is typical if a custom favicon isn't explicitly served.
    *   **Successful Requests (200 OK):**
        *   Requests to the `/api` endpoint were successful, returning `200 OK`. This indicates that there is a defined endpoint at `/api`.
        *   Multiple requests to `/api?class=1A` (i.e., the `/api` endpoint with a query parameter `class` set to `1A`) were also successful, returning `200 OK`. This demonstrates that the `/api` endpoint is designed to handle this specific query parameter and return a valid response.
4.  **Environment Details:**
    *   **Python Version:** Python 3.12 is being used.
    *   **File Path Context:** The application is located within a deep directory structure: `F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level1\TERM 2\TDS\Week 2\Fastapi`. This path suggests a structured course environment (e.g., "BS Data Science", "Diploma Level 1", "Term 2", "Week 2").

In summary, the screenshot shows a typical development session for a FastAPI application where the server is running with live reloading. While the root path is not handled, specific API endpoints (`/api` and `/api?class=1A`) are functioning correctly, indicating successful API development for handling data requests.

## Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

```

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a successful API call made from a web browser, displaying the JSON response. It's highly relevant to data science courses, particularly modules on data acquisition, web scraping, or interacting with RESTful APIs.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Key Information

1.  **API Endpoint and Request:**
    *   The URL in the browser's address bar indicates a GET request was made to a local development server.
    *   **Base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
        *   `127.0.0.1`: This is the loopback IP address, meaning the server is running on the user's own machine.
        *   `8000`: This is a commonly used port for local development servers (e.g., those built with Flask, Django, Node.js, etc.).
        *   `/api`: This path suggests an API endpoint designed to serve data.
    *   **Query Parameter:** `?class=1A`
        *   This is a filter applied to the request, asking the API to return data specifically for students belonging to "class 1A". This demonstrates how parameters can be used to customize API responses.

2.  **API Response (JSON Data):**
    *   The browser has received a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response, which is a standard format for data interchange on the web.
    *   **Top-level Structure:** The response is a JSON object with a single key, `"students"`, whose value is a JSON array (`[]`).
    *   **Array Content:** The array contains multiple JSON objects, each representing a single student.
    *   **Student Object Structure:** Each student object has two key-value pairs:
        *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing a unique identifier for the student.
        *   `"class"`: A string indicating the class the student belongs to, which consistently matches `"1A"` as requested in the query parameter.
    *   **Data Consistency:** All listed students indeed belong to "class 1A", confirming the API successfully processed the query parameter.

3.  **Browser Features:**
    *   **"Pretty-print" Checkbox:** This indicates that the browser (or an installed extension, common for JSON viewers) is automatically formatting the raw JSON response into a human-readable, indented structure. This is extremely helpful for debugging and understanding API responses.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages

There are no error messages; the response is successful.

**URL Command (as it appears in the address bar):**
`127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`

**JSON Data (exactly as displayed in the content area):**
```json
{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 224,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 226,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 750,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 1241,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 1408,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 1704,
      "class": "1A"
    }
  ]
}
```*



  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The screenshot displays a section of an online data science or web development course, likely an interactive assignment or check, focused on building a FastAPI application.
2.  **API Requirements:**
    *   The API should have an endpoint that accepts a query parameter named `class`.
    *   If `class` is provided, the API should filter students to only those belonging to the specified class(es).
    *   Multiple classes can be specified using repeated `class` parameters (e.g., `?class=1A&class=1B`).
    *   Students returned should maintain their original order from a presumed CSV file, not the order of the `class` parameters.
    *   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** must be enabled to allow GET requests from any origin.
3.  **Task:** The user is prompted to enter the API URL endpoint for their FastAPI application.
4.  **User Input:** The user has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` into the input field.
5.  **Problem/Error:** Below the input field, a red error message is displayed, indicating a failure to connect to or retrieve data from the specified URL. This suggests the FastAPI server might not be running, or there's a network/CORS issue preventing the connection.
6.  **Testing Mechanism:** The system will attempt to validate the provided URL by sending requests to it, including one with a `?class=...` query parameter, and checking the response against expected data.
7.  **Interaction:** A "Check" button allows the user to submit their URL for validation.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Instructional Text (Query Parameter Examples):**
    *   `/api?class=1A`
    *   `/api?class=1A&class=`
*   **Suggested API URL Endpoint (Example):**
    *   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **User-Entered API URL Endpoint:**
    *   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **Error Message:**
    *   `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
*   **Testing Query Parameter (Instructional Text):**
    *   `?class=...`*

Hi [@23f2000573](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000573) ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a set of command-line instructions for building, running, and deploying a container using `podman`, a daemonless container engine, primarily interacting with `docker.io` (Docker Hub).

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The commands outline a complete workflow for containerizing an application: logging in, building an image, running it locally, and pushing it to a public container registry (Docker Hub).
*   **Tool Used:** `podman` is the primary command-line tool, indicating a preference for a daemonless container environment, similar to or as an alternative to Docker.
*   **Container Naming:** The example container image is consistently named `py-hello`.
*   **Docker Hub Integration:** Instructions involve creating an account on `https://hub.docker.com/` and then pushing images to `docker.io`, requiring the user's Docker Hub username.
*   **Image Tagging:** It demonstrates both pushing with the default `latest` tag and explicitly defining and using a custom tag (e.g., `dev`).
*   **Comments:** Each section of commands is clearly explained with comments (`#`).

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

```
To build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:

# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login
podman login docker.io

# Build and run the container
podman build -t py-hello .
podman run -it py-hello

# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.
podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello

# Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev
TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG
```*

Hi [@24f1002359](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the Chrome Developer Tools, specifically the **Console** tab, which is used for logging messages, executing JavaScript, and identifying errors in web applications.

### Key Information:

1.  **Console Context:** The user is viewing the console output for the `top` frame, indicating they are inspecting the main document. There's a filter field and "Default levels" selected, meaning all types of console messages (info, warnings, errors) are visible.
2.  **AJAX Request Flow:**
    *   The console first logs `starting ajax request to the resource.`, indicating that client-side JavaScript code has initiated an Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) request. This message originates from `index.html` on line 14.
    *   Immediately after, `ajax request done.` is logged, suggesting the JavaScript code responsible for setting up and sending the AJAX call has completed its execution. This message is from `index.html` on line 29.
    *   **Crucially, this "done" message does *not* imply the request was successful or that a response was received; it merely means the browser has processed the request setup.**
3.  **CORS Error (Critical Issue):**
    *   The most significant part is the prominent red error message with a red 'X' icon, indicating a severe issue that prevented the request from completing successfully.
    *   The error explicitly states `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.` This error is reported to originate from `index.html` on line 1.

### Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

**Console Output:**

1.  `starting ajax request to the resource.`
2.  `ajax request done.`
3.  `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`

**Source References:**

*   `index.html:14` (for the first log message)
*   `index.html:29` (for the second log message)
*   `index.html:1` (for the CORS error message)

### Expert Analysis and Interpretation:

This screenshot clearly shows a **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** error, which is a common security mechanism implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious cross-site interactions.

*   **The Problem:** The user's web page, likely loaded directly from the local file system (e.g., by opening `file:///path/to/index.html` in the browser), attempted to make an AJAX request to `http://google.com/`.
*   **'null' Origin:** When a web page is loaded directly from a local file, its "origin" is considered `null`. Browsers impose very strict security policies on `null` origins for security reasons.
*   **CORS Policy Violation:** The browser blocked the request because `google.com` (the "requested resource") did not send the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP header in its response. This header is required for a server to explicitly permit requests from different origins. Since `google.com` (like most public websites) does not permit arbitrary origins to fetch its content directly via `XMLHttpRequest` for security and performance reasons, the request from the `null` origin was denied.
*   **"ajax request done." Misconception:** The second log message `ajax request done.` is misleading in this context. It signifies that the *client-side JavaScript code* that initiated the `XMLHttpRequest` completed its synchronous execution. It does *not* mean the HTTP request successfully completed or received a valid response from `google.com`. The CORS error occurs at a lower level in the browser's network stack, preventing the response (or even a successful connection in some cases) from being delivered to the JavaScript code.

**Relevance to a Data Science Course Forum:**

In a data science context, especially when building web-based visualizations or interactive applications, students often need to fetch data from external APIs or servers. This CORS error is an incredibly common hurdle:

1.  **Local Development:** Students frequently encounter this when developing front-end code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) locally without a proper web server (e.g., using `file://` URLs). To resolve the `null` origin issue, they need to serve their `index.html` file using a simple local HTTP server (like Python's `http.server`, Node.js `serve` package, or a full-fledged Flask/Django/Node server). This will give their page a proper origin (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
2.  **API Interaction:** Even with a local server, they might hit CORS issues if the *API they are trying to consume* (e.g., a public data API) does not correctly implement CORS by sending the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that includes their page's origin. In such cases, they would need to either:
    *   Use a proxy server to forward requests.
    *   If they control the API, configure the API to send the necessary CORS headers.
    *   If it's a third-party API, check if it explicitly supports CORS or if there are alternative methods for data access.
3.  **Direct Scraping Attempt:** This specific example of trying to access `http://google.com/` directly via AJAX is almost certainly an attempt to "scrape" data or content from Google's main page. This is generally not how data is programmatically accessed from such services due to CORS and other anti-scraping measures. Data is typically accessed through official APIs designed for programmatic consumption.*



For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Kind regards.

for question 9 u can use ,

`from fastapi import FastAPI, Query`

and



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays Python code, almost certainly from a FastAPI application, defining a GET endpoint.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **FastAPI Endpoint Definition:** The `@app.get("/api")` decorator indicates that the function `api` below it will handle HTTP GET requests made to the `/api` path of the web application. This is a standard way to define routes in web frameworks like FastAPI.
2.  **Function Definition:** `def api(...)` defines the Python function that will execute when the `/api` GET endpoint is hit.
3.  **Query Parameter `class_`:**
    *   The function accepts a single parameter named `class_`. The trailing underscore `_` is a common Python convention to avoid naming conflicts with built-in keywords (like `class`).
    *   **Type Hinting:** It uses advanced type hinting with `Annotated` (a feature from Python 3.9+ used extensively in FastAPI for adding metadata to types).
    *   **Data Type:** The core data type is `list[str] | None`, meaning the `class_` parameter is expected to be either a list of strings or `None`. The `|` symbol is a union type operator (equivalent to `Union[list[str], None]`).
    *   **Query Parameter Source:** `Query(alias='class')` indicates that this parameter should be obtained from the URL's query string (e.g., `?class=value`).
    *   **Alias:** The `alias='class'` specifies that the actual query parameter name in the URL will be `class` (without the underscore), even though the Python variable is `class_`. This is useful when the external API parameter name differs from the internal code variable name.
    *   **Optional Parameter:** `= None` sets a default value of `None`, making the `class_` parameter optional. If the `class` query parameter is not provided in the URL, `class_` will default to `None`.

**In summary,** this code defines a FastAPI endpoint `/api` that can optionally accept a query parameter named `class`. If provided, this parameter will be parsed into a Python `list[str]` (e.g., if the URL is `/api?class=math&class=science`, `class_` will become `["math", "science"]`). If the `class` query parameter is not present in the URL, the `class_` variable inside the function will be `None`.

---

### Transcribed Code:

```python
@app.get("/api")
def api(class_: Annotated[list[str] | None, Query(alias='class')] = None,
```*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an online examination or assignment platform for a data science course, specifically "TDS 2025 Jan". The user is attempting a task related to publishing content on GitHub Pages.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Context and Platform:**
*   **Platform:** An online examination/assignment system, accessible via `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2`.
*   **Course/Exam:** "TDS 2025 Jan", likely a data science course.
*   **Progress:** The user has "01:37:36 left" on the timer and a "Score: 0/10", indicating an ongoing attempt.
*   **Interface:** The top part of the screen shows standard browser tabs and navigation. Below the header, there's a section that appears to be an embedded code editor or console, possibly part of a service like GitHub Codespaces, given the visible tabs for "CodeSpaces," "P main," "CodeStream," "Live Share," "Quokka," and "Wallaby." Some unreadable text within this area includes terms like "DEFINITION_ID," "gradgroup," "Parsed event values," "Repo Owner: community," and "Cleaning up orphan processes."

**2. Assignment Task:**
*   The task requires the user to "Publish a page using GitHub Pages that showcases your work."
*   A critical requirement is that a specific email address (`24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) *must* be present in the page's HTML.
*   The assignment also notes that "GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare which obfuscates emails." To prevent this, the user is instructed to "wrap your email address inside a:" specific HTML comment structure.
*   The user is then asked to provide the "GitHub Pages URL" for verification.

**3. User's Input and Attempt:**
*   **Submitted URL:** The user has submitted the URL `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1,?v=2`. The query parameters `?v=1,?v=2` are unusual, but they align with a hint provided later to "bust the cache."

**4. Error Message and Analysis:**
*   The system has returned an `Error` indicating a failure in verification.
*   The core of the error is: "24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response". This means the required email string was not found in the HTML content retrieved from the submitted URL.
*   Crucially, the error message includes the *actual HTML content* that the checker received from the provided URL.
    *   Within this HTML, the email address is not present in its original form. Instead, CloudFlare's email protection is evident:
        `<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#241610405715141415161644005704050d4d490a45470d4d6a"> <span class="__cf_email__" data-cloudflare-email="9aa8aefece9abaaaaaaaaab8abdabdafe9b4e9eeeefee3b4f3f3f7fbf7fb4fbf9b4f4f">email&#160;protected</span> </a>`
    *   This shows that CloudFlare has processed and obfuscated the email, replacing it with an encoded link and a "email protected" span, meaning the instruction to wrap the email in `<!--email_off-->` tags was either not followed correctly, or CloudFlare still processed it despite the tags. The checker is specifically looking for the raw email string, which is missing.

**5. Hint:**
*   A hint suggests adding `?v=1,?v=2` to the URL to bust the cache if recent changes aren't reflected. The user has already done this in their submitted URL, but the error is content-based, not caching-based.

Sir, the page I have published via GITHUB is as below:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser window (Google Chrome, in "Navigation privée" / Private browsing mode) showing a very simple personal webpage, likely related to a data science course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Current Webpage Content:**
*   **Page Title:** `My Model Page`
*   **Main Heading:** `My Model Page`
*   **Contact Information:** `Contact me at: 24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   This email address strongly suggests a student ID (`24ds1000121`) from a data science program at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).
*   **URL:** `ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`
    *   The `github.io` domain indicates that this is a GitHub Pages site, typically used for personal webpages, project documentation, or simple static web content. The `TDS-page` part likely refers to "The Data Science Page" or a similar abbreviation.

**2. Browser Tabs (Context of other open pages):**
Multiple tabs are open, providing significant context about the user's activities, which are heavily centered around a data science curriculum:
*   `My Dashboard - IIT M` (Suggests a student portal or course management system for IIT Madras).
*   `W0L3: Complex Data...` (Likely refers to "Week 0 Lesson 3" and a topic involving "Complex Data" from a course module).
*   `BDM Capstone` (Potentially "Big Data Management Capstone" or "Business Data Management Capstone" project, a common component in data science/analytics programs).
*   `About the Course :` (General course information).
*   `Graded Assignment` (Indicates graded coursework).
*   `Ex TDS 2025 Jan GA2 -` (This is very specific: "TDS" likely stands for "The Data Science" or a specific course code, "2025 Jan" for the intake/semester, and "GA2" for "Graded Assignment 2").
*   `My Model Page` (The currently active tab, matching the content displayed).

**3. System Information (Windows Taskbar):**
*   **Operating System:** Windows (judging by the taskbar icons and layout).
*   **Time and Date:** `17:58` on `02/02/2025` (February 2nd, 2025). This date is in the future relative to the current time of analysis, indicating either a future course intake or the system clock is set forward.
*   **Language:** `FRA` (French), visible in the system tray, matching "Navigation privée" (Private browsing) and "Rechercher" (Search) on the taskbar.

**Summary of Key Information:**
The screenshot shows a simple personal webpage, titled "My Model Page" and hosted on GitHub Pages, created by a student from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) for a data science program. The user is actively engaged in their data science studies, as evidenced by the numerous open tabs related to their course dashboard, specific lessons, graded assignments, and a capstone project for the "TDS 2025 Jan" batch. The page itself is minimalistic, providing only a title and a contact email, suggesting it might be a placeholder, a very early stage of a project display, or a requirement for submission.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are **no code snippets, command-line outputs, or error messages** visible on the webpage or within the browser interface in this screenshot. The page content is entirely static text.*

*February 02, 2025, 17:14 UTC*
Hi [@24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a `.nojekyll` file in your root folder of your repository.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a common debugging scenario in a web development context, likely within a data science course, where a student is submitting a GitHub Pages URL for an assignment.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Assignment Context:**
    *   The user is on an "Admin" panel for an assignment or quiz.
    *   There is a time limit: "01:19:33 left".
    *   The current score is "0 / 10", indicating the submission has not been successful yet.
    *   The task is to provide a "GitHub Pages URL" which is expected to follow the format `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`.

2.  **User Input & Immediate Error:**
    *   The user has entered the URL: `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`
    *   This input field is highlighted with a red border and an exclamation mark, indicating an error.

3.  **Detailed Error Message (from the assignment system):**
    *   The core of the problem is explained: The system is looking for a specific string within the response from the provided URL, but it's not found.
    *   The error message then displays the entire HTML content that the system received when it tried to access the user's URL.

4.  **Developer Tools (Chrome DevTools - Network Tab):**
    *   The right side of the screenshot shows Chrome Developer Tools, specifically the "Network" tab.
    *   A request for "TDS-page/" is visible, and the "Preview" pane is active.
    *   The "Preview" pane shows the rendered output of the HTML page, confirming that the page loads successfully in the browser. It displays "My Model Page" as a heading and "Contact me at: [email protected]" as text.
    *   The request summary indicates "1 requests", "0 B transferred", and a very fast load time of "61 ms". This suggests the page is accessible and responsive.

5.  **Troubleshooting Hint:**
    *   Below the error message, there's a suggestion: "If a recent change that's not reflected, add `?v=1`, `?v=2` to the URL to bust the cache." This is a standard practice to force browsers/proxies to fetch a fresh version of a page.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exact Transcription):**

*   **GitHub Pages URL entered by user:**
    `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`

*   **Error Message from the assignment system:**
    ```
    Error: 24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Model Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>My Model Page</h1>
    <p>Contact me at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#380a0c5c4b09080808090a09785c4b164b4c4d5c411651514c5516595b165156"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfeamil="c7f5f3a3b4f6f7f7f7f6f7f6f5f687a3b4e9b4b3bee9a6a4e9aea9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>
    <script data-cfasync="false" src="/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

*   **Troubleshooting Hint:**
    `If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache.`

**Analysis of the Problem:**

The core issue is that the assignment checker expects the literal string `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` to be present in the HTML source code received from the GitHub Pages URL. However, the HTML response shows that the email address is obfuscated by Cloudflare (`[email&#160;protected]`) and requires a client-side JavaScript (`cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js`) to decode and display the actual email address in the browser. The automated checker likely retrieves the raw HTML and does not execute JavaScript, hence it cannot find the expected string.

The student needs to modify their GitHub Pages content to include `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` directly in the HTML without Cloudflare's email obfuscation, or to place the exact string somewhere else on the page where the checker can find it.*



Kind regards

### Post #164 by **Deveshu Pathak** (ds-students)
*February 02, 2025, 17:17 UTC*
I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

This screenshot displays a problem description and an encountered error related to building a FastAPI application, likely as part of an assignment or practical exercise.

**Key Information:**

1.  **API Functionality Requirements:**
    *   The API should handle a query parameter named `class`.
    *   If the `class` parameter is present, the API should return only students belonging to the specified classes.
    *   Multiple classes can be specified using `&` (e.g., `class=1A&class=1B`).
    *   The order of returned students must match their original order in a CSV file, not the order in which classes were specified in the query.

2.  **CORS Requirement:**
    *   The API must have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled to allow GET requests from any origin. This is crucial for web applications interacting with the API from different domains.

3.  **API Endpoint:**
    *   The expected API URL endpoint for FastAPI is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This is the URL that the user has entered and presumably tested.

4.  **Error Message - Response Mismatch:**
    *   The core of the problem is an "Error: Response" indicating that the actual data returned by the API does not match the expected data.
    *   The error message provides two large JSON arrays:
        *   The first array is the `Response` (what the API actually returned).
        *   The second array, labeled `expected`, is what the API *should have* returned for the given request (which in this case, since no `class` parameter was used in the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, implies a default list or perhaps the full list if no filter is applied).
    *   The discrepancy suggests issues with the API's data retrieval, filtering, or default response logic.

5.  **Next Debugging Step:**
    *   The final line indicates the next debugging step: sending a request with the `?class=...` query parameter and comparing the response.

**Transcriptions of Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **Query Parameter Name:** `class`
*   **Example URL 1:** `/api?class=1A`
*   **Example URL 2:** `/api?class=1A&class=1B`
*   **API URL Endpoint (User Input/Example):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **CORS Mention:** `CORS`
*   **Error Message (Exact Transcription):**
    ```
    Error: Response [{"studentId":113,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":206,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":231,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":246,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":355,"class":"11E"},{"studentId":507,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":548,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":558,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":586,"class":"11E"},{"studentId":879,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":946,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1105,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":1236,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1489,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1555,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":1689,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1812,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":1817,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1859,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1883,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1978,"class":"11E"}] does not match expected [{"studentId":202,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":304,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":367,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":497,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":551,"class":"11E"},{"studentId":592,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":613,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":746,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":955,"class":"11E"},{"studentId":995,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1023,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1284,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1363,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":1399,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":1474,"class":"11E"},{"studentId":1544,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1608,"class":"11E"},{"studentId":1750,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1761,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1782,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":1792,"class":"8H"},{"studentId":1882,"class":"8H"}]
    ```
*   **Next Step Hint:** `?class=...`*



The /api is working perfectly fine manually either I specify the class or without it  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser window showing the output of an API endpoint, likely from a local development server. The content is formatted as JSON, which is indicated by the "Pretty-print" title in the browser tab, suggesting a browser extension or built-in feature is rendering the raw JSON in a more readable format.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

*   **URL/Endpoint:** The browser's address bar shows `127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
    *   `127.0.0.1` indicates a local machine (localhost).
    *   `8000` is a common port for development servers.
    *   `/api` suggests an API endpoint.

*   **Data Format:** The data is in **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** format.

*   **Data Structure:**
    *   The entire content is a single JSON object.
    *   This object contains one key: `"students"`.
    *   The value associated with `"students"` is a large **array (list) of JSON objects**.
    *   Each object within the `"students"` array represents a single student and has two key-value pairs:
        *   `"studentID"`: An integer representing a unique student identifier (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., up to at least `250`).
        *   `"class"`: A string representing the class or section the student is assigned to (e.g., `"10J"`, `"7K"`, `"2G"`, `"4W"`). These are alphanumeric codes.

*   **Content Description:** The data provides a mapping of student IDs to their respective class assignments. From the visible data, there are at least 250 student entries, with `studentID` ranging from `1` to `250`. This dataset would be typical in a data science or programming course for practicing data parsing, manipulation, or database interaction.

*   **No Error Messages or Commands:** There are no visible error messages or command-line inputs in this screenshot; it shows a successful retrieval and display of data from the API.

Sample class example that I tried manually is below  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web browser window showing the successful response from a local API endpoint, likely part of a data science or web development project.

Here's the key information:

**1. API Endpoint / Command:**
The URL in the browser's address bar indicates a GET request to a local server:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`

*   `127.0.0.1`: This is the localhost IP address, meaning the server is running on the user's own machine.
*   `:8000`: This is a common port number for local development servers.
*   `/api`: This suggests an API endpoint.
*   `?class=3Q`: This is a query parameter, indicating that the API is being asked to return data specifically for "class 3Q".

**2. API Response / Output:**
The main content area shows the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response received from the API. The "Pretty-print" label suggests that the browser or an extension is formatting the JSON for readability.

The transcribed JSON output is:
```json
{"students":[{"studentId":68,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":838,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":902,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1096,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1623,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1784,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1834,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1893,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1931,"class":"3Q"}]}
```

*   **Structure:** The JSON is an object with a single key, `"students"`, whose value is an array of objects.
*   **Data Content:** Each object within the `students` array represents a student. Each student object has two key-value pairs:
    *   `"studentId"`: A unique identifier for the student (e.g., 68, 838, etc.).
    *   `"class"`: The class the student belongs to, which is consistently `"3Q"` for all students listed, matching the query parameter.

**3. System Information & Context:**

*   **Operating System:** Windows, indicated by the taskbar icons and design.
*   **Resource Usage:** The taskbar shows high system resource usage:
    *   CPU: 90%
    *   GPU: 25%
    *   RAM: 97%
    This high RAM usage, in particular, could be a point of concern or discussion in a forum, as it might indicate a memory leak, a large dataset being processed, or other demanding applications running in the background.
*   **Date & Time:** `22:46 02-02-2025` (10:46 PM on February 2, 2025).
*   **Open Tabs/Bookmarks:** The browser has many open tabs and bookmarks, suggesting the user is actively engaged in development and learning. Relevant tabs include "Docker Hub," "My Dashboard," "TDS 2025" (likely a course or conference), "API fetch," "llama.cpp" (related to large language models), and bookmarks like "AI," "CS50," "Programming," "Hack2skill," and "NPTEL." This implies the user is a student or developer working on projects related to data science, AI, and backend development.

In summary, the screenshot shows a successful API call fetching student data for a specific class from a local development server, with the system experiencing high resource utilization.*



The main code is below

```
import sys


sys.path.append("C:\\Users\\Deveshu Pathak\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python312\\Scripts")
# tds_q9.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  
    allow_headers=["*"],  
)

# Load CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("q-fastapi.csv")

@app.get("/api")
def get_students(class_: list[str] = Query(None, alias="class")):
    if class_:
        filtered_df = df[df["class"].isin(class_)]
    else:
        filtered_df = df

    # Convert to dictionary list
    students = filtered_df.to_dict(orient="records")
    return {"students": students}

```

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

I had submitted the assignment in the evening, but now in the portal it’s showing not submitted.  



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a description of the key information presented:

This screenshot displays a "Recent saves" section, likely part of an interactive assignment or coding environment within a data science course. It allows a student to view and revert to previous versions of their work, accompanied by an associated score.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The section lists the user's recent saved states or submissions for a particular task or assignment. This is crucial for students to track progress, revisit previous attempts, or potentially analyze how different iterations of their code performed.
2.  **Save Details:** Each entry provides the following information:
    *   **Timestamp:** The exact date and time when the save was made (e.g., `02/02/2025, 18:21:07`). The dates are consistent (all February 2nd, 2025), and the times suggest sequential saves.
    *   **Score:** A numerical score associated with that particular save (e.g., `Score: 10`, `Score: 8.5`). This strongly indicates an automated evaluation or grading system, where students receive immediate feedback on the performance of their code or model at the time of saving. A score of 10 appears to be the maximum or a perfect score, while 8.5 indicates partial correctness or a less optimal solution.
3.  **Functionality:** Each saved entry is accompanied by a "Reload" button. This button likely allows the user to load the specific state of their work (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script, or project files) that corresponds to that particular save point. This is invaluable for debugging, comparing different approaches, or continuing from a known good state.
4.  **Order:** The saves appear to be listed in reverse chronological order based on the time, with the most recent save at the top.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is no code, commands, or error messages present. The visible text elements are:

*   **Header:** `Recent saves`
*   **Entry 1:**
    *   Button Text: `Reload`
    *   Text Content: `from 02/02/2025, 18:21:07. Score: 10`
*   **Entry 2:**
    *   Button Text: `Reload`
    *   Text Content: `from 02/02/2025, 18:20:57. Score: 10`
*   **Entry 3:**
    *   Button Text: `Reload`
    *   Text Content: `from 02/02/2025, 16:45:08. Score: 8.5`*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, specifically displaying information related to an assignment within a module.

We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

I saved my responses before deadline but still my GA2 didn’t got evaluated  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of an online quiz or assignment interface from a data science course, likely from IIT Madras, given the email domain.

Here's the key information:

*   **Quiz/Assignment Status:**
    *   The activity "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST", indicating a past deadline.
    *   The current displayed "Score: 0".
    *   Available actions are "Check all" and "Save" buttons.

*   **Quiz Instruction/Problem:**
    *   A specific instruction numbered "7." is provided:
        ```
        7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.
        ```
        This is a highly unusual and significant instruction, suggesting that the quiz incorporates a challenge where participants are explicitly permitted to inspect, manipulate, or "hack" the underlying code to discover answers for certain questions. This implies a focus on practical coding, debugging, or reverse-engineering skills.

*   **Discussion/Support:**
    *   A section prompting: "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" is visible, providing a link to a forum or community platform for support.

*   **User Account Information:**
    *   The user is logged in as: `23f2005327@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`
    *   A "Logout" button is available.

*   **Recent Saves:**
    *   A "Recent saves" section is present.
    *   It shows a previous save made: "from 02/02/2025, 21:49:25. Score: 5.5". This indicates that the user previously had a score of 5.5, which is higher than the currently displayed score of 0, and a "Reload" button is available to revert to this saved state.*

    Score: 0
    ```
*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   `Check all`: This button likely triggers a validation or grading process for the entire assignment.
    *   `Save`: This button allows the user to save their current progress.

**2. Support & Community:**
*   **Discussion Forum Link:** There's a direct invitation to seek help or engage with peers:
    ```
    Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse
