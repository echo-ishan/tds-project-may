The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  
I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

And got the following output:

```
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

```

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, presented as an expert in data science course forums:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Content Type:** The screenshot displays a set of four multiple-choice options, typically seen in quizzes, polls, or selections within a web-based learning environment (like a learning management system or an interactive notebook).
2.  **Format of Options:** Each option is a string enclosed in single quotes, following the pattern: `'[Feature Name]: [Numerical Value]'`.
3.  **Data Science Context:**
    *   The "Feature Names" ('Mileage', 'AvgDistance', 'EngineCapacity') are highly indicative of variables or features found in a tabular dataset, common in data science and machine learning. These appear to be related to vehicle characteristics.
    *   The "Numerical Values" are floating-point numbers ranging from -0.05 to 0.95. This range and format strongly suggest:
        *   **Model Coefficients/Weights:** From a regression model (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression), where the value indicates the strength and direction of a feature's relationship with the target variable.
        *   **Feature Importance Scores:** From machine learning models (e.g., tree-based models like Random Forest, XGBoost), indicating the relative contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.
        *   **Correlation Coefficients:** Such as Pearson correlation, which range from -1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
4.  **User Interaction:** One of the options, specifically `'AvgDistance: -0.05'`, is currently selected, as indicated by the filled blue radio button. This implies that the user has made a choice or that this option is highlighted as the correct answer or a default selection.
5.  **Likely Purpose:** The user is likely being asked to identify a specific feature's coefficient/importance/correlation, or to select an option based on a particular criterion (e.g., "Which feature has the strongest positive impact?", "Which feature has the smallest absolute coefficient?").

**Transcription (Code, Commands, or Error Messages):**

There are no code, commands, or error messages present. The visible text represents options in a user interface:

*   'Mileage: 0.95'
*   'AvgDistance: -0.05' (This option is selected)
*   'Mileage: 0.21'
*   'EngineCapacity: 0.17'*



Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

and got the following answers:

```
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

```

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a multiple-choice question, likely from an online data science course or forum, presenting a set of statistical or model-related values for different features.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Format:** The options are presented as radio buttons, indicating that only one choice can be selected. Each option consists of a string literal enclosed in single quotes, following the pattern `'FeatureName: Value'`.
2.  **Content Interpretation:**
    *   The "FeatureName" refers to a variable or characteristic of a dataset (e.g., `Mileage`, `AvgDistance`, `EngineCapacity`).
    *   The "Value" is a numerical float, ranging from -0.08 to 0.95.
    *   Given the context of a data science course, these values most commonly represent:
        *   **Correlation coefficients:** Indicating the strength and direction of a linear relationship between the named feature and another variable (often a target variable). For instance, 'Mileage: 0.95' would suggest a very strong positive correlation, while 'AvgDistance: -0.06' indicates a very weak negative correlation.
        *   **Regression coefficients:** From a linear model, showing the estimated change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable (feature), holding other variables constant.
        *   **Feature importance scores:** Less likely due to the presence of negative values (as most feature importance metrics are non-negative), but possible in certain advanced or normalized contexts (e.g., permutation importance where a negative value implies the feature is detrimental to the model).
3.  **User Interaction:** One of the radio buttons is selected, indicating the user's chosen answer.
4.  **Observation on 'Mileage':** Notably, the feature 'Mileage' appears twice with different values (0.95 and 0.24). This could be part of the question's design, asking the user to identify a specific coefficient or correlation (e.g., "Which is the *correct* coefficient for Mileage in our final model?", or "Which coefficient represents the simple correlation vs. the multiple regression coefficient?").

**Transcription of Options (Exactly as they appear):**

*   'Mileage: 0.95'
*   'AvgDistance: -0.06'
*   'Mileage: 0.24' (This option is selected)
*   'EngineCapacity: -0.08'*

I used a python script to get the solution to quesiton 1 of week 6 graded assignment. It matches three options. Is this a bug or like we then need to analyze using the pearson coefficient to determine which option is the correct one  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a multiple-choice question from a data science or business analytics course, focusing on a real-world application of statistical analysis.

**Key Information:**

*   **Question Context:** The user is asked to assume the role of a strategic consultant for a premium motorcycle dealership chain.
*   **Objective:** Analyze key factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Delhi.
*   **Specific Focus:** Evaluate the impact of three independent variables on "price retention (%)" for **Yamaha** motorcycles.
*   **Independent Variables:**
    1.  Mileage (km/l)
    2.  Average daily distance traveled
    3.  Engine capacity
*   **Dependent Variable:** Price retention (%), which is explicitly defined as `(resale price / original price)`.
*   **Methodology:** The task requires the use of the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** to determine the impact. This implies the options provided are potential correlation values.
*   **Question Format:** It's a multiple-choice question with four options, each presenting a variable name and a numerical value (presumably its Pearson correlation coefficient with price retention).
*   **Selected Answer:** One option, `'EngineCapacity: 0.13'`, is currently selected by the user or pre-selected by the system. This indicates a potential answer for the correlation of engine capacity with price retention.
*   **Points:** The question is worth "1 point".

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages (as they appear):**

There are no traditional code, commands, or error messages. The relevant text elements are the question prompt and the answer options.

**Question Prompt:**

```

Dear TDS Team,

There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support.

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.

For instance:

My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

My question 9 for GA6 is :  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum displays Python code executed in an interactive environment (likely Jupyter Notebook), focused on calculating and ordering geographical distances.

### Key Information:

1.  **Objective:** The code defines coordinates for several "communities" and a "central command post," calculates the great-circle distance between each community and the command post, and then sorts the communities by their distance to determine an "optimal evacuation sequence."
2.  **Library Used:** The `haversine` library is imported and specifically the `haversine` function is used. This function is typically employed to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (like Earth) given their latitudes and longitudes.
3.  **Data Definition:**
    *   Five points are defined as tuples of `(latitude, longitude)`: `OakParkTown`, `EastSpringsSettlement`, `EastFieldsJunction`, `RedPointTown`, and `CentralCommandPostLocation`.
4.  **Distance Calculation:**
    *   A dictionary named `distances` stores the calculated distances. The keys are the community names (strings), and the values are the distances computed using `haversine()` for each community relative to `CentralCommandPostLocation`.
5.  **Sorting Logic:**
    *   The `sorted()` function is used to create `optimal_sequence`. It sorts the *keys* of the `distances` dictionary (community names) based on their corresponding *values* (distances) in ascending order, effectively arranging communities from closest to furthest from the command post.
6.  **Output Formatting:**
    *   The code iterates through the sorted communities using `enumerate` (starting count from 1) and prints each community's rank, name, and its calculated distance from the central command post, formatted to two decimal places and appended with "km".
7.  **No Errors:** The code executed successfully, producing the desired output.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Output:

```python
In [26]: from haversine import haversine

# Define the coordinates of each community and the central command post
OakParkTown = (27.0096, -72.3822)
EastSpringsSettlement = (27.0769, -72.394)
EastFieldsJunction = (27.0961, -72.4248)
RedPointTown = (26.9874, -72.426)
CentralCommandPostLocation = (27.0552, -72.4893)

# Calculate the distances between each community and the central command post
distances = {
    "OakParkTown": haversine(OakParkTown, CentralCommandPostLocation),
    "EastSpringsSettlement": haversine(EastSpringsSettlement, CentralCommandPostLocation),
    "EastFieldsJunction": haversine(EastFieldsJunction, CentralCommandPostLocation),
    "RedPointTown": haversine(RedPointTown, CentralCommandPostLocation)
}

# Sort the communities based on their distances to the central command post
optimal_sequence = sorted(distances, key=distances.get)

# Print the optimal evacuation sequence
for i, community in enumerate(optimal_sequence, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {community} - Distance: {distances[community]:.2f} km")
```

**Output:**

```
1. EastFieldsJunction - Distance: 7.84 km
2. EastSpringsSettlement - Distance: 9.74 km
3. RedPointTown - Distance: 9.81 km
4. OakParkTown - Distance: 11.76 km
```*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course, likely an interactive environment like a Jupyter notebook, given the `[26]` cell number. It presents a multiple-choice question related to a geographical optimization problem.

Here's the key information:

**Key Information:**

*   **Question Number:** 9
*   **Points:** 1 point
*   **Problem Type:** Geographical pathfinding/optimization (specifically, an evacuation strategy).
*   **Scenario:** There are four communities and a Central Command Post, each with specified latitude and longitude coordinates.
*   **Goal:** Determine the optimal evacuation sequence for the communities.
*   **Strategy:** "Nearest community first" evacuation strategy. This means at each step, the next community to be evacuated is the one currently closest to the current location (which could be the Central Command Post initially, and then the last evacuated community). The "shortest path distance" implies a great-circle distance calculation between geographical coordinates.
*   **Locations and Coordinates:**
    *   Oak Park Town: (27.0096, -72.3822)
    *   East Springs Settlement: (27.0769, -72.394)

Hello Sir,

Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir we should select the absolute maximum value.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays a multiple-choice question from an online quiz or assignment related to data analysis and correlation.

1.  **Question Context:** The user is acting as a strategic consultant for a motorcycle dealership. The objective is to analyze factors influencing motorcycle resale value (specifically, price retention) for Royal Enfield bikes in Uttar Pradesh.
2.  **Analytical Method:** The task explicitly requires using the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** to evaluate the impact of three variables:
    *   Mileage (km/l)
    *   Average daily distance traveled
    *   Engine capacity
3.  **Dependent Variable:** "Price retention (%)" is defined as "(resale price / original price)". This is the variable whose relationship with the independent factors needs to be assessed.
4.  **User Attempt:** The user selected the option `'AvgDistance: -0.13'`.
5.  **Feedback:** The selected answer was incorrect, and the user received a score of 0 points for this question.
6.  **Correct Answer:** The system indicates that the correct answer is `'EngineCapacity: 0.09'`.
7.  **Possible Distractor:** Notably, there are two options for 'EngineCapacity' with different correlation values (0.95 and 0.09), suggesting the importance of accurate calculation or interpretation of the correlation.

**Transcribed Information (Code, Commands, and Error Messages):**

*   **Question Prompt:**
    ```
    1) As a strategic consultant for a premium motorcycle dealership chain, your objective is to analyze the key factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Uttar Pradesh. Specifically, you will evaluate the impact of mileage (km/l), average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention (%) for Royal Enfield. Use Pearson Correlation Coefficient and price retention is (resale price / original price).
    ```
*   **Points:**
    ```
    1 point
    ```
*   **Options (as they appear, with single quotes):**
    ```
    'Mileage: 0.01'
    'EngineCapacity: 0.95'
    'AvgDistance: -0.13'
    'EngineCapacity: 0.09'
    ```
*   **Error Message/Feedback:**
    ```
    No, the answer is incorrect.
    ```
*   **Score:**
    ```
    Score: 0
    ```
*   **Accepted Answers Label:**
    ```
    Accepted Answers:
    ```
*   **Correct Answer (as it appears, with single quotes):**
    ```
    'EngineCapacity: 0.09'
    ```*



Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum.

For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,  



> **Image Content:** *This image displays a **correlation heatmap**, a common visualization in data science to show the pairwise correlation between different variables in a dataset.

**Key Information:**

*   **Plot Type:** Correlation Heatmap.
*   **Variables:**
    *   **Rows & Columns:** The variables are the same for both rows and columns, which is typical for a correlation matrix.
        *   Mileage (km/l)
        *   Avg Daily Distance (km)
        *   Engine Capacity (cc)
        *   Price Retention (%)
*   **Correlation Values:** The numbers within each cell represent the Pearson correlation coefficient between the corresponding row and column variables.
    *   Values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation).
    *   A value of 0 indicates no linear correlation.
*   **Color Scheme:** A diverging colormap (likely 'coolwarm' or similar) is used:
    *   **Red (darker):** Strong positive correlation (e.g., 1.00).
    *   **Blue (darker):** Strong negative correlation (e.g., -0.13, though this is a weak negative).
    *   **Lighter Blue/White:** Correlations close to zero.
*   **Diagonal:** The diagonal elements are all 1.00 (red), which is expected as a variable is perfectly correlated with itself.
*   **Symmetry:** The heatmap is symmetric, meaning the correlation between A and B is the same as between B and A. Only the lower or upper triangle (plus the diagonal) is typically needed for full information, but this one shows the full matrix.

**Interpretation of Correlations (from visible data):**

*   **Engine Capacity (cc) vs. Engine Capacity (cc):** 1.00 (Self-correlation)
*   **Price Retention (%) vs. Price Retention (%):** 1.00 (Self-correlation)
*   **Engine Capacity (cc) vs. Mileage (km/l):** 0.01 (Very weak positive correlation)
*   **Engine Capacity (cc) vs. Avg Daily Distance (km):** 0.04 (Very weak positive correlation)
*   **Engine Capacity (cc) vs. Price Retention (%):** 0.09 (Weak positive correlation)
*   **Price Retention (%) vs. Mileage (km/l):** 0.01 (Very weak positive correlation)
*   **Price Retention (%) vs. Avg Daily Distance (km):** -0.13 (Weak negative correlation)
*   **Price Retention (%) vs. Engine Capacity (cc):** 0.09 (Weak positive correlation)

**Exact Transcriptions:**

**Row Labels:**
*   Engine Capacity (cc)
*   Price Retention (%)

**Column Labels:**
*   Mileage (km/l)
*   Avg Daily Distance (km)
*   Engine Capacity (cc)
*   Price Retention (%)

**Cell Values (from visible portions):**
*   0.01 (under "Mileage (km/l)", next to "Engine Capacity (cc)")
*   0.04 (under "Avg Daily Distance (km)", next to "Engine Capacity (cc)")
*   1.00 (under "Engine Capacity (cc)", next to "Engine Capacity (cc)")
*   0.09 (under "Price Retention (%)", next to "Engine Capacity (cc)")
*   0.01 (under "Mileage (km/l)", next to "Price Retention (%)")
*   -0.13 (under "Avg Daily Distance (km)", next to "Price Retention (%)")
*   0.09 (under "Engine Capacity (cc)", next to "Price Retention (%)")
*   1.00 (under "Price Retention (%)", next to "Price Retention (%)")

**Color Bar Values (visible):**
*   0.6
*   0.4
*   0.2
*   0.0*



So shouldn’t it be -0.13?

Thanks for the colour picture.  
If you read the aforementioned email…  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email or forum announcement from a data science course, specifically providing a clarification regarding a graded assignment.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Sender and Recipient:** The message is from `donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in` and is addressed to an announcement list `to 25t1_se2002-announce`, indicating an official communication channel for a specific batch or course.
2.  **Subject:** The subject line `[TDS Jan 25] GA 6 Clarification` specifies that the email is related to "The Data Science" course, sent on January 25th, and provides clarification for "Graded Assignment 6".
3.  **Problem Identified:** The course instructors acknowledge that "GA6 Question 1 and 2 were not very clear in what was expected." This indicates an ambiguity in the assignment instructions for these specific questions.
4.  **Clarification on Expected Answer:** The core clarification states: "The answer we are looking for is the Absolute Maximum Correlation Coefficient." This defines the precise metric or value students should have used to answer the questions.
5.  **Illustrative Example:** An example is provided to illustrate the clarification: "eg. If you find -0.3 and 0.2 as the matching options. The correct answer is -0.3". This shows that when comparing `0.2` and `-0.3`, even though `0.2` is numerically larger, `-0.3` has a larger *absolute* value (`|-0.3| = 0.3` vs `|0.2| = 0.2`), thus making `-0.3` the "Absolute Maximum Correlation Coefficient".
6.  **Grading Reassurance:** A critical piece of information (highlighted by a red box) is the assurance: "Do not worry if the portal marks you as being incorrect. We will still push the right scores on the dashboard if you chose the correct option." This indicates that the automated grading system on the course portal might not correctly interpret answers based on this clarification. Students are assured that their scores will be manually reviewed and updated to reflect correct answers based on the clarified instructions, preventing misgraded submissions from negatively impacting their official scores.

**Transcribed Text:**

**Subject:** `[TDS Jan 25] GA 6 Clarification`
**From:** `donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in`
**To:** `to 25t1_se2002-announce`

`Dear Learner,`

`GA6 Question 1 and 2 were not very clear in what was expected.`

Thank you sir. i have got questions 1 and 2 both marked as 0.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a multiple-choice question from an online data science course or quiz, focusing on a business case study involving correlation analysis.

Here's the key information:

**1. Problem Statement / Question (1 point):**
The question asks the user to act as a strategic consultant for a premium motorcycle dealership chain in Maharashtra. The objective is to analyze key factors influencing motorcycle resale value, specifically for KTM motorcycles.
The task is to evaluate the impact of three factors:
    *   mileage (km/l)
    *   average daily distance traveled
    *   engine capacity
on "price retention (%)."
The method specified is to "Use Pearson Correlation Coefficient."
"price retention" is defined as "(resale price / original price)."

**2. Multiple-Choice Options:**
There are four options provided, each appearing to represent a variable and its calculated Pearson Correlation Coefficient with price retention. The user's selected answer is indicated by the filled radio button next to the first option.

*   `'AvgDistance: 0.01'` (This was the user's selected answer)
*   `'Mileage: 0.03'`
*   `'EngineCapacity: -0.06'`
*   `'Mileage: 0.95'`

**3. Feedback on User's Attempt:**
The system provides immediate feedback indicating the user's answer was incorrect.

*   **Error Message:** `No, the answer is incorrect.`
*   **Score:** `Score: 0`

**4. Accepted Answer:**
The correct answer is revealed after the user's attempt.

*   **Accepted Answers Heading:** `Accepted Answers:`
*   **Correct Answer:** `'Mileage: 0.03'`

**Summary of Key Information:**
The question tests the user's ability to interpret or calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficients between specific features (mileage, average daily distance, engine capacity) and a target variable (price retention) in a real-world data science scenario. The user incorrectly selected `'AvgDistance: 0.01'`, while the correct answer was `'Mileage: 0.03'`. This implies that, among the options provided, 'Mileage' with a correlation of `0.03` is the expected correct answer, suggesting either a pre-calculated value or a task that required the user to perform this calculation.*



In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect

My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)

Also, my question 4 was :  
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.

134483

94774

150666

199711

Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect

So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)

Kindly look into it

Thanks and Regards
