The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I‚Äôm unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  
I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

And got the following output:

```
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

```

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  



> **Image:** The image presents a multiple-choice selection interface displaying feature importances. The radio button next to "'AvgDistance: -0.05'" is currently selected. Other options include "'Mileage: 0.95'", "'Mileage: 0.21'", and "'EngineCapacity: 0.17'". The negative value for 'AvgDistance' could be a point of interest or potential issue if feature importances are expected to be positive. No code or error messages are visible, only the values associated with each feature.



Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

and got the following answers:

```
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

```

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a set of radio button options representing feature values. The options are: `'Mileage: 0.95'`, `'AvgDistance: -0.06'`, `'Mileage: 0.24'`, and `'EngineCapacity: -0.08'`. The option `'Mileage: 0.24'` is currently selected. This suggests the user is making a selection based on feature values, possibly in a model explainability or feature importance context. No code snippets, error messages, data visualizations, or further textual details are visible.

I used a python script to get the solution to quesiton 1 of week 6 graded assignment. It matches three options. Is this a bug or like we then need to analyze using the pearson coefficient to determine which option is the correct one  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a multiple-choice question from a data science course, asking the user to identify a key factor influencing motorcycle resale value in Delhi. The question states that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient should be used and price retention is defined as resale price divided by original price. The available choices include variables "Mileage", "AvgDistance" and "EngineCapacity" with associated correlation values.  The radio button next to "'EngineCapacity: 0.13'" is currently selected. This selection appears to be evaluating the relationships between these factors and price retention.

In GA6 for first 2 questions 3 out of 4 options are correct. Even the question is not clearly asking anything. Kindly suggest are we supposed to select the wrong one  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a multiple-choice question in a data science context, likely related to Pearson correlation. The question asks to evaluate the impact of mileage, average daily distance and engine capacity on price retention. Four options display correlation values for different features: 'AvgDistance: 0.09', 'Mileage: 0.95', 'EngineCapacity: -0.02', and 'Mileage: 0.12'. The UI shows a radio button selection indicating that the 'Mileage: 0.95' option has been selected. No code or error messages are present.

Dear TDS Team,

There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support.

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.

For instance:

> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) - Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer. The answer is coming to around 11.5 kms which is 11500 meters.  
Q.A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Pine Pines Junction : (26.5596,-99.5336) ;Maple Fields Station : (26.4212,-99.4597);South Glen Crossing : (26.5962,-99.5243);Cedar Creek Retreat : (26.56,-99.4519) & Central Command Post Location: (26.4644,-99.4771) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

> **Image:** The code calculates and sorts distances between different locations using the `haversine` function. Location coordinates are defined as tuples and stored in variables. A dictionary called `distances` maps location names to distances calculated using `haversine`. The `sorted` function is used to arrange locations based on their distance from `CentralCommandPostLocation`. The output displays a ranked list of locations and their corresponding distances in kilometers, formatted to two decimal places (e.g., "1. EastFieldsJunction - Distance: 7.84 km").



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a multiple-choice question from a data science course, asking for the optimal evacuation sequence of four communities based on a "nearest community first" strategy. The geographical coordinates of the communities (Oak Park Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, Red Point Town) and the central command post are provided. A Python code snippet imports the `haversine` library and initializes the coordinates of `OakParkTown`, suggesting the use of this library to calculate distances. The task involves determining the sequence that minimizes the total travel distance between the command post and the communities. There are no explicit error messages or data visualizations.

Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir we should select the absolute maximum value.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a multiple-choice question from a data science course focusing on factors influencing motorcycle resale value using Pearson correlation. The question asks for the correlation coefficient, and the user selected "'AvgDistance: -0.13'", which was marked incorrect. The UI indicates the user's "Score: 0" and provides the correct answer: "'EngineCapacity: 0.09'".  The question tests understanding of how mileage, average distance, and engine capacity impact price retention. No data visualizations or code snippets are visible.



Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it‚Äôs absolut value is maximum.

For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a correlation matrix visualized as a heatmap. The matrix shows the correlation coefficients between four variables: "Mileage (km/l)", "Avg Daily Distance (km)", "Engine Capacity (cc)", and "Price Retention (%)". The correlation values range from -0.13 to 1.00, displayed within the heatmap cells, colored based on the correlation strength. High positive correlations (1.00) are observed along the diagonal, indicating the self-correlation of each variable. Lower values (e.g., 0.01) suggest a very weak relationship between variables like Mileage and Engine Capacity.



So shouldn‚Äôt it be -0.13?

Thanks for the colour picture.  
If you read the aforementioned email‚Ä¶  



> **Image:** The screenshot is an email clarification for a data science course (TDS Jan 25) regarding GA6, specifically questions 1 and 2. It states that the expected answer involves the "Absolute Maximum Correlation Coefficient."  An example is provided: If -0.3 and 0.2 are options, -0.3 is the correct answer.  The email informs learners that the portal might incorrectly mark answers, but the correct scores will be manually pushed to the dashboard. There are no charts or code visible, focusing solely on the problem description and resolution for an assessment.



Kind regards (in colour )

Thank you sir. i have got questions 1 and 2 both marked as 0.  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a multiple-choice question from a data science course, specifically focusing on the correlation between motorcycle resale value and mileage. The task is to identify the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.  The user's answer was incorrect, indicated by the message "No, the answer is incorrect." and a score of "0". The correct answer, as specified, is "'Mileage: 0.03'".



In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states.  
I have used excel to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient. Below the values I got for each question. Please verify.

|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for Karnataka||  
-0.026685695

|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||  
0.003953219

|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||  
-0.010839295

|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for maharashta||  
0.029128825

|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||  
0.013019585

|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||  
-0.056866212

Dear sirs,  
I have question no 7 got marked as 0. Please check the question below and the haversine distance for the given post comes to around 11.5 kms which is not matccing with any of the options and I have selected the closest answer. please check and let me know.  



> **Image:** The screenshot is from an online quiz related to data science focusing on spatial analysis. The quiz question asks to calculate the distance between "Central Command Post" (26.4644,-99.4771) and "Pine Pines Junction" (26.5596,-99.5336) using the Haversine package. The user selected "6265 meters", but the feedback shows "No, the answer is incorrect" and the score is 0. The correct answer, according to "Accepted Answers:", is "5106 meters." The UI elements include radio buttons for selecting answer choices and a textual display of the question/feedback.

I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect

My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would‚Äôve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn‚Äôt the case with this question)

Also, my question 4 was :  
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.

134483

94774

150666

199711

Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect

So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren‚Äôt pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)

Kindly look into it

Thanks and Regards

In Q4 , neither which regression model to use is given nor the what random state to use is given. I tried linear regression, random forest regression but it is giving answer which vary each time I compute, also, the option values are quite close.



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a multiple-choice question from a data science course, specifically about forecasting motorcycle resale values. The question asks to predict the 2027 resale value of a "Hero - HF Deluxe in Punjab" using historical data. The student selected "142646" as the answer, but it's marked incorrect with the message "No, the answer is incorrect." The current score is "Score: 0," suggesting this is an assessment or quiz.
