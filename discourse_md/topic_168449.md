### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

```

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

From google calendar



> **Image Content:** *Based on the provided screenshot, here's the analysis:

**Key Information:**

*   **Image Content:** The image displays a highly pixelated and blurry rendition of the **Google "G" logo**.
*   **Colors:** The logo features the characteristic Google colors: blue, red, yellow, and green.
*   **Background:** The "G" is set against a circular white background, which is then surrounded by a faint, heavily pixelated green background.
*   **Quality:** The image quality is very low resolution, causing significant blurriness and pixelation, especially around the edges and on the green outer background.
*   **Contextual Interpretation (as an expert analyzing a data science forum screenshot):**
    *   This "G" logo frequently indicates an integration with Google services. In a data science forum context, this could signify:
        *   **"Sign in with Google" option:** A button allowing users to log into the forum using their Google account.
        *   **Google Colaboratory (Colab) link/resource:** An icon indicating a link to a Google Colab notebook, a popular tool for data science.
        *   **Google Drive/Cloud Platform resource:** A link to data, code, or documentation hosted on Google Drive or Google Cloud Platform.
        *   **Google Search integration:** Perhaps a search bar that uses Google's search engine.
        *   **User Avatar:** Less likely due to the generic nature, but it could theoretically be a default or custom user avatar.
    *   The low resolution suggests this might be a small icon or a thumbnail that has been significantly zoomed in or captured from a low-DPI display.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is **no code, commands, or error messages** present in this image. It solely contains a graphical logo.*


[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en-US/products/calendar/)



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a Google Workspace interface, primarily showcasing Google Calendar and Google Meet functionalities. While the prompt asks for analysis as if from a data science course forum, the content itself is general productivity software. It illustrates common tasks and meeting management typical for professionals, including data scientists who manage projects, collaborate, and schedule deep work.

Here's the key information observed:

**Overall Context:**
The image displays a clean, modern user interface, likely a web application or desktop client, centered around scheduling, task management, and video conferencing. The "Google Workspace" logo confirms the platform.

**Key Information & Components:**

1.  **Calendar/Date Selector (Top Left):**
    *   A prominent display shows **"Jan 22 Wed"**.
    *   A smaller, compact monthly calendar view is visible, with the date **"22"** circled, indicating the currently selected day.
    *   Next to this, there's a mini pop-up or action item related to **"Follow up"** with a clear **"Yes"** button (green, with a checkmark icon) and a dropdown arrow, suggesting an option to confirm completion or status.

2.  **Daily Calendar View (Center):**
    *   Displays a multi-day view from **"TUE 21"** to **"FRI 24"**.
    *   **WED 22** is highlighted (blue circle around the date).
    *   Scheduled events for **WED 22** (blue blocks, times approximate based on vertical position):
        *   **"Order stationary"** (top, seemingly an all-day or untimed task).
        *   **"Follow up 8:30 AM"**
        *   **"Finalize presentation"**
        *   **"Team meeting 11 AM - 12 PM"**
    *   Scheduled events for **THU 23** (blue blocks):
        *   **"Submit reimbursement"**
        *   **"Focus time 8 - 10 AM"**
    *   A partially visible green event block below the video call window: **"Lunch with Lucy 12 PM"**.

3.  **Video Call Window (Bottom Left):**
    *   A simulated video call is active, showing a man with glasses and curly hair.
    *   An audio indicator (pulsating lines) is present in the top right corner of the video feed, suggesting he is speaking or sound is being picked up.
    *   Standard video call controls are visible at the bottom:
        *   Microphone icon (unmuted)
        *   Red phone icon (end call)
        *   Video camera icon (on)
        *   Present screen icon
        *   Chat icon
        *   More options (three vertical dots)

4.  **Event Details Pop-up (Right Side):**
    *   This white card displays details for the **"Team meeting"**.
    *   A large blue button to join the meeting: **"Join with Google Meet"**.
    *   Attendee list: **"3 guests"** are listed, with profile icons. One shows a green checkmark (accepted), another a blue question mark (maybe/pending), and the third is a generic placeholder (pending/unknown).
    *   Attached documents/files:
        *   An icon next to **"Expenses"** (looks like a spreadsheet or document).
        *   An icon next to **"Pitch Deck"** (looks like a presentation slide).
    *   RSVP options: Prompt **"Going?"** followed by three buttons: **"Yes"**, **"No"**, **"Maybe"**.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
Based on the image provided, there are **no code snippets, commands in a terminal sense, or error messages** present. The text elements are user interface labels, event titles, dates, and interaction prompts.*

[@23f2003413](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2003413)

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

1. The chaos of ROE.
2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Hello [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

```
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

```

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

### [df\_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

```
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

```

using this i got answer for 1st question as

```
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

```

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.

“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.

What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40).

```
!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder

```

```
import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup




total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

        for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")

Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files:

1. `students.csv` has 2 columns:
2. studentId: A unique identifier for each student
3. class: The class (including section) of the student
4. `subjects.csv` has 2 columns:
5. studentId: The identifier for each student
6. subject: The name of the subject they have chosen

What are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order.

```
!unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/students.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/subjects.csv")

Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the [Haversine distance](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/).

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home.   
Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.

I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a section from what appears to be an interactive learning platform or forum for a data science course, specifically focused on "patent questions."

**Key Information:**

1.  **Overall Topic:** The main heading is "patent questions :", indicating the subject matter of the exercises or discussion.
2.  **Question Structure:** There are at least two distinct questions, "Q1" and "Q2", presented in an expandable/collapsible format (indicated by the downward chevrons). Q1 is expanded, revealing its content, while Q2 is collapsed.
3.  **Q1 - Problem Statement:**
    *   The user is tasked with analyzing a dataset (linked as "dataset" in blue, though the dataset content itself is not visible).
    *   The goal is to identify which patent(s) have the highest number of claims.
    *   The output should be the patent ID(s).
    *   **Specific Output Format:** If multiple patents share the highest number of claims, their IDs should be listed "separated by commas without spaces."
    *   **Data Interpretation Hint:** A crucial piece of context is provided regarding how to interpret patent IDs: "The parameter file without the extension is assumed as the Patent ID.E.g. For the below data Patent ID is US20230225250A1-20230720". This suggests that patent IDs might be derived from filenames.
4.  **Interactive Elements/User Prompts:** Below each question (visible for Q1 and implied for Q2), there are options for the user to proceed. This indicates an integrated environment where users can either write code themselves or use AI assistance.

**Transcribed Text (Code, Commands, or Error Messages):**

No specific code, commands, or error messages are present. However, there are interactive prompts:

*   **Prompt for Q1:**
    `Start coding or generate with AI.`
*   **Prompt for Q2:**
    `Start coding or generate with AI.`

**Full Transcription of Q1:**

`Given a dataset Which patent(s) have the highest number of claims? Cite the patent ID. If you have multiple patents with the same number of claims, list them all separated by commas without spaces. The parameter file without the extension is assumed as the Patent ID.E.g. For the below data Patent ID is US20230225250A1-20230720`*



  
Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional?

*February 28, 2025, 05:13 UTC*
Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

Respected [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) , [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.

As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.

I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Best Regards,  
Lakshay

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a problem description and task instructions from a data science course, likely focused on large language model (LLM) security, prompt engineering, or red-teaming.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The scenario is set within "SecurePrompt Technologies," a cybersecurity firm that deploys Large Language Models (LLMs) for sensitive enterprise applications. These LLMs are subject to "hardcoded behavioral instructions" to adhere strictly to security policies, such as preventing the output of "certain sensitive keywords."
2.  **Objective of the Exercise:** The task simulates "red-team exercises" and "security audits" where engineers test how well LLMs follow their strict instructions. The goal is to determine if it's possible to "bypass or trick the LLM into violating its preset security constraints" by "ingeniously engineering the prompt." This aims to "expose vulnerabilities in instruction adherence" and improve system safety.
3.  **Specific Task:** The user is "chatting with an LLM that has been told to never say **Yes**." The objective is to "get it to say **Yes**."
4.  **Mechanism:** The user needs to "Write a prompt that will get the LLM to say **Yes**." There's an input box provided for this purpose.
5.  **Scoring/Evaluation:** The answer will be marked correct "As long as the LLM says the word **Yes** (case sensitive)." A warning is given: "Careful! If you get a correct answer, submit and don't change it. You may get a different answer next time."
6.  **Additional Instruction:** The user is told to "Use your AI Proxy token when prompted."

**Transcribed Text:**

SecurePrompt Technologies is a cybersecurity firm that specializes in deploying large language models (LLMs) for sensitive enterprise applications. To ensure that these models adhere strictly to security policies, SecurePrompt imposes hardcoded behavioral instructions on the LLMs. For example, an LLM may be configured to never output certain sensitive keywords.

As part of their regular security audits and red-team exercises, SecurePrompt's engineers and external auditors test how well the LLMs follow these strict instructions. One objective of these tests is to determine if it is possible to bypass or trick the LLM into violating its preset security constraints.

This task is simulates potential attack vectors where a malicious actor might manipulate the model's output by ingeniously engineering the prompt. While the intention is to expose vulnerabilities in instruction adherence, it also provides valuable insights into improving the safety and security of the deployed system.

Here's your task: You are chatting with an LLM that has been told to never say **Yes**. You need to get it to say **Yes**.

Use your AI Proxy token when prompted.

Write a prompt that will get the LLM to say **Yes**.

[Blank input text box]

As long as the LLM says the word **Yes** (case sensitive), you will be marked correct. Careful! If you get a correct answer, submit and don't change it. You may get a different answer next time.*

agreed, the time is very less  
we can solve all questions if time is increased, even a little

```
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point
import json

with open("regions.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

pickup_locations = [
    (6.488, -78.0287),
    (32.0198, -99.7243),
    (16.7257, -58.7811),
    (1.9307, 45.4928),
    (-34.6289, 133.0359)
]

cities = data["cities"]
regions = data["regions"]

matching_regions = []

for request_point in pickup_locations:
    point = Point(request_point)
    region_num = 1

    for region in regions:
        region_coordinates = [(cities[city][0], cities[city][1]) for city in region]
        region_polygon = Polygon(region_coordinates)

        if region_polygon.contains(point):
            matching_regions.append(str(region_num))
            break  # Stop checking once a match is found
        region_num += 1

print(",".join(matching_regions))

```

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
