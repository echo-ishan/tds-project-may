Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

    *   **Due Date:** "2025-01-26, 23:59 IST" (While the message states it has passed, the displayed date is in the future relative to the current year, suggesting this might be a static message or a display artifact after an attempt.)
*   **Submission Policy:** Students can submit "any number of times before the due date." The "final submission will be considered for grading."

**Important Instructions/Troubleshooting for Accessing Assignments:**
The page provides a list of common issues if a student has difficulty accessing graded assignments:
1.  "Ad blockers need to be disabled/removed."
2.  "The site requires cookies for authentication. So any cookie blocking/tracker blocking extensions or software may prevent access."
3.  "Javascript is required for the site to work correctly."
4.  "Chrome Browser is the recommended software to access the contents."
5.  "Disable any browser extensions that may be interfere with the site from working correctly."
6.  "Overly aggressive anti-virus software may also cause similar access problems."

**Critical Grading Requirement:**
*   **Student ID Usage:** "You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation." This is a crucial instruction for ensuring scores are recorded correctly.

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,  
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Hello,  
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Respected Sir,  
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  
Thanks

[@23f2005471](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2005471)

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Kind regards

Respected Sir/Madam,

I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox  
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment  
and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

Dear [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission  



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the key information:

This image displays a question from an online graded assignment or quiz within a data science course.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Question Context:** The question (labeled "1)") is a confirmation check, asking the student if they have viewed and attempted "Graded Assignment 1," providing a hyperlink ("this link") to the assignment itself.
2.  **Question Type:** It is a multiple-choice question with two binary options: "Yes" or "No".
3.  **User's Attempt & Outcome:** The screenshot indicates that the user selected "No" as their answer. This answer was marked as incorrect by the system.
4.  **Scoring:** The student received a score of "0" for this particular question.
5.  **Correct Answer Revelation:** The system explicitly states that the "Accepted Answers" for this question is "Yes." This implies the question is designed to confirm engagement with the assignment, and acknowledging completion (even if not fully done, but at least "seen and attempted") is the expected response to pass this specific check.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Question Text:**
    ```
    1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it.
    ```
*   **Options:**
    ```
    Yes
    No
    ```
*   **Error/Incorrect Feedback Message:**

Good evening, I have submitted my GA1 in the ex website  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

This screenshot displays an assignment or quiz page for a data science course, likely from IIT Madras, given the domain "ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The page provides instructions, guidance, user login information, and recent save history for an assessment that has concluded or is about to conclude.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Assessment Deadline:** The assignment ended (or will end, as the date is in the future relative to current time) on **Sunday, January 26, 2025, at 11:59 pm IST**.

2.  **Assessment Instructions/Policy (Highly Unconventional):**
    *   **Technical Issues:** Students are advised that "Browser may struggle" and should try turning off security restrictions or using a different browser if they face loading issues.
    *   **Open Resources:** Students are explicitly permitted to "Use anything." This includes "The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever," and any "libraries or frameworks you want." This indicates an extremely open-book and collaborative policy, even allowing the use of AI tools.
    *   **"Hackable" Quiz:** Most notably, the quiz is described as "hackable," with the statement: "It's possible to get the answer to *some* questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed." This is a highly unusual instruction for an academic assessment, suggesting that the quiz might be designed to test students' understanding of web technologies, debugging, or even ethical hacking concepts, rather than solely data science theory. It also implies a unique approach to assessment where such "cheating" methods are sanctioned.

3.  **Course Suitability Guidance ("Should you take TDS this term?"):**
    *   **Time Benchmark:** If the assignment takes "under 2 hours to complete," the student will "likely do OK in TDS." This provides a pacing guideline for course success.
    *   **Grade Benchmark:** Scoring "above 8 / 10" on this assignment might lead to an "S or A grade, with effort and luck." This sets expectations for high performance. "TDS" likely refers to "The Data Science" course.

4.  **Discussion Forum Link:** A prominent box encourages students to "Join the discussion on Discourse" if they have questions, indicating the use of Discourse as the course's primary forum.

5.  **User Information:**
    *   The user is logged in as **23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**. This is a student ID from a data science study program at IIT Madras.
    *   A "Logout" button is present.

6.  **Recent Saves/Progress:**
    *   The "Recent saves" section shows the user's past attempts or saves for this assignment.
    *   All listed saves are identical: They were made on **1/26/2025 at 11:59:45 PM** and resulted in a **Score: 9.5**. This indicates the user performed very well (above the 8/10 benchmark for high grades) and submitted/saved their work very close to the deadline.

---

**Transcribed Text (exactly as it appears):**

Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST

5. **Browser may struggle.** If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.
6. **Use anything.** You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.
7. **It's hackable.** It's possible to get the answer to *some* questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.

Should you take TDS this term?

*   If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS.
*   If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a student's post on a data science course forum, seeking assistance with a graded assignment submission. The key information is as follows:

**1. Student's Issue and Request:**
The student states they have "attempted the assignment and also saved my score," but "forgot to just click yes on the other portal." They are requesting that their "submission be evaluated" despite this oversight.

**2. Past Assignment Scores/Attempts:**
The top section shows a history of saved attempts or scores for the assignment, indicating improvement over time:
*   `Reload from 1/26/2025, 12:25:43 PM. Score: 9`
*   `Reload from 1/26/2025, 12:22:01 PM. Score: 8.5`
*   `Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:46:22 AM. Score: 8`
(Note: The dates are in the future, 2025, which may indicate a test environment or placeholder.)

**3. Graded Assignment Confirmation Requirement:**
Below the student's post, an interface element for "Graded Assignment 1" is displayed, which seems to be the "other portal" the student refers to. It includes a critical instruction and a confirmation question:

*   **Crucial Instruction:**
    `You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.`

*   **Confirmation Question:**
    `1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it.`

*   **Options:**
    *   `Yes` (radio button)
    *   `No` (radio button)

*   **Error Message and Current Status:**
    The system indicates the incorrect selection for this confirmation question:
    `No, the answer is incorrect.`
    `Score: 0`

*   **Accepted Answer:**
    The correct answer for this confirmation question is explicitly stated:
    `Accepted Answers:`
    `Yes`

In summary, the student achieved a score of 9 on the actual assignment but failed to complete a required "Yes" confirmation step on a separate portal, which resulted in a "0" score for that specific confirmation question and likely prevented the evaluation of their higher assignment score. They are seeking an exception to allow their score to be considered.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interface for an online assignment or quiz, likely from a data science course, given the nature of the questions. It provides information about the assignment's status, saving history, and the list of questions.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assignment Status and Controls (Top Bar):**
*   **Completion/End Time:** "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 PM IST". This indicates the assignment has either concluded or has a future deadline. The specific date suggests it's a pre-set assignment.
*   **Current Displayed Score:** "Score: 0". This is the score currently shown in the top bar.
*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   "Check": Likely used to submit answers for evaluation or to check progress on the current question/assignment.
    *   "Save": Used to save the current progress without submitting for grading.

**2. Recent Saves (Progress Tracking):**
This section tracks the user's progress and allows reverting to previous states.
*   **Currently Loaded Save:** "Loaded from 1/26/2025, 11:51:50 PM. Score: 6". This indicates that the version of the assignment currently being viewed/worked on was loaded from a save made at this time, and at that point, it had achieved a score of 6 marks.
*   **Previous Saves:**
    *   "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:44:51 PM. Score: 5.5"
    *   "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:44:00 PM. Score: 5.5"
    These are older saves, both with a score of 5.5 marks, indicating the user improved their score to 6 in a later save. The "Reload" button next to them would allow the user to revert to those specific saved states.
*   **Discrepancy:** It's notable that the "Loaded" save has a score of 6, but the "Score:" in the top bar shows "0". This could imply that the top bar score is for the currently unsaved or unchecked state, or perhaps the final submitted score, while the "Recent saves" shows the highest progress achieved in a saved state.

**3. Questions (Assignment Content):**
This section lists 18 distinct questions or tasks, each with an associated mark value, indicating their weighting in the assignment. Each question appears to be a clickable link, suggesting they lead to the specific task details or input fields.

**Transcription of Questions:**

1.  VS Code Version (0.25 marks)
2.  Make HTTP requests with uv (1 mark)
3.  Run command with npx (0.5 marks)
4.  Use Google Sheets (0.25 marks)
5.  Use Excel (0.25 marks)
6.  Use DevTools (0.5 marks)
7.  Count Wednesdays (0.5 marks)
8.  Extract CSV from a ZIP (0.25 marks)
9.  Use JSON (0.75 marks)
10. Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON (0.5 marks)
11. CSS selectors (0.5 marks)
12. Process files with different encodings (1 mark)
13. Use GitHub (0.5 marks)
14. Replace across files (0.75 marks)
15. List files and attributes (0.75 marks)
16. Move and rename files (0.5 marks)
17. Compare files (0.5 marks)
18. SQL: Ticket Sales (0.75 marks)

**No specific code, commands, or error messages are visible in this screenshot.** The items listed under "Questions" are titles or descriptions of tasks, not executable code or command-line inputs.*

Hi Mandy,

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

Kind regards

*   **Save Advice:** `Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.` - General advice to the user about saving their work.

**3. Problem Description & Solution (SQL Query):**
*   **Problem Statement (Partially visible):** `Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units`
    *   This outlines the requirements for the SQL query:
        *   Filter records where the `type` column is "Gold".
        *   Handle leading/trailing spaces (implied by "Ignore spaces").
        *   Handle case-insensitivity (implied by "treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as 'Gold'").
        *   A subsequent instruction "Calculate the sales as Units" is cut off, suggesting there might be another part to the query or a follow-up question.
*   **Transcribed Code/Command:**
    ```sql
    FROM tickets
    WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';
    ```
    *   **Analysis of the Code:**
        *   `FROM tickets`: Specifies that the query is pulling data from a table named `tickets`.
        *   `WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`: This is the filtering condition.
            *   `TRIM(type)`: Removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the `type` column's values, addressing the "Ignore spaces" requirement.
            *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the result of `TRIM(type)` to lowercase, addressing the case-insensitivity requirement ("treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as 'Gold'").
            *   `= 'gold'`: Compares the cleaned and lowercased `type` value to the string 'gold'.

In summary, the screenshot shows a successful completion of a SQL problem on an online learning platform, demonstrating the correct use of `LOWER()` and `TRIM()` functions for robust string matching in a `WHERE` clause.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of an online learning platform, likely a Learning Management System (LMS), for a data science course. It provides information about a specific module and a graded assignment within that module.

**Key Information:**

*   **Institution:** IIT Madras
*   **Course/Term:** Jan 2025 - TDS (likely referring to a Data Science course for the January 2025 term).
*   **Navigation:** A left sidebar shows "Modules" (currently selected) and "Grades" as primary navigation options.
*   **Current View:** The user is viewing "Module 1: Development Tools". An upward-pointing chevron suggests this module section might be collapsible.
*   **Assignment Details:**
    *   **Assignment Name:** Graded Assignment 1
    *   **Assessment Due Date:** 26 Jan 2025
    *   **Submission Status:** The assignment has been "Submitted" (indicated in green text).
    *   **Student's Score:** "Your Score: 100" (a perfect score). There's a "View Chart" link associated with this score, presumably to see its distribution.
    *   **Peer Performance:**
        *   "Peer Average: 99%"
        *   "Median Score: 100"
        *   Both peer statistics also have "View Chart" links, indicating that students can compare their performance with the class's average and median. The high average and median scores suggest the assignment was either straightforward or the cohort performed exceptionally well.
*   **Top Right Icons:** Standard LMS icons for messages/chat, notifications, and user profile are visible.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code blocks, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The text is purely informational regarding the course structure and assignment performance.*

Thats not the dashboard.

We have checked your submissions. Unfortunately your last submission was 0 (on the 19th of Jan). Only the last submission is considered for evaluation not the previous ones.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *Based on the provided screenshot, here's an analysis of the key information:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot appears to be from an online learning platform, likely a student's dashboard or course progress page. It displays a course card and some associated details.

1.  **Course Information:**
    *   There is a prominently featured course titled "Tools in Data Science."
    *   Below the course title, it is explicitly labeled as a "NEW COURSE," indicating it might be a recently enrolled or started course.
    *   The course card has a dark blue background with a subtle dotted pattern and curved shapes.

2.  **Assignment Status:**
    *   Below the course card, there is an entry for "Week 1 Assignment" with a score of "0.00." This suggests that the first week's assignment has either not yet been submitted, has not been graded, or has received a score of zero.

3.  **Contextual Header (Partially Visible):**
    *   A partial header is visible above the course card, mentioning "Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA)." This strongly suggests that this page is related to the student's overall academic performance or a progress tracking section of the platform.

**Transcribed Text:**

*   **Header (partially visible):** "Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA)"
*   **Course Title:** "Tools in Data Science"
*   **Course Status:** "NEW COURSE"
*   **Assignment Entry:** "Week 1 Assignment - 0.00"*

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Why is there a mismatch between the scores?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "Recent saves" section, most likely from an online learning environment or a platform used for data science courses where students can submit or save their work (e.g., coding exercises, assignments, quizzes). It serves as a version history or attempt tracker for a specific piece of work.

### Key Information:

1.  **Purpose:** The section lists past saved states or attempts for a student's work, allowing them to review previous versions and their associated scores.
2.  **Versioning/Attempts:** Each entry represents a distinct save point or submission attempt, complete with a timestamp and a "Score." This suggests the system supports iterative work and tracks performance on each iteration.
3.  **Timestamps:** Each save is precisely time-stamped with the date (DD/MM/YYYY) and time (HH:MM:SS am/pm). The dates shown are in the future (2025), which is common for demo or placeholder data in educational platforms.
4.  **Scores:** A numerical score is associated with each save, indicating the result or evaluation of the work at that specific point in time. This is particularly relevant for graded assignments or automatically evaluated coding challenges.
    *   The highest score (8.5) is from the most recent save (27/1/2025), suggesting potential improvement over time.
    *   There are two saves on 22/1/2025, both with a score of 7.25, demonstrating multiple attempts or saves within a short timeframe.
5.  **Functionality:** The "Reload" button next to each entry implies that a user can revert to or load the state of their work corresponding to that particular save, which is useful for reviewing, debugging, or continuing from a specific point.
6.  **Absence of Error Messages/Code:** The screenshot does not contain any error messages or direct code snippets. It focuses solely on the save history metadata.

### Transcriptions:

**Text (Header):**
Recent saves

**Text and Commands/Buttons (Entries):**
Reload from 27/1/2025, 1:14:12 pm. Score: 8.5
Reload from 22/1/2025, 8:14:11 pm. Score: 7.25

Hi Yogesh,

There is no discrepancy, your last submission *before* the deadline was on 22nd Jan 8:14 pm. You scored 7.25, exactly as mentioned in your recent saves.

The higher score was on the 27th of Jan *after* the deadline.

Kind regards
