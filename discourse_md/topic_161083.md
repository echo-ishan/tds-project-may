> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science course assignment asking students to move and rename files. The task involves downloading "q-move-rename-files.zip", extracting it, and using "mv" to consolidate files into an empty folder. File renaming requires replacing each digit with the subsequent digit (e.g., a19b.txt becomes a20b.txt). The question is "What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?". This command sequence uses grep to match every character, sorts the output alphabetically, and calculates the SHA256 checksum of each file, likely intended to check for file corruption or duplicates after the renaming process.



  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

[@21f2000370](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f2000370) Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

The task asks the user to find all `<div>` elements with a class of "foo" within a hidden element, calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes, and input the result into the provided empty text field. A red exclamation mark indicates an error state for the input field. The key technical detail is the need to use CSS selectors to extract specific data from HTML elements based on their class and attributes.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?  
If [seek] ([Nptel Seekh](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002)) can access [TDS exam] ([Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)) then why we need to submit from seek?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

I answered questions on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.

Hi [@Nelson](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/nelson)

Your answers on the [exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/) site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).

It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute `data-value`. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute `data-value`.

I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question.  
It gives the error:

Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed.

The code uses `datetime` to define `start_date` and `end_date`, iterates to find the first Wednesday, and then counts Wednesdays by incrementing the date by 7 days until `end_date` is reached. The user input "1349" was incorrect, and the terminal output displays "Number of Wednesdays: 1349", suggesting that the program ran successfully but produced the wrong answer. The Python script `i.py` is executed, and the problem statement emphasizes the year-month-day date format.

The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.  



> **Image:** The Python code attempts to read three files (two CSVs and a TXT), detect their encodings using `chardet`, and sum values associated with specific symbols (€, #).  It handles potential `FileNotFoundError` and `UnicodeDecodeError` exceptions during file reading and `IndexError`, `ValueError` during value conversion. The code splits each line by a comma, extracts the symbol and value, and converts the value to float before adding it to `total_sum`.  The desired output, according to the tutorial video content, is the sum: 31512 which is displayed as the program output. The user successfully inputted paths for the files but the program reported the sum as 31512.0

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

Try copy pasting exact symbols `— OR † OR €` Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

Hi Jivraj,

I have tried with a different browser, but still not working. Below is the screenshot for your reference.  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a network connection error. The visible error message is "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED," indicating that the browser detected a change in the network connection. A blue "Refresh" button is provided as a UI element to attempt to reload the page. No code snippets or data visualizations are visible in this image. The primary issue is an interrupted network connection requiring the user to refresh the page.



Thanks

[@Samra](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/samra) this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate) firewall or antivirus. Please try with a personal laptop from a public / home network.

**This is regarding Question 11.**

I have extracted all the elements and added them manually. Tried all the options. Not even one appears to be correct . I evne tried ChatGPT which gave the answer as 411. Which of the following should be chosen?

```
<div class="d-none" title="This is the hidden element with the data-value attributes">
        <div class="bar baz" data-value="17">
          <div class="baz foo" data-value="29"></div>

        <div class="bar foo baz" data-value="71">

          <span class="foo" data-value="30"></span>
          <div class="foo bar" data-value="90">
            <div class="bar" data-value="8"></div>
            <div class="" data-value="48"></div>
          </div>
        </div>

Shouldn’t it be `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 --write README.md` or `npx prettier README.md` (Depending on whether to write or read)?

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,  
In one of the classes, you said that there is something - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??

Both `Get-FileHash` and `certutil` successfully compute the SHA256 hash of "formatted.md" as "216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175". The `prettier` command is used to format a file, redirecting the output to "formatted.md", potentially modifying the content of the file before hash verification.



In question 3 of GA-1 while checking the answer it’s showing incorrect answer.

216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?

The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a "Recent saves" section, likely from a data science platform. Three save points are listed with timestamps and scores: "19/1/2025, 8:17:25 pm. Score: 1.25", "19/1/2025, 8:01:54 pm. Score: 0.25", and "14/1/2025, 9:23:11 pm. Score: 0". Each save point has a corresponding "Reload" button, suggesting the user can revert to these saved states. The scores might represent the performance of a model at those specific save points. This information could be used to debug or compare model performance across different iterations.



Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.

Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.

If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.

Here are two disussions that might help you out.

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg. `output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt` and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

This implies the user may be comparing or re-evaluating past saved work within the course platform.

I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?

But since you *already* know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a *nearly* unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding the SQL Question I have attached my query. Please clarify me where I got wrong. I tried changing the gold string to lower and checking it. Even, that didn’t work.

The query is generating an error. The error message "Error: Got [[42810.5]]..." indicates that the system received the calculated sum, but the query or environment likely expects a different output format. The problem description instructs the user to calculate sales as "Units * Price" and sum the results for rows where "Type" is "Gold", including variations in capitalization or spacing.

Hi Arnav,

Problem might be you are not executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in correct directory, you would need to execute it from `all_files` directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested.

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name `Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

> **Image:** The user is attempting to obtain the JSON output of a `uv run` command that uses the `httpie` package to send an HTTPS request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with an email parameter. The expected output should be the JSON body. The user input, however, produces a `SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)`. The error suggests an issue with the format of the provided JSON. The JSON appears to be missing a surrounding square bracket in the 'args' object.



  
Not sure how to resolve this error… any sugessions ?

I tried this. For me still the answer is incorrect.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a PowerShell session where the user is calculating SHA256 hashes of files. First, the hash of `README.md` is computed using `certutil -hashfile C:\Users\sarva\downloads\README.md SHA256`, resulting in a specific hash value. Next, `README.md` is formatted using `prettier` and saved to `output.txt`. Finally, `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt` calculates the SHA256 hash of the `output.txt` file.  The output shows the Algorithm, the computed hash value, and the file path of the `output.txt` file in a tabular format.

Finally. Got the correct one in bit dash.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal session where the user is attempting to use `prettier` to format a `README.md` file and then pipe the output to `sha256sum`. The command used is `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`. The output displayed is a long alphanumeric string: `2ccd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *-`, which represents the SHA256 checksum of the potentially formatted README.md file content. The terminal prompt indicates the user is working in the `~/downloads` directory on a MINGW64 system. There are no error messages evident in the display.

I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer.

// Select all

and  elements with the ‘foo’ class  
const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”);

// Initialize a variable to store the sum  
let sum = 0;

// Iterate through the selected elements  
fooElements.forEach(element => {  
// Get the ‘data-value’ attribute and convert it to a number  
const value = parseFloat(element.getAttribute(“data-value”));

// Add the value to the sum  
if (!isNaN(value)) {  
sum += value;  
}  
});

console.log(“Sum of data-value attributes:”, sum);

## Q18 GA1

I don’t get what’s wrong with this:  



> **Image:** The user is trying to write an SQL query to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets from a "tickets" table. The table has columns named "type", "units", and "price".  The query uses `SELECT sum(units*price) FROM tickets WHERE type='gold' collate nocase;`, attempting to use `collate nocase` for case-insensitive matching. The error message "Error: Got [[124944.59]]..." suggests the query either failed to execute or returned an unexpected result. The prompt instructs the user to get all rows where the type is gold while ignoring capitalization.



Can anyone help me understand? Thanks

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

But I have completed it and got saved before the deadline

I havent answered the (yes / No ) in seek portal. If that might be a reason ?

Hello Sir,  
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of 100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “**absent**” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?
