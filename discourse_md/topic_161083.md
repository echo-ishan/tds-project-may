> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a task or question from a data science course, likely focusing on command-line file manipulation in a Unix/Linux environment.

Here's the key information:

**Task Details:**
*   **Task Number:** 16
*   **Title:** Move and rename files
*   **Points:** 0.5 marks

**Instructions and Objectives:**
1.  **Download and Extract:** Users are instructed to download and extract a specific ZIP file.
2.  **File Movement:** Use the `mv` command to move all files from any subdirectories into a single, empty target folder, effectively flattening the directory structure.
3.  **File Renaming:** Rename all files by incrementing each digit within the filename to the next consecutive digit.

**Final Question/Verification:**
After performing the file manipulations, the user needs to determine the output of a specific bash command pipeline run within the modified folder.

---

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages (exactly as they appear):**

*   **File to download:** `q-move-rename-files.zip`
*   **Command mentioned for moving files:** `mv`
*   **Renaming Example:** `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`
*   **Bash Command Pipeline:** `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`*



  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

> 

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a problem statement from a data science course, likely related to command-line proficiency and file system manipulation in Bash.

**Key Information:**

*   **Question Number and Weight:** Question 16, worth 0.5 marks.
*   **Problem Title:** "Move and rename files".
*   **Task 1: File Preparation:**
    *   Users are instructed to download a ZIP archive named `q-move-rename-files.zip`.
    *   They must then extract its contents.
*   **Task 2: File Movement:**
    *   Using the `mv` (move) command, all files currently located "under folders" (implying a nested directory structure) must be moved into a single "empty folder," effectively flattening the directory hierarchy.
*   **Task 3: File Renaming:**
    *   All files must be renamed. The rule for renaming is to replace "each digit with the next".
    *   An example is provided: `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`. This implies a digit increment (0->1, 1->2, ..., 9->0) that also handles carry-over if necessary, as shown by 19 becoming 20.
*   **Final Verification:**
    *   After completing the file movement and renaming tasks, the user is asked to run a specific Bash command pipeline on the modified folder.
    *   The goal is to determine and report what this command pipeline shows.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **File to download:** `q-move-rename-files.zip`
*   **Command for moving files:** `mv`
*   **Renaming example (original):** `a19b.txt`
*   **Renaming example (becomes):** `a20b.txt`
*   **Final Bash command pipeline:** `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`*



Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive exercise or problem statement from a data science course, likely focused on web scraping, front-end development, or data extraction using browser-based tools.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Exercise Objective:**
The user is being tested on their ability to select HTML elements using CSS selectors and perform a calculation based on attributes of those selected elements.

**2. Specific Task Requirements:**
*   **Selection Criterion 1:** Find all `div` HTML elements.
*   **Selection Criterion 2:** These `div` elements must specifically have a class named `foo`.
*   **Location:** The elements are located "in the hidden element below," which implies there's an HTML structure not visible in this screenshot but accessible within the full exercise environment (e.g., in a code editor, console, or a hidden iframe).
*   **Data Extraction:** For each identified `div` element, the user needs to retrieve the value of its `data-value` attribute.
*   **Final Calculation:** The ultimate goal is to find the *sum* of all these `data-value` attributes.

**3. Expected Output:**
The user is expected to provide a numerical sum, which should be entered into the designated input field.

**4. Current State/Error Indication:**
*   There's an empty input field labeled "Sum of data-value attributes:".
*   The input field is highlighted with a red border and contains a circular exclamation mark icon (ⓘ) on the right side. This strongly indicates an error state. It suggests either:
    *   The field is awaiting a correct input, and its current empty state is considered invalid.
    *   A previous attempt to submit an answer was incorrect, and the error state persists, possibly clearing the incorrect input.

**5. Missing Information (Crucial for Solving):**
The actual "hidden element" containing the HTML structure with the `div`s and their `foo` classes and `data-value` attributes is not visible in this screenshot. This HTML content is essential to solve the problem.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **HTML Tag:** `<div>` (used in the prompt as `div`s)
*   **CSS Class Name:** `foo`
*   **HTML Data Attribute:** `data-value`
*   **Error Message/Indicator:** (No explicit text, but the visual cue is) Red border around the input field and a circular exclamation mark icon (ⓘ).*



  
Which HTML content we want to take?

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a section of an online graded assignment or exam for a data science course, specifically "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development". The user is currently working on a question related to CSS selectors.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assignment Context & Status:**
*   **Course/Assignment Name:** "Graded Assignment 1 :: IITM" and "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development" (from the browser tabs).
*   **Due Date:** `Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST`
*   **Current Score:** `Score: 8.75 / 10`. This indicates the user has already attempted and scored highly on other parts of the assignment.
*   **Navigation/Actions:** `Check` and `Save` buttons are visible, suggesting it's an interactive assessment.
*   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1` - This URL indicates it's hosted on a `workers.dev` domain, likely a custom platform for the course.
*   **Next Question:** The bottom of the screen shows "12 Process files with different encodings (1 mark)", implying the current question is part of a larger multi-part assignment.

**2. Content Focus - CSS Selectors:**
*   The primary topic of this section is **CSS Selectors**, indicated by the prominent (though partially obscured) "SELECTORS!" heading.
*   **Educational Content:** The page provides a brief overview of CSS selectors, referencing the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) as a detailed resource.
    *   It lists three main types:
        *   `Basic CSS selectors`: for elements (like `div`), classes (`.container`), IDs (`#header`), and universal (`*`).
        *   `Attribute selectors`: to target elements based on attributes or values (e.g., `[type="text"]`).
        *   `Combinators`: to describe relationships between elements (e.g., `div > p`, `div + p`, `div ~ p`).
*   **Practice Tool Suggestion:** The assignment also recommends `CSS Diner` as an interactive game to practice CSS selectors.

**3. Current Problem/Question:**
*   **Prompt:** "Let's make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<div>`s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What's the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"
*   **User Input Field:** `Sum of data-value attributes:`
*   **User's Attempt:** The user has entered `482`.
*   **Error Message:** `Incorrect. Try again.` This indicates the submitted sum of `data-value` attributes from the specified `<div>` elements is wrong.
*   **Implied Task:** The user needs to utilize browser developer tools (e.g., Inspect Element) to locate "hidden elements" in the page's HTML, find all `<div>` tags with the class `foo` within those elements, extract the numerical values from their `data-value` attributes, and then sum these values.

**4. Browser Downloads (Overlay):**
*   A Chrome browser download pop-up is visible, showing a history of downloaded files. Most are marked as "Removed," but one `.csv` file is present.
    *   `q-unicode-data.zip` (Removed)
    *   `README (1).md` (Removed)
    *   `Book 2(Sheet1).csv`
    *   `q-unicode-data.zip` (Removed)
    *   `q-move-rename-files.zip` (Removed)
    *   While not directly related to the CSS question, the presence of a `.csv` file and file processing questions later (`Process files with different encodings`) hints at the broader data science context of the assignment.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **CSS Selector Examples:**
    *   `div`
    *   `.container`
    *   `#header`
    *   `*`
    *   `[type="text"]`
    *   `div > p`
    *   `div + p`
    *   `div ~ p`
*   **Question Specifics:**
    *   `<div>`
    *   `foo` (class name)
    *   `data-value` (attribute name)
*   **User Input:**
    *   `482`
*   **Error Message:**
    *   `Incorrect. Try again.`*

Hi, I’m unable to view assignments. below is the screenshot for your reference.  



> **Image Content:** *Based on the screenshot, here's the key information:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a common browser error page, indicating that a website cannot be reached. The page has a dark theme and features a "broken page" icon at the top. This type of error suggests a network connectivity issue preventing the user from accessing the intended resource.

Given the context of a data science course forum, this error likely indicates a student is unable to access an online exam, course materials, or perhaps a data science application or platform hosted at the specified URL. The `workers.dev` domain hints at a Cloudflare Workers deployment, which could be used for various course-related applications, APIs, or static site hosting. The specific error suggests that a connection was attempted but then unexpectedly terminated by the server or an intermediary.

**Transcribed Text (Code, Commands, and Error Messages):**

*   **Main Title:** This site can't be reached
*   **Specific Error Message:** exam.sanand.workers.dev unexpectedly closed the connection.
*   **Troubleshooting Suggestions (under "Try:"):**
    *   Checking the connection
    *   Checking the proxy and the firewall
    *   Running Windows Network Diagnostics
*   **Error Code:** ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?  
If [seek] ([Nptel Seekh](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002)) can access [TDS exam] ([Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)) then why we need to submit from seek?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to 

> **Image Content:** *Based on the provided screenshot, here is the expert analysis:

**Key Information:**

The image displays a user interface (UI) button.

*   **Object Type:** UI Button
*   **Appearance:** It is a rounded rectangular button with a solid blue background. The text "Save" is displayed centrally in white, with a slightly glowing or blurred effect, giving it a soft, illuminated appearance. This visual style is common in modern web or application interfaces, often indicating a primary action button or a button that is currently enabled/active.
*   **Function:** The button's label clearly indicates its purpose: to initiate a "save" action. In the context of a data science course forum, this button would likely be used to:
    *   Submit or save a draft of a new forum post or reply.
    *   Save edits made to an existing post or comment.
    *   Save user profile settings, preferences, or a personal bio.
    *   Potentially save progress on an integrated coding environment or notebook if the forum offers such functionality.
*   **Contextual Implication:** The presence of a "Save" button implies that there is user-generated content or configurable settings that can be persisted.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is no code, commands, or error messages present in this image.

*   **Text on Button:** `Save`*

 the submissions to get a score for the GA.

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score.

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

**For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.**

Hi [@Nelson](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/nelson)

Your answers on the [exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/) site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

*   **Problem Description:** The user is attempting to solve a problem in a data science course titled "Count Wednesdays (0.5 marks)". The task is to determine "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-09 to 2012-06-19?". Instructions specify that dates are in year-month-day format and both the start and end dates should be included in the count.
*   **User's Submitted Answer:** The user entered "1349" as their answer.
*   **Course Forum Feedback:** The forum system responded with "Incorrect. Try again." despite the user's answer.
*   **User's Solution:** The user has written a Python script to calculate the number of Wednesdays.
    *   It correctly defines `start_date` as `date(1986, 8, 9)` and `end_date` as `date(2012, 6, 19)`.
    *   It finds the first Wednesday on or after the `start_date`.
    *   It then iterates, adding 7 days (`timedelta(days=7)`) at a time, counting each Wednesday until `current_date` exceeds `end_date`.
*   **Python Script Output:** When executed, the Python script outputs "Number of Wednesdays: 1349".
*   **AI/Assistant Confirmation:** A separate section shows an AI or assistant confirming the count, stating, "There are 1349 Wednesdays in the date range from August 9, 1986, to June 19, 2012."
*   **Core Discrepancy:** The most critical piece of information is the direct contradiction:
    *   The user's Python code calculates **1349**.
    *   The terminal output confirms the code's calculation is **1349**.
    *   An AI/assistant explicitly states the correct answer is **1349**.
    *   However, the course forum marks the answer **1349** as "Incorrect. Try again."
    This suggests an issue with the course forum's grading system, its expected input format (e.g., leading/trailing spaces, or expecting additional text), or a potential bug in its answer validation, as the user's calculated answer appears to be correct based on their code and the AI's confirmation.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user's attempt to solve a data processing problem in a data science course, specifically focusing on character encoding and file handling. The user's Python code attempts to read, parse, and sum numerical values from three different files, each with a different encoding and delimiter. The problem appears to be from a module titled "Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You Part 2: Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM."

**Key Information:**

1.  **Problem Context:**
    *   The task involves downloading and processing files from `q-unicode-data.zip`.
    *   There are three files:
        *   `data1.csv`: CSV file encoded in CP-1252.
        *   `data2.csv`: CSV file encoded in UTF-8.
        *   `data3.txt`: Tab-separated file encoded in UTF-16.
    *   Each file has two columns: "symbol" and "value."
    *   The goal is to sum all values where the symbol matches a "specified symbols" list (the exact symbols are not visible in the screenshot but are critical for the solution).

2.  **User's Attempt and Error:**
    *   The user provided `31512` as their answer.
    *   The system responded with `Incorrect Try again.`
    *   The user's Python code also outputs `The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: 31512.0`, confirming this is the result their code produced.

3.  **Python Code Analysis (Potential Issues):**
    *   **Encoding Detection:** The code uses `chardet.detect()` to *automatically detect* the encoding of each file (`csv_data_1`, `csv_data_2`, `txt_data`). While `chardet` is useful, the problem statement *explicitly provides* the encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16). Relying on auto-detection can be unreliable, especially for UTF-16 without a Byte Order Mark (BOM), where `chardet` might misidentify it. It would be more robust to use the known encodings directly when opening the files.
    *   **Delimiter Mismatch:** The code assumes all files are comma-separated (`parts = line.strip().split(',')`). However, `data3.txt` is specified as *tab-separated*. This will cause `data3.txt` to be parsed incorrectly, leading to `IndexError` or incorrect data extraction, even if caught by the `try-except` block, it won't contribute correct values to the sum.
    *   **Symbol List:** The `if symbol in ['€', '£', '', '']:` line is incomplete or contains placeholder empty strings. The actual "specified symbols" from the problem description are crucial for correctly filtering and summing values, and their absence/incorrectness here is likely the primary reason for the incorrect sum.
    *   **Newline Handling:** Concatenating all file contents into `all_content = csv_data_1 + csv_data_2 + txt_data` and then splitting by `'\n'` (`lines = all_content.split('\n')`) might cause issues if files use different newline characters (e.g., `\r\n` vs. `\n`). This could lead to `\r` characters being present in the `value` strings, which might cause `float(value)` to fail or produce unexpected results if not handled by `strip()`.

**Exact Transcriptions:**

**1. Problem Description (Right Panel - Bottom)**

```
Download and process the files in q-unicode-data.zip, which contains three files with diffe

- data1.csv: CSV file encoded in CP-1252
- data2.csv: CSV file encoded in UTF-8
- data3.txt: tab-separated file encoded in UTF-16

Each file has 2 columns: symbol and value. Sum up all the values where the symbol match
What is the sum of all values associated with these symbols?

31512
Incorrect Try again.

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

kind regards

Try copy pasting exact symbols `— OR † OR €` Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum displays a PowerShell terminal session where the user `kaiff` is performing file hashing operations and file formatting. The core intent seems to be demonstrating or verifying file integrity, specifically using SHA256 hashes, and showing the effect (or lack thereof) of a code formatter.

Here's a breakdown of the key information, commands, and outputs:

**Key Information & Observations:**

1.  **Environment:** The user is operating in a PowerShell terminal (indicated by `PS C:\Users\kaiff>` and `powershell` in the top right corner).
2.  **File Formatting with Prettier:** A key operation demonstrated is the use of `npx prettier` to format a Markdown file.
    *   The source file is `F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md`.
    *   The formatted output is redirected to a local file named `formatted.md`.
3.  **File Hashing Tools:** Two different methods are used to calculate the SHA256 hash of `formatted.md`:
    *   `Get-FileHash`: A PowerShell cmdlet.
    *   `certutil -hashfile`: A Windows command-line utility.
4.  **Hash Consistency:**
    *   The SHA256 hash of `formatted.md` remains consistent across multiple `prettier` executions and calculations using both `Get-FileHash` and `certutil`. This implies that either the `README.md` file was already perfectly formatted according to Prettier's rules, or Prettier made no changes that affected the file's content (and thus its hash).
    *   The hash values output by `Get-FileHash` (uppercase hex) and `certutil` (lowercase hex) are identical after accounting for case, confirming both tools compute the hash correctly.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Output:**

```
PS C:\Users\kaiff> Get-FileHash -Path formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256

Algorithm       Hash                                                             Path
---------       ----                                                             ----

PS C:\Users\kaiff> npx -y prettier@3.4.2 "F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" > formatted.md
PS C:\Users\kaiff> certutil -hashfile formatted.md SHA256
SHA256 hash of formatted.md:

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?

The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).

[@23f2005067](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2005067) [@23f2003751](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2003751) I added a “Recent saves” feature.

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a section titled "Recent saves," which is likely part of an online learning platform or an integrated development environment within a data science course.

**Key Information:**

The section provides a historical log of a user's saved progress or submissions, allowing them to review or revert to previous states of their work. Each entry in the list contains the following information:

1.  **"Reload" Button:** A clickable button next to each entry, suggesting that users can load or revert to the specific saved state associated with that entry. This is highly useful for navigating different versions of a project, attempting multiple solutions, or recovering from errors.
2.  **Timestamp:** The exact date and time when the save occurred (e.g., "19/1/2025, 8:17:25 pm"). This chronological information helps users track their work history.
3.  **Score:** A numerical score associated with that particular save (e.g., "Score: 1.25"). This indicates the outcome or evaluation of the work at that save point. In a data science context, this score could represent the performance of a model, the correctness of code, or a grade from an automated assessment system.

The presence of varying scores (1.25, 0.25, 0) suggests iterative work and evaluation, which is common in data science projects where students might refine their code or models to achieve better results.

**Transcription:**

*   **Title:** Recent saves
*   **List Items:**
    *   Reload from 19/1/2025, 8:17:25 pm. Score: 1.25
    *   Reload from 19/1/2025, 8:01:54 pm. Score: 0.25
    *   Reload from 14/1/2025, 9:23:11 pm. Score: 0

No code, commands, or error messages are present in the image.*



Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.

Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg. `output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt` and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) sir,

Question 15 is under the section for linux

I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a formatted table, typical of command-line output, showing details about several files. It appears to be a listing of files and their metadata, likely generated by a system command (e.g., `ls -l` on Unix-like systems or `dir` on Windows, but with simplified column headers) or a custom script in a data science environment.

**Key Information:**

*   **File Metadata:** The table provides four pieces of information for each file:
    *   **Length:** The size of the file, presumably in bytes.
    *   **Date:** The last modification or creation date of the file, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    *   **Time:** The last modification or creation time of the file, in HH:MM format.
    *   **Name:** The name of the file.
*   **Files Listed:** There are four files, named sequentially from `file0.txt` to `file3.txt`. All appear to be plain text files.
*   **Chronological Order (by Date):** The files are not sorted chronologically by date; for instance, `file2.txt` (2000-01-26) is older than `file0.txt` (2004-03-10).
*   **Context:** In a data science course forum, this output would likely be presented as a demonstration of file system interaction, data file organization, or as part of an exercise involving reading file metadata before processing the file contents.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

The screenshot shows the output of a command, not the command itself or an error message. The entire content of the screenshot is transcribed below as it appears:

```
Length      Date        Time    Name
----------  ----------  ------  ----
4094        2004-03-10  07:49   file0.txt
8410        2007-02-11  18:46   file1.txt

9748        2010-09-27  00:34   file3.txt
```*



I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?

[@23f2000573](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000573) You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas.

But since you *already* know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a PowerShell console session demonstrating common command-line operations, file manipulation, and error handling. It appears to be part of an exercise or debugging process in a data science or development course, likely focusing on command-line utilities and file integrity.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** The session is running in PowerShell on a Windows system, indicated by `PS C:\Users\HP>` prompts.
2.  **Directory Navigation Error:**
    *   The user successfully changed directories from `C:\Users\HP` to `C:\Users\HP\downloads` using `cd downloads`.
    *   An attempt was made to change directory again to `Downloads` (with a capital 'D') from within `C:\Users\HP\downloads`. This failed with a `PathNotFound` error, indicating that a directory named `Downloads` (case-sensitive or not present) does not exist directly within `C:\Users\HP\downloads`. This highlights a common user error related to path specification or case sensitivity.
3.  **File Formatting with Prettier:**
    *   The `npx` command was used to execute `prettier` (a code formatter) version `3.4.2`.
    *   It processed a file named `README.md`.
    *   The formatted output was redirected (`>`) to a new file named `output.txt` in the current directory (`C:\Users\HP\downloads`). This is a common practice for formatting code or documentation.
4.  **File Hashing for Integrity:**
    *   The `Get-FileHash` PowerShell cmdlet was used to calculate the hash of the newly created `output.txt` file.
    *   The algorithm used for hashing is SHA256.
    *   The hash value and the path to the file are displayed, likely for verification purposes (e.g., checking if the output matches an expected result).

[@Rohitkumar7463](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/rohitkumar7463) The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a *nearly* unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

**Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question**

quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.  
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the JSON output from a web service (likely `httpbin.org`), which reflects the details of an incoming HTTP GET request. This type of information is commonly used in data science or web development courses to teach students about network communication, web APIs, and how web browsers send information to servers.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Request Parameters (`args`):**
    *   The `args` object contains query parameters that were passed in the URL. Here, a single parameter named `email` is present with the value `241001769@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email format (`@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) strongly suggests the user is a student from an Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) Data Science program, which aligns with the "data science course forum" context.

2.  **Request Headers (`headers`):**
    *   This section details the various HTTP headers sent by the client's browser. These headers provide crucial information about the client's capabilities, preferences, and identity.
    *   **`Accept`**: Indicates the content types the client can process (HTML, XML, various image formats, signed-exchanges).
    *   **`Accept-Encoding`**: Specifies the compression methods supported (gzip, deflate, br, zstd).
    *   **`Accept-Language`**: Shows the user's preferred languages (English US, English India).
    *   **`Dnt`**: "Do Not Track" header, set to `1`, indicating the user's preference not to be tracked.
    *   **`Host`**: The domain to which the request was sent, which is `httpbin.org`.
    *   **Client Hints (`Sec-Ch-Ua`, `Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile`, `Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform`):** These headers provide detailed, privacy-preserving information about the user-agent. They indicate the browser is **Microsoft Edge (version 132)**, built on **Chromium (version 132)**, running on a **Windows** operating system, and is **not a mobile device**.
    *   **Fetch Metadata Headers (`Sec-Fetch-Dest`, `Sec-Fetch-Mode`, `Sec-Fetch-Site`, `Sec-Fetch-User`):** These enhance security and privacy by providing context about the request's origin and destination. They suggest a standard user-initiated navigation to a document.
    *   **`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`**: Set to `1`, indicating the client prefers secure (HTTPS) connections.
    *   **`User-Agent`**: A comprehensive string identifying the client software: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/132.0.0.0`. This confirms Windows 10 (64-bit) and Microsoft Edge (version 132), which is Chromium-based.
    *   **`X-Amzn-Trace-Id`**: An AWS X-Ray trace ID (`Root=1-67903bee-5b25fdd838b5abb00263808c`), indicating that the request might have passed through AWS infrastructure or a service instrumented with AWS X-Ray.

3.  **Origin IP Address (`origin`):**
    *   The IP address `45.118.156.154` is the public IP address from which the HTTP request originated.

4.  **Requested URL (`url`):**
    *   The full URL that was requested: `https://httpbin.org/get?email=241001769%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This confirms the `email` parameter was passed as a query string. The `%40` is the URL-encoded representation of the "@" symbol.

**In the context of a data science course forum:**
This screenshot likely serves as an example for students to understand:
*   How parameters are sent via URLs.
*   The various pieces of information a browser sends as HTTP headers.
*   How a server (like `httpbin.org`) reflects these details.
*   Debugging web requests when interacting with APIs (a common task in data science for data retrieval).

> **Image Content:** *Here's a breakdown of the key information from the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays a task or question from a data science course, specifically "Move and rename files" (worth 0.5 marks). The task requires the user to perform a series of file system operations using Bash commands, and then provide the SHA256 sum of the output of a specific command pipeline as the answer.

The steps outlined are:
1.  **Download and Extraction:** Download `q-move-rename-files.zip` and extract its contents.
2.  **File Movement:** Use the `mv` command to move all files from subfolders into a single empty folder.
3.  **File Renaming:** Rename all these files. The renaming rule is to replace each digit in the filename with the next consecutive digit (e.g., 1 becomes 2). A special rule applies to '9', which becomes '0'. An example `a1b9c.txt` becoming `a2b0c.txt` is provided to illustrate this.
4.  **Verification/Submission:** After performing the above steps, the user is instructed to run a specific Bash command pipeline (`grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`) in the folder containing the modified files. The resulting output (a SHA256 hash) is the required answer.

The screenshot shows that the user has attempted to answer the question by submitting a SHA256 hash, but the system has marked it as "Incorrect."

**Transcriptions:**

*   **Task Title:**
    `16 Move and rename files (0.5 marks)`

*   **Instructions:**
    `Download q-move-rename-files.zip and extract it. Use mv to move all files under folders into an empty folder. Then rename all files replacing each digit with the next. 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, a1b9c.txt becomes a2b0c.txt.`

*   **Command to Execute/Verify Output:**
    `What does running grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum in bash on that folder show?`

*   **User's Submitted Answer (Hash):**
    `f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d *`

*   **Error Message/Feedback:**
    `Incorrect. Try again.`*



  
Sir I’m facing issue in this question even though i have done every thing as it mentioned. Can I get hint of the mistake for my code snippet.  
My code: -

```
mkdir all_files
find parent/ -type f -exec mv {} all_files/ \;
for file in all_files/*; do
    new_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/[0-9]/\n&\n/g' | awk '
    { 
        if ($0 ~ /^[0-9]$/) print ($0 == "9") ? 0 : $0+1; 
        else print $0 
    }' | tr -d "\n")
    mv "$file" "$new_name"
done

```

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding the SQL Question I have attached my query. Please clarify me where I got wrong. I tried changing the gold string to lower and checking it. Even, that didn’t work.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Problem Statement:** The user is tasked with calculating the total sales for items belonging to the "Gold" ticket type. Sales are defined as `Units * Price`. The solution requires writing an SQL query.

2.  **User's SQL Query Attempt:**
    The user has written the following SQL query in the code editor:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(Units*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE == 'Gold';
    ```

3.  **Observed Error Message:**
    Below the code editor, a red error message is displayed:
    ```
    Error: Got [[42810.5]]...
    ```
    This likely indicates that the system expected the query to return the value `42810.5`, but the user's query either failed to execute or produced a different (incorrect) result. The truncation `...` suggests the full error message might be longer, or it's part of a comparison/diff output. The presence of the red border and exclamation mark icon on the code block further confirms an error state.

4.  **Additional Instructions/Clarifications:**
    Below the error, there are further instructions guiding the user on how to correctly approach the problem:
    ```
    Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.
    ```

**Analysis and Identified Issues:**

*   **Primary Issue (SQL Syntax Error):** The most immediate problem with the user's query is the use of `==` for equality comparison in the `WHERE` clause (`WHERE TYPE == 'Gold'`). In standard SQL, the equality operator is a single equals sign (`=`). This syntax error would prevent the query from executing correctly in most SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite).

*   **Secondary Issue (Logical Robustness - Case and Space Handling):** The additional instructions highlight a crucial logical requirement: the comparison for "Gold" should be case-insensitive and ignore leading/trailing spaces, treating variations like "GOLD" or "gold" as "Gold". The current `WHERE TYPE = 'Gold'` (even if the `==` is corrected) is a case-sensitive, exact match. To meet this requirement, the user would need to employ string functions like `LOWER()` (or `UPPER()`) and `TRIM()` on the `TYPE` column, for example: `WHERE LOWER(TRIM(TYPE)) = 'gold'`.

*   **Error Message Interpretation:** The `Error: Got [[42810.5]]...` suggests that `42810.5` is the correct total sales value for "Gold" tickets. The error likely implies a comparison failure, where the query either returned nothing (due to the syntax error) or a value other than `42810.5`.*



  
Thank You.

I have another doubt regarding the CSS Selector question. I know how to select elements using CSS Selector but i don’t know how to get the sum using CSS Selectors as it cannot perform arithmetic operations. And also, I didn’t understand the question completely about the ‘hidden element’. Please clarify it. Thank you so much.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an interactive exercise from a data science course, likely focusing on web data extraction or parsing (e.g., using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or `lxml` with CSS selectors).

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** The user is challenged to practice selecting HTML elements using CSS selectors.
2.  **Task Details:**
    *   **Target Elements:** Find all `<div>` elements.
    *   **Condition:** These `<div>` elements must have a class named `foo`.
    *   **Context:** The elements are located within a "hidden element" (presumably an HTML snippet not visible in this screenshot but accessible to the user in the learning environment).
    *   **Calculation:** The user needs to calculate the sum of the `data-value` attributes for all identified `<div>` elements.
3.  **Input Requirement:** The calculated sum is expected to be entered into a designated input field.
4.  **Current Status:** The user has previously submitted an answer that was marked as incorrect. The input field is currently empty, but the error message indicates a failed attempt.

**Transcribed Text/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **Prompt:** "Let's make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all <div>s having a foo class in the hidden element below. What's the sum of their data-value attributes?"
*   **Input Field Label:** "Sum of data-value attributes:"
*   **Error Message:** "Incorrect. Try again."*

sir i have gone through the process of solving the ques but still ans is showing wrong even i have used chatgpt and used cmd also. the cmd is is showing the result still ans is wrong  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a common problem faced by students in data science courses involving file system operations and metadata. The user is attempting to calculate the total size of files based on specific criteria, and their submitted answer is incorrect despite their command producing that value.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Terminal/Command Prompt Content:

The black command prompt window shows a series of commands executed from the directory `C:\Users\lakshika\Downloads\q-list-files-attributes`.

1.  **Directory Listing Example:**
    This section shows a `dir` command's output, indicating the presence of various `.txt` files with sizes and a date of `24-01-2025 09:57`. This future date is highly suspicious and hints at a timestamp issue, which is later confirmed by the forum's hint.
    ```
    24-01-2025 09:57        5950 file84.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        7732 file85.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        9867 file86.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57       10213 file87.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        2870 file88.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        6786 file89.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        9749 file9.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        1070 file90.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        3308 file91.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        3452 file92.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        5286 file93.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        2852 file94.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        9044 file95.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        8630 file96.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        4636 file97.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        7559 file98.txt
    24-01-2025 09:57        2698 file99.txt
                   100 File(s)      513187 bytes
                     2 Dir(s)  74610814976 bytes free
    ```

2.  **`for /f` command (attempt to filter `dir` output):**
    This command appears to be an initial, more complex attempt to filter directory listings using `cmd.exe` features like `for /f` and `findstr`. It's not directly related to the final correct solution but shows the user exploring options.
    ```
    C:\Users\lakshika\Downloads\q-list-files-attributes>for /f "tokens=5*" %A in ('dir /T:W /C ^| findstr /R "^[ ][1-9][0-9][3,]"') do @echo %A %B
    ```

3.  **PowerShell Command (First Execution - Calculation):**
    This is the core command used to attempt to answer the question. It uses PowerShell to get file information, filter it, and then sum the sizes.
    ```powershell
    C:\Users\lakshika\Downloads\q-list-files-attributes>powershell -Command "& { Get-ChildItem . -Path . -File | Where-Object { $_.Length -ge 1235 -and $_.LastWriteTime -ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00' } | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum }"
    ```
    *   `Get-ChildItem . -Path . -File`: Lists all files in the current directory.
    *   `Where-Object { $_.Length -ge 1235 -and $_.LastWriteTime -ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00' }`: Filters files where:
        *   The file `Length` (size) is greater than or equal to `1235` bytes.
        *   The `LastWriteTime` is on or after November 6, 2019, 10:48:00 (note the `MM/DD/YYYY` format used in the command).
    *   `Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum`: Calculates statistics, specifically the sum of the `Length` property for the filtered files.

    **Output of this command:**
    ```
    Count    : 91
    Average  :
    Sum      : 507182
    Maximum  :
    Minimum  :
    Property : Length
    ```
    The `Sum` property shows `507182`, which the user then entered as the answer.

4.  **PowerShell Command (Second Execution - Output to File):**
    This command is almost identical to the previous one, but instead of summing, it pipes the filtered list of files to a text file named `result.txt`. This is likely an attempt by the user to debug or inspect which files are being selected by their filter.
    ```powershell
    C:\Users\lakshika\Downloads\q-list-files-attributes>powershell -Command "& { Get-ChildItem . -Path . -File | Where-Object { $_.Length -ge 1235 -and $_.LastWriteTime -ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00' } | Out-File -FilePath result.txt }"
    ```

### Forum Post Content:

The lower part of the screenshot shows the problem description and user interaction on a course forum.

1.  **Question Title:** `15 List files and attributes (0.75 marks)`

2.  **Instructions:**
    *   `Download q-list-files-attributes.zip and extract it.`
    *   `Use ls with options to list all files in the folder along with their date and file size.` (The user correctly interpreted "ls" as PowerShell's `Get-ChildItem` for Windows).

3.  **Specific Question:**
    `What's the total size of all files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 am IST?`

4.  **User's Answer & Feedback:**
    *   User's submitted answer: `507182`
    *   Feedback: `Incorrect. Try again.` (with a warning icon)

5.  **Crucial Hint:**
    `Don't copy from inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the timestamps. Extract using unzip, 7-Zip or similar utilities and check the timestamps.`

### Analysis and Key Information:

*   **Objective:** The user needs to find the sum of file sizes based on two criteria: minimum size (1235 bytes) and a specific last write time (`Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 am IST`).
*   **User's Approach:** The user correctly identified the need for PowerShell and `Get-ChildItem` with `Where-Object` and `Measure-Object`.
*   **The Discrepancy:**
    *   The `Sum` value `507182` was produced by the PowerShell command.
    *   This sum was then submitted as the answer.
    *   The answer was marked `Incorrect`.
*   **Root Cause (Identified by Hint):** The most likely reason for the incorrect answer lies in the **timestamp preservation during ZIP extraction**.
    *   The initial `dir` output showing dates from "24-01-2025" (a future date) strongly suggests that the files' `LastWriteTime` attributes were altered upon extraction, possibly defaulting to the current system date or a standard `dir` listing behavior for files that lose their original timestamp.
    *   The hint explicitly states: *"Don't copy from inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the timestamps."* This is a critical piece of information.
    *   If the original timestamps were not preserved, the `$_.LastWriteTime -ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00'` condition in the `Where-Object` clause would be evaluating against the *incorrect, recently modified timestamps* instead of the original timestamps from 2019 that are relevant to the problem. This would cause a different set of files (or no files if all timestamps are recent) to pass the filter, leading to an incorrect sum.
*   **Date Format Consideration:** The question specifies `Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 am IST` (`DD Mon YYYY`), while the user's PowerShell command uses `'11/06/2019 10:48:00'` (`MM/DD/YYYY`). While these might resolve to the same date depending on locale settings, the primary issue is almost certainly the corrupted timestamps due to improper extraction rather than a date format misinterpretation by PowerShell itself for that specific date.

**In summary, the user's calculation method is correct, but the input data (specifically the files' last write timestamps) has been corrupted by the extraction process, leading to the wrong result.** The solution is to re-extract the `q-list-files-attributes.zip` using a tool like 7-Zip or `unzip` (as suggested by the hint) that explicitly preserves file metadata like last modified dates, and then re-run the PowerShell command.*

Hi Arnav,

I tried your script on your dataset.  
Problem might be you are not executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in correct directory, you would need to execute it from `all_files` directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, including transcriptions:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a user's attempt to solve a file system analysis problem in a data science course forum. The user is tasked with finding the total size of files based on specific criteria.

1.  **Problem Statement:**
    *   **Task:** "List files and attributes (0.75 marks)"
    *   **Instructions:** "Download `q-list-files-attributes.zip` and extract it. Use `ls` with options to list all files in the folder along with their date and file size."
    *   **Specific Question:** "What's the total size of all files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 AM IST?"

2.  **User's Attempt & Environment:**
    *   The user is operating in a Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`) within the directory `C:\Users\lakshika\Downloads\q-list-files-attributes`.
    *   They first seem to have run a `dir` command (or part of one, `for /F ...`) which shows 100 files, totaling 513187 bytes, with dates like `24-01-2025`.
    *   The primary command used to answer the question is a PowerShell command executed via `cmd.exe`. This command filters files based on `Length` and `LastWriteTime` and then sums their lengths.

3.  **User's Calculated Answer:**
    *   The PowerShell command produced a `Sum` of `507182`.
    *   The user entered `507182` as their answer in the forum.

4.  **System Feedback:**
    *   **Result:** `Incorrect. Try again.`
    *   **Crucial Hint/Error Message:** "Don't copy from inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the timestamps. Extract using unzip, 7-Zip or similar utilities and check the timestamps."

**Analysis of the Problem:**

The PowerShell command appears to correctly implement the filtering logic for file size (`-ge 1235`) and last write time (`-ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00'`). The discrepancy in the answer is directly attributed by the forum's hint to the method of extracting the ZIP file. If timestamps are not preserved during extraction (common when using simple "copy-paste" from inside a ZIP or certain default Windows Explorer behaviors), the `LastWriteTime` property of the extracted files will reflect the extraction date, not the original modification date. This leads to an incorrect set of files being included (or excluded) in the sum, despite the command's logic being sound. The user needs to re-extract the ZIP file using a tool that preserves timestamps (like `unzip` or `7-Zip`) and then re-run their PowerShell command.

**Transcriptions:**

**Terminal Commands and Output:**

```
C:\Users\lakshika\Downloads\q-list-files-attributes>for /F "tokens=5*" %A in ('dir /T:W /C-I ^| findstr /R "^[ ][ ][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] [0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9] [ ][1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] [0-9]{3,}"') do @echo %A %B

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name `Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

kind regards

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a web-based tool or interface titled "JSON Hash," likely part of a data science course or development environment. The user is attempting to hash a string, but the input is not correctly formatted as JSON.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Tool/Page Title:** "JSON Hash"
    *   This indicates the purpose of the interface: to generate a hash from JSON input.

2.  **Input Area (Text Box):**
    *   The user has entered a long string of characters that *resembles* key-value pairs, separated by colons (`:`) and commas (`,`). For example, `TQTalKz: pClV9WY, z: DMG, zySeiW: iQGGFKMX, C: iXYVlUASer, ...`
    *   **Observation:** The string is missing crucial JSON syntax:
        *   It is not enclosed within curly braces `{}` (for a JSON object) or square brackets `[]` (for a JSON array).
        *   Neither the keys (e.g., `TQTalKz`, `z`, `zySeiW`) nor the values (e.g., `pClV9WY`, `DMG`, `iQGGFKMX`) are enclosed in double quotes (`"`), which is a requirement for string types in JSON.
        *   Many of the characters/words are underlined with red squiggles, indicating that a spell checker is active and does not recognize them as standard dictionary words, but this is separate from the JSON parsing error.

3.  **Action Button:**
    *   A green button labeled "Hash" is present, indicating the action the user intends to perform on the input text.

4.  **Error Message:**
    *   A prominent red banner at the bottom displays an error message.
    *   **Transcription:**
        ```
        Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)
        ```
    *   **Analysis of the Error:**
        *   "Expected property name or '}' in JSON": This is the core issue. A JSON parser expects an object to start with `{` and then either a quoted property name (a key) or a closing `}` if the object is empty. The input `TQTalKz: ...` starts directly with an unquoted string `TQTalKz`.
        *   "at position 1 (line 1 column 2)": This precisely points to the location of the error. The parser found an unexpected character (`T`) at the very beginning of the input where it expected to start parsing a valid JSON structure (likely anticipating `{` at column 1, and then a quoted key or `}` at column 2).

In summary, the user is attempting to process malformed JSON. The tool correctly identifies that the input string does not conform to JSON syntax, specifically by lacking the required enclosing curly braces and double quotes around keys and string values, leading to the error message.*



  
In the question 10 what should be the correct format for jason data as I edited the data according to given conditions but in Hash I am facing problem again and again

Also, in Q11 What is meaning of element below given in the question " Let’s make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<div>` s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What’s the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science or command-line course forum, presenting a practical assignment involving file manipulation and hashing in a Unix/Linux environment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Task Instructions:**
    *   **File Download:** Users are instructed to download a zip file: `q-replace-across-files.zip`.
    *   **Unzipping:** Unzip the downloaded file into a new folder.
    *   **Text Replacement:** The core task is to perform a text replacement within *all* files in that folder. Specifically, replace "IITM" (case-insensitive, i.e., "in upper, lower, or mixed case") with "IIT Madras".
    *   **Constraint:** A crucial instruction is to maintain file integrity by ensuring "don't change the line endings." This implies that the replacement method used should not inadvertently alter newline characters, which would affect file hashes.

2.  **Verification Question:**
    *   After completing the text replacement, the user needs to provide the output of a specific bash command: "What does running `cat * | sha256sum` in that folder show in bash?"
    *   This command concatenates the content of all files (`cat *`) in the current directory and then pipes (`|`) that combined content to `sha256sum`, which computes a SHA256 cryptographic hash of the entire concatenated stream. This hash is the expected answer for verification.

3.  **User's Submission and Error:**
    *   **Submitted Command Output/Hash:** The user has entered a SHA256 hash in the input field.
        ```
        63144b28ad1d2bd5b9b4b0855cab6a4a4fa8d57ed2ed826b4f5b36d12ae97347
        ```
    *   **Error Message:** The system returned an error, indicating the submitted answer is incorrect.
        ```
        Incorrect. Try again.
        ```

**In summary:** The user performed the required file operations and generated a SHA256 hash of the modified files' contents but submitted an incorrect hash, suggesting an error in their execution of the text replacement (e.g., case sensitivity issue, failure to replace in all files, or altering line endings) or in running the verification command.*



The answer is wrong but I have done every step correctly. Help

*January 25, 2025, 18:32 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely related to a programming assignment or lab. It involves using a package manager (`uv`) to interact with a web service (`httpbin.org`) and process JSON output.

**Key Information:**

*   **Topic:** Python package/project management using `uv`, HTTP requests, and JSON parsing.
*   **Command Line Tool:** The `uv` command is introduced as a tool to install Python packages (specifically `httpie`) and execute commands that send HTTP requests.
*   **Task Description:**
    *   The user is instructed to run a command using `uv` to install `httpie`.
    *   Then, they need to send an HTTPS GET request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with a specific URL-encoded `email` parameter (`23f200098@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`).
    *   The final requirement is to extract and paste *only the JSON body* of the command's output, excluding headers.
*   **User's Attempt:** The user has provided an answer that appears to be a dictionary-like structure representing JSON output, containing `args` (with the email), `origin` (IP address), and `url`.
*   **Problem/Error:** The system has rejected the user's input with a `SyntaxError`, indicating that the provided text is not valid JSON. This is likely because JSON requires double quotes for string keys and values, whereas the user has used single quotes (which is valid in Python dictionaries but not in strict JSON).

**Transcriptions:**

**1. Instruction about `uv` command:**
`Running uv run --with httpie -- https [URL] installs the Python package httpie and sends a HTTPS request to the URL.`

**2. Specific request to be sent:**
`Send a HTTPS request to https://httpbin.org/get with the URL encoded parameter email set to 23f200098@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`

**3. Question for the user:**
`What is the JSON output of the command? (Paste only the JSON body, not the headers)`

**4. User's input (within the red-bordered box):**
`{'args':{'email':'23f200098@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'},'origin':'106.197.103.245','url':'https://httpbin.org/get?email=23f200098%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in'}`

**5. Error Message:**
`SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)`*

I tried this. For me still the answer is incorrect.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum shows a PowerShell terminal session demonstrating file hashing and manipulation techniques.

### Key Information:

The user `sarva` is working in the `C:\Users\sarva` directory, then changes to `C:\Users\sarva\downloads`. The core activity involves:
1.  **Calculating the SHA256 hash of an original file (`README.md`) using `certutil`.**
2.  **Processing the `README.md` file using `npx prettier` and redirecting its output to a new file (`output.txt`).** This step implies that `prettier` might alter the content (e.g., formatting) of the original `README.md` before writing it to `output.txt`.
3.  **Calculating the SHA256 hash of the newly created file (`output.txt`) using `Get-FileHash`.**

The significant observation is the **difference between the SHA256 hash of the original `README.md` and the `output.txt` file**. This difference (eef23... vs CECFD...) confirms that the `prettier` command, when applied to `README.md` and output to `output.txt`, resulted in a file with different content (or at least different byte sequence) than the original, even if the semantic content remains similar. This is a common concept in data integrity and version control.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

### Post #109 by **Saravanan** (ds-students)
*January 25, 2025, 22:33 UTC*
Finally. Got the correct one in bit dash.



> **Image Content:** *As an expert at analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a detailed breakdown of the key information presented in the image:

This screenshot displays a terminal session, likely from a developer or data scientist's environment, performing a common integrity or formatting check.

### Key Information:

1.  **User and System Context:**
    *   **User:** `sarva`
    *   **Hostname:** `SURIYA`
    *   **Shell/Environment:** `MINGW64`. This indicates the user is likely on a Windows operating system but using a Unix-like shell environment, such as Git Bash, which leverages MinGW-w64 to provide common Linux commands.
    *   **Current Directory:** `~/downloads`. The user is operating from their home directory's `downloads` subdirectory.

2.  **Command Executed:**
    The user executed a single command:
    ```bash
    npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum
    ```

    *   **`npx`**: This is a Node.js package runner, part of npm (Node Package Manager). It allows running Node.js packages without explicitly installing them globally or locally, often for one-off commands or specific version checks.
    *   **`-y`**: This flag automatically answers "yes" to any prompts, making the command non-interactive (e.g., confirming installation of the `prettier` package if it's not cached).
    *   **`prettier@3.4.2`**: This specifies the `prettier` package (an opinionated code formatter) and, importantly, a *specific version*, `3.4.2`.
    *   **`README.md`**: This is the input file to `prettier`. Prettier will read this file and output its formatted version.
    *   **`|` (Pipe Operator)**: This redirects the standard output (stdout) of the command on the left (`npx ... README.md`) to be the standard input (stdin) of the command on the right (`sha256sum`).
    *   **`sha256sum`**: This utility computes and verifies SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) checksums. When used with a pipe, it calculates the hash of the data it receives via stdin.

3.  **Command Purpose (Interpretation):**
    The user is effectively calculating the SHA256 hash of the *formatted content* of the `README.md` file, as it would be formatted by `prettier` version `3.4.2`. They are *not* modifying the `README.md` file directly in this command (as `prettier` typically requires a `--write` flag for in-place formatting). This setup is common for:
    *   **Verifying Code Style/Consistency:** In CI/CD pipelines, this can be used to ensure that a `README.md` (or any code file) adheres to a specific formatting standard by comparing its formatted hash against a known good hash.
    *   **Debugging Formatting Differences:** Checking how a file *would* be formatted by a specific `prettier` version without committing changes.
    *   **Data Integrity Check:** If the `README.md` is dynamically generated (e.g., from a Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file), this could be a way to check its integrity or consistency.

4.  **Output:**
    The command produced a single line of output:
    ```
    2ccdd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *-
    ```

    *   **`2ccdd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1`**: This is the 64-character hexadecimal SHA256 hash of the formatted `README.md` content.
    *   **`*-`**: This trailing part from `sha256sum` indicates that the checksum was calculated from standard input (stdin), confirming that it processed the piped output from `prettier`.

In the context of a data science course forum, this screenshot might be part of a discussion on:
*   Setting up development environments (Node.js, Git Bash).
*   Using command-line tools for code formatting and quality control.
*   Understanding shell piping and data flow.
*   Implementing basic CI/CD concepts or automated checks for project documentation.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an interactive problem from a data science course, likely focusing on command-line file manipulation and data extraction.

Here's the key information:

**1. Task Description:**
*   **File Download:** The user is instructed to download a ZIP file named `q-list-files-attributes.zip`.
*   **File Extraction:** After downloading, the file needs to be extracted.
*   **Initial File Listing:** The user is asked to use the `ls` command with appropriate options to list all files in the extracted folder, including their date and file size. (Common `ls` options for this include `ls -l` or `ls -lh`).

**2. Problem Question:**
*   The core task is to calculate the **total size** (in bytes) of files that meet two specific criteria:
    *   They must be at least `2404` bytes large.
    *   They must have been modified on or after `Mon, 18 Mar, 2002, 1:02 am IST`.

**3. User Input and Error:**
*   **Submitted Answer:** `485969`
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Incorrect. Try again.
    ```

**4. Troubleshooting Hint:**
*   The error message is followed by crucial advice regarding file extraction and timestamps:
    *   **Common Pitfall:** Do not copy files from inside the ZIP archive or use Windows Explorer to unzip, as this "destroys the timestamps."
    *   **Recommended Utilities:** Users should extract using `unzip`, `7-Zip`, or similar utilities.
    *   **Verification:** It's explicitly stated to "check the timestamps" after extraction to ensure they are preserved correctly.

**Summary of Commands/Code/Error Messages:**

*   **File Name:** `q-list-files-attributes.zip`
*   **Command Hint:** `ls`
*   **Recommended Utilities for Extraction:** `unzip`, `7-Zip`

### Post #115 by **Bhargav Chavda** (ds-students)
*January 26, 2025, 15:24 UTC*
## Q18 GA1

I don’t get what’s wrong with this:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a common scenario in an online data science learning environment, likely an interactive SQL exercise. The user is attempting to write a SQL query to solve a specific problem, and the system is providing feedback, including an error message.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Key Information:

1.  **Problem Context:**
    *   The user is working with a SQLite database.
    *   There is a table named `tickets`.
    *   Each row in `tickets` represents a customer bid for a concert ticket.

2.  **Table Schema and Sample Data:**
    *   The `tickets` table has three columns:
        *   `type`: Describes the ticket type (e.g., 'Silver', 'gold', 'BRONZE'). Note the mixed casing.
        *   `units`: The number of units bid (integer values like 589, 559, 74, 361, 673).
        *   `price`: The price per unit (floating-point values like 1, 1.18, 1.03, 1.76, 1.94).
    *   The table snippet indicates there are more rows (`...`).

3.  **Problem Statement/Objective:**
    *   "What is the total sales of all the items in the 'Gold' ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it."
    *   This requires:
        *   Filtering rows where `type` is 'Gold' (case-insensitively).
        *   Calculating sales for each filtered row as `units * price`.
        *   Summing up these individual sales (`SUM()`).

4.  **User's Attempted SQL Query:**
    *   The user has written a SQL query that attempts to fulfill the requirements.

5.  **Error Message and Visual Cues:**
    *   The query box is outlined in red, indicating an error.
    *   There's a small "information" icon (ⓘ) in the top-right of the query box, often used for warnings or detailed error information.
    *   The text `collate` is underlined in blue, and `nocase;` has a wavy red underline, strongly suggesting a syntax error specifically with the `COLLATE NOCASE` clause or its placement/termination in this environment.
    *   The error message itself is quite unusual: `Error: Got [[124944.59]]...` This suggests that the query *might have executed and produced the correct numerical result* (124944.59), but the system still marked it as an "Error". This could be due to:
        *   The platform expecting a different output format (e.g., just the number, without `COLLATE NOCASE` being interpreted as part of the output string).
        *   Strict syntax validation where `COLLATE NOCASE` is not expected directly after the string literal in the `WHERE` clause, or the semicolon is misplaced for the specific platform's parser.
        *   A subtle interaction between the SQL dialect (SQLite in this case) and the platform's query runner.

6.  **Hint/Clarification:**
    *   "Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold"." This explicitly confirms the need for case-insensitive matching for the 'Gold' type and clarifies that "mis-spellings" in this context refers to case variations.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a task from a data science course forum, likely testing command-line proficiency and understanding of specific development tools.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Objective:** The user is being tested on their ability to use `npx` (Node Package Executor) and `prettier` (a code formatter).
2.  **Task Steps:**
    *   **Download:** The user must first download a file named `README.md`. It's implied this file contains some content that needs formatting.
    *   **Naming Convention:** Ensure the downloaded file is indeed named `README.md` and is in the current working directory.
    *   **Execute Command:** Run a specific shell command that combines formatting with hashing.
3.  **Command Pipeline Explanation:**
    *   `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md`: This part uses `npx` to execute version `3.4.2` of the `prettier` tool on the `README.md` file. The `-y` flag likely means "yes" to any prompts, allowing for non-interactive execution. `prettier` outputs the formatted content to standard output.
    *   `|`: This is a pipe operator, which takes the standard output of the `prettier` command and sends it as standard input to the `sha256sum` command.
    *   `sha256sum`: This command calculates the SHA256 cryptographic hash of its input (which is the *formatted* content of `README.md`).
4.  **Question:** The user is asked to provide "What is the output of the command?". This specifically refers to the SHA256 hash generated by the pipeline.
5.  **Expected Output/Validation:** A red-bordered input field shows the exact SHA256 hash that is expected, presumably as the correct answer or a verification of a submitted answer. The information icon typically indicates a hint or a validation message.

---

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

**Command to execute:**
`npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`

**Expected Output (SHA256 Hash):**
`AC06784D6825497650083DDFD6746A2CDD561B6A1FF45241C6A354035244A75C`

### Key Information:

1.  **Question Context:** This is question number 10, titled "Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON," worth 0.5 marks, indicating it's a practical, skills-based assessment item within a larger course or exam.
2.  **Task Description:** The student is instructed to:
    *   Download a text file named `q-multi-cursor-json.txt`.
    *   Use "multi-cursors" (a common text editor feature) to transform the content of this file.
    *   Convert `key=value` pairs found in the file into a single JSON object with the format `{key: value, key: value, ...}`. This implies proper JSON syntax (e.g., keys and string values enclosed in double quotes, colons separating key-value, commas between pairs).
    *   Paste the resulting JSON into a specific online tool: `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash`.
    *   Click the "Hash button" on that tool.
    *   Submit the generated hash as the answer.
3.  **Student's Attempt:** The student has submitted a hexadecimal string, presumably the hash generated from their JSON.
4.  **Result/Feedback:** The submitted answer is incorrect.

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

After passing the deadline , my scores aren’t there …Is it same for all?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the instructions for an assignment or quiz on an online learning platform, likely for a Data Science course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Course/Assignment Identification & Deadline:**
*   **Course/Assignment Title:** "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development To" (The word "To" is cut off at the end, implying "Tools" or "Topics").
    *   This indicates it's an assignment (GA1, likely Graded Assignment 1) for a course named "TDS" (The Data Science, or similar abbreviation), for the January 2025 term.
*   **Deadline/Completion Status:** "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
    *   This indicates the assignment has concluded, or this is its set end date and time in Indian Standard Time.

**2. Instructions for the Assignment:**
A numbered list provides clear guidelines for participants:

1.  **Learn what you need.** Reading material is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the question. (Or learn it, just for pleasure)
    *   *Interpretation:* Emphasizes practical knowledge over rote memorization of provided material.
2.  **Check answers regularly by pressing Check.** It shows which answers are right or wrong. You can check multiple times.
    *   *Interpretation:* Promotes iterative learning and self-correction during the assignment.
    *   **Command/Button:** `Check`
3.  **Save regularly by pressing Save.** You can save multiple times. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.
    *   *Interpretation:* Crucial for progress tracking; only the final state is graded.
    *   **Command/Button:** `Save`
4.  **Reloading is OK.** Your answers are saved in your browser (not server). Questions won't change except for randomized parameters.
    *   *Interpretation:* Answers are stored client-side (local storage); allows for browser restarts without losing progress, but be aware of possible parameter changes for questions.
5.  **Browser may struggle.** If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.
    *   *Interpretation:* Acknowledges potential technical compatibility issues and suggests troubleshooting steps.
6.  **Use anything.** You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.
    *   *Interpretation:* Highly open-ended and collaborative environment, encouraging real-world problem-solving skills rather than isolated testing.
7.  **It's hackable.** It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.
    *   *Interpretation:* This is a *highly significant* and unconventional instruction. It implies the assignment might involve web development, debugging, or reverse-engineering concepts, encouraging students to inspect the underlying code to find solutions. This is a very progressive and practical approach to learning in a data science or software development context.

**3. Advice for Course Success (Should you take TDS this term?):**

*   If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS.
    *   *Interpretation:* Provides a time benchmark for self-assessment of readiness or proficiency for the overall course.
*   If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck.
    *   *Interpretation:* Outlines grading expectations for high performance, acknowledging that factors beyond just the score (effort, and even "luck") can influence top grades.

**In summary:** This screenshot describes an assignment that is highly flexible, encourages the use of all available resources (including AI and collaboration), and uniquely allows "hacking the code" for solutions, suggesting a practical, hands-on, and perhaps unconventional learning philosophy for the "TDS" course.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a section of a user interface from an online learning platform or an interactive environment, likely associated with a data science course.

Here's the key information observed:

1.  **User Authentication:**
    *   The prominent text "You are logged in as **22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**" indicates the specific user account currently logged into the system. The domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` strongly suggests this is a student account from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) Data Science program.
    *   A "Logout" button is present, allowing the user to end their session.

2.  **Recent Saves Section:**
    *   Below the login information, there is a section titled "Recent saves" (within a light green box). This feature allows users to review and potentially reload previous states of their work or progress.
    *   Each entry in this section provides:
        *   A "Reload" button: This button allows the user to load the specific saved state into the active session.
        *   A timestamp: Indicating when the save was made.
        *   A "Score": Associated with that particular save.

3.  **Specific Save Details:**
    *   Three recent saves are displayed, all from the same date: **1/23/2025**.
    *   The timestamps for these saves are very close together, indicating rapid consecutive saves:
        *   Save 1: `9:33:02 PM`
        *   Save 2: `9:32:59 PM`
        *   Save 3: `9:32:55 PM`
    *   Notably, all three saves show the exact same "Score: **8**". This suggests that the user might have been working on a problem or assignment where they achieved a score of 8, and then made multiple saves of that state within a few seconds.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code blocks, command-line inputs, or error messages visible in this screenshot. The text is primarily descriptive and navigational (button labels).

*   **User Login:** `22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Button Labels:**
    *   `Logout`
    *   `Reload` (appears three times)
*   **Informational Text:**
    *   `You are logged in as`
    *   `Recent saves`

Dear Sai,

This is NOT the picture of your dashboard.

22f3001740:

> 

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a student's progress and status for an assignment within an online data science course platform, likely hosted by IIT Madras.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Course Module & Assignment Details:**
*   **Module:** "Module 1: Development Tools"
*   **Assignment Name:** "Graded Assignment 1" (This is a clickable link, suggesting it leads to the assignment details or submission portal.)
*   **Assessment Due Date:** "26 Jan 2025"
*   **Submission Status:** "Not Submitted" (highlighted in red, indicating the student has not yet submitted the final assignment.)

**2. Performance Metrics for "Graded Assignment 1":**
*   **Your Score:** `-` (Indicates no score yet, consistent with "Not Submitted".)
*   **Peer Average:** `99%` (This is exceptionally high, suggesting the assignment is either relatively easy for the cohort or the students are performing very well.)
*   **Median Score:** `100` (Even higher than the average, reinforcing the observation of high peer performance on this assignment.)

**3. User Information:**
*   **Logged In User:** The user is logged in as `22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email address clearly identifies the student and points to an academic domain, likely associated with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) and its data science (ds.study) program.
*   **Logout Button:** A standard `Logout` button is present for session management.

**4. Recent Saves / Progress Tracking:**
*   **Section Title:** "Recent saves" (This suggests a feature where the user's progress on the assignment is periodically saved.)
*   **Saved Entries:** There are three distinct save entries, all from the same date but slightly different times:
    *   `Reload` from `1/23/2025, 9:33:02 PM. Score: 8`
    *   `Reload` from `1/23/2025, 9:32:59 PM. Score: 8`
    *   `Reload` from `1/23/2025, 9:32:55 PM. Score: 8`
*   **Observations from Saves:**
    *   All saves occurred on January 23, 2025, within a very short span of 7 seconds (9:32:55 PM to 9:33:02 PM).
    *   Each saved state has a "Score: 8". This indicates an *intermediate* or *partial* score, possibly from an auto-graded section of the assignment or a check of current progress before final submission. This `Score: 8` is distinct from the final "Your Score" which is currently `-`.
    *   The `Reload` button next to each save suggests the ability to revert the assignment to a previously saved state.

**Summary:**
The screenshot shows a student's dashboard for "Graded Assignment 1" in "Module 1: Development Tools" of a data science course. The assignment is due on January 26, 2025, and has not yet been submitted. While the student's final score is pending, their peers have achieved extremely high scores (99% average, 100 median).

Hello Sir,  
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of 100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “**absent**” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online examination or assignment platform for a data science course, likely hosted by an institution like IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras).

Here's the key information:

**1. Platform and User Context:**
*   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1`
    *   This indicates the platform is `exam.sanand.workers.dev` and the specific assessment is identified as `tds-2025-01-ga1`. The `.workers.dev` domain suggests it might be hosted on Cloudflare Workers.
*   **Logged-in User:** The user is logged in as `23f3001601@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This appears to be a student ID or username associated with a data science study program at IITM.
*   **Logout Option:** A "Logout" button is present.

**2. Exam Status and Deadline:**
*   **Status:** The assessment has concluded. This is prominently displayed in a red bar: "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".
*   **Deadline:** The official deadline for the exam was Sunday, January 26, 2025, at 11:59 PM Indian Standard Time (IST).

**3. Scoring Information:**
*   **Displayed Score (Top):** "Score: 0" is shown next to the "Ended at..." message. This might be a placeholder, the score of the current view, or an unsubmitted state.
*   **Official Score (Recent Saves):** The "Recent saves" section clarifies the actual official score. The header states: "(most recent is your official score)".
    *   The most recent save, timestamped "1/27/2025, 12:00:05 AM", shows a "Score: 8".
    *   This indicates that despite the "Score: 0" at the top, the student's final evaluated score for the assessment is **8**.
*   **Save History:** The platform records previous saves:
    *   `1/27/2025, 12:00:05 AM. Score: 8` (This save occurred 5 seconds *after* the stated deadline, indicating either a grace period, an automatic final save, or the time of processing the submission).
    *   `1/26/2025, 11:59:55 PM. Score: 8` (This save occurred 5 seconds *before* the deadline).
    *   `1/26/2025, 11:59:55 PM. Score: 8` (Another save at the same time).
*   **Functionality:** "Reload" buttons are available next to each save, presumably to view or revert to that specific saved state of the exam.

**4. Support and Navigation:**
*   **Discussion Forum:** A blue banner encourages interaction: "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse". "Discourse" is a popular forum software.
*   **Action Buttons:** "Check all" and "Save" buttons are present, though their functionality might be limited or for review-only since the exam has ended.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
*   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1`
*   **Timestamp/Text (Red Bar):** `Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST Score: 0`
*   **Button Text (Red Bar):** `Check all` `Save`
*   **Text (Blue Banner):** `Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse`
*   **Login Information:** `You are logged in as 23f3001601@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`
*   **Button Text (Login):** `Logout`
*   **Header (Recent saves):** `Recent saves (most recent is your official score)`
*   **Save Entry 1:** `Reload from 1/27/2025, 12:00:05 AM. Score: 8`
*   **Save Entry 2:** `Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:59:55 PM. Score: 8`
*   **Save Entry 3:** `Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:59:55 PM. Score: 8`*



  



> **Image Content:** *Based on the screenshot, here's the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course Identification:** The image displays a banner for a data science course, clearly titled "Tools in Data Science."
2.  **Course Status:** The course is explicitly labeled as a "NEW COURSE," indicating it might be recently launched or updated.
3.  **Assignment Status:** Below the course banner, there's an entry for "Week 1 Assignment" with a status of "Absent." This suggests that the first week's assignment for a student is either missing, not submitted, or was marked as not completed. This implies a view from a gradebook, assignment list, or course progress tracker within a learning management system (LMS) or forum.

**Transcription:**

*   **Course Title (partially visible):** Tools in Data Science
*   **Course Label:** NEW COURSE
*   **Assignment Entry:** Week 1 Assignment - Absent*

I’ve created a PR for the same on GitHub! Please have a look and let me know what you think Prof!
