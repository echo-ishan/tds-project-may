Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a GitHub repository named "tds_project-1." The repository's main branch contains files such as "app.py", "requirements.txt", "Dockerfile", and a "venv" directory, with associated commit messages like "Final Submission" and "First submission".  There are LICENSE related commits: "Create LICENSE" and "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE." The UI shows options to "Go to file," "Add file," and access the "Code." The repository has "6 Commits" and is currently at commit "c61a6ef".



  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays the results of prerequisite checks for Project 1 in a data science course. The system checks for the presence of a Docker image in Docker Hub, a public GitHub repo, a "Dockerfile" in the repo's root, and an MIT license. While the Docker image, GitHub repo, and Dockerfile pass the checks, the MIT license is missing from the root of the GitHub repository, leading to an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status and a "Project 1 Score: 0". The failure to meet prerequisites prevents evaluation.



Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Hi [@22f3000585](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3000585)

Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

[Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)

Kind regards

> **Image:** The submission from the specified GitHub repository "https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git" resulted in a failure. The error messages indicate three potential problems: "No such repo," meaning the repository might not exist or is inaccessible. Secondly, the system couldn't find "MIT" in the LICENSE file, potentially indicating a missing or incorrectly specified license. Finally, the system couldn't find a Dockerfile in the repository, which might be required.



  
Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.  



> **Image:** The screenshot indicates a submission checklist failure in a data science course.  The submission is failing because "No 'MIT' in LICENSE" and "No Dockerfile" are reported. This suggests the submission lacks an MIT license statement in the LICENSE file and is missing a Dockerfile.  Submissions must pass the checklist to be considered for scoring. Only the latest submission from students is being considered.

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.

Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.

These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.

Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.

We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.

I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.

Kindest regards

Sir,  
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).  
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.  
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.  
Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

Sir, I received the mail today -  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a pre-requisite check for a data science project, showing pass/fail status for several requirements.  The check "Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License)" returns a failure (0). A Docker repo and a Github repo both exist and are public with timestamps before February 18th (pass = 1).  A Dockerfile exists in the GitHub repository (pass = 1).



  
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.  



> **Image:** The screenshot indicates a failing submission with the Github repository "https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git".  The submission failed due to three reasons: "No such repo", "No "MIT" in LICENSE" and "No Dockerfile". This suggests the repository either doesn't exist, is private, or doesn't contain the required files/content ("LICENSE" containing "MIT" and "Dockerfile"). The UI presents these error messages as the primary cause of the failing submission. No data visualizations or charts are present in the screenshot.



  
Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.  



> **Image:** This screenshot shows a GitHub repository's file listing, likely related to a data science project.  Files like `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, and `test.txt` are present, indicating a deployable application with testing.  The presence of "venv" suggests a virtual environment is used.  Commits are tracked, with the latest being "Create LICENSE" 5 days ago, and a rename from "LICENSE" to "MIT LICENSE" 2 months ago. The repo has a total of 6 commits.



  
Sir can you please check.  
Thankyou
