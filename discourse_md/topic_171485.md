Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.

### Analysis of GitHub Repository: `tds_project-1`

This image displays the file structure and recent commit history of a public GitHub repository. It gives us insights into the project's setup, its current state, and recent activities.

---

**1. Repository Overview:**

*   **Repository Name:** `tds_project-1`
*   **Visibility:** `Public`
*   **Current Branch:** `main` (The repository currently has only `1 Branch` and `0 Tags`).
*   **Total Commits:** `6 Commits`

**2. Latest Overall Commit Information:**

*   **Commit Hash:** `c61a6ef`
*   **Commit Message:** `Create LICENSE`
*   **Commit Timestamp:** `now` (This indicates it's the very latest action on the repository).

**3. File and Folder Structure (with Last Commit Message and Time):**

The repository contains several common files and directories seen in Python-based data science or software projects:

*   **Folder:** `__pycache__`
    *   Last Commit Message: `Final Submission`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* This folder contains Python bytecode cache files. It's typically ignored in version control (`.gitignore`) as it's generated artifacts. Its presence suggests local development has occurred.

*   **Folder:** `venv`
    *   Last Commit Message: `First submission`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* This is a Python virtual environment. Its inclusion in the repository is generally discouraged as it can lead to large repositories and environment inconsistencies across different systems. Best practice is usually to exclude it via `.gitignore` and rely on `requirements.txt` for environment recreation.

*   **File:** `Dockerfile`
    *   Last Commit Message: `First submission`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* The presence of a `Dockerfile` indicates that the project is containerized, likely using Docker. This is excellent for creating reproducible environments and for deployment purposes, common in MLOps and production data science applications.

*   **File:** `LICENSE`
    *   Last Commit Message: `Create LICENSE`
    *   Last Updated: `now`
    *   *Note:* This is the project's current license file. Its "now" timestamp and corresponding latest overall commit message indicate it was just created or significantly updated.

*   **File:** `MIT LICENSE`
    *   Last Commit Message: `Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* This file suggests a previous licensing state. The commit message "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE" implies that at some point, the `LICENSE` file was renamed to `MIT LICENSE`. The fact that a *new* `LICENSE` file has just been created (`now`) might mean the project is changing its license again, or consolidating, or the `MIT LICENSE` file is now a legacy artifact. This could be a point of confusion for users without further context from the commit history.

*   **File:** `app.py`
    *   Last Commit Message: `Final Submission`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* This is very likely the main Python application script for the project, possibly containing the core data science logic, model serving, or web application code.

*   **File:** `requirements.txt`
    *   Last Commit Message: `First submission`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* This file lists all the Python package dependencies required for the project. It's crucial for environment reproducibility, allowing anyone to recreate the exact software environment the project was developed in using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

*   **File:** `test.txt`
    *   Last Commit Message: `First submission`
    *   Last Updated: `2 months ago`
    *   *Note:* A generic text file, possibly used for simple tests, temporary notes, or placeholder content.

**Key Takeaways for a Data Science Project:**

1.  **Python-centric:** The project is clearly built with Python, indicated by `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `venv`.
2.  **Reproducibility Focus:** The presence of `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` highlights an effort towards creating reproducible environments, which is a best practice in data science for both development and deployment.
3.  **Project Stages:** The commit messages like "First submission" and "Final Submission" suggest a structured project lifecycle, potentially aligning with course milestones.
4.  **Licensing Updates:** The recent creation of a new `LICENSE` file, along with the older `MIT LICENSE` file, indicates recent attention to or changes in the project's licensing terms. It might be worth reviewing the full commit history to understand the exact licensing evolution.
5.  **Virtual Environment:** The `venv` folder is present, indicating the use of isolated Python environments, which is good practice. However, it's typically excluded from version control to prevent repository bloat.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation report for "Project 1" within a data science course, specifically focusing on prerequisite checks. The report indicates whether a student's submission meets the foundational requirements for the project to be fully evaluated.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Overall Policy:** A prominent statement at the top warns that failure to meet minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.
2.  **Project Context:** The evaluations are for "Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations."
3.  **Individual Prerequisite Checks:** Four specific items are checked, each with a "PASS" or "FAIL" status.
    *   **Docker Image Presence & Publicity:** The student successfully has a Docker image present and public on Docker Hub.
    *   **GitHub Repository Presence & Publicity:** The student successfully has a GitHub repository present and public.
    *   **Dockerfile Presence:** A `Dockerfile` is correctly present in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    *   **MIT License Presence:** This is the **critical failure point**. An "MIT license" file is explicitly stated as *not* being present at the root of the GitHub repository.
4.  **Overall Prerequisite Status:** Due to the single failure point, the "Prerequisites" are marked as "FAIL."
5.  **Project Score:** As a direct consequence of failing the prerequisites, the "Project 1 Score" is **0**. This confirms the initial warning that the submission was not further evaluated.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (exactly as they appear):**

```
If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated.

These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL

Prerequisites: FAIL
Project 1 Score: 0
```*



Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Hi [@22f3000585](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3000585)

Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays an automated or instructor feedback message regarding a student's submission for a data science course project. The submission, which appears to be a GitHub repository, has failed due to several specific missing components or issues.

*   **Submission Status:** The submission has a result of **FAIL**.
*   **Submission Identifier:** The submission is linked to a GitHub repository: `https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git`.
*   **Reasons for Failure:** There are three distinct reasons provided for the failure, indicating that the submission did not meet certain requirements:
    1.  The specified GitHub repository could not be found or accessed ("No such repo").
    2.  The `LICENSE` file in the repository (if present) does not contain the string "MIT", suggesting a requirement for an MIT license.
    3.  A `Dockerfile` is missing from the repository, which is typically required for containerizing the project's environment.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

The following text appears in the screenshot, with the highlighted portions indicating specific issues:

"We see that your submission https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:
No such repo;No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile"*



  
Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.  



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the breakdown:

### Key Information

The screenshot displays important instructions and policies regarding student submissions for a course assignment or project.

1.  **Submission Checklist/Requirements:** There are two explicit negative requirements for submissions:
    *   The `LICENSE` file must *not* contain the string "MIT". This likely means the submission should not use the MIT license, or perhaps that any reference to it must be removed.
    *   The submission must *not* include a `Dockerfile`. This indicates that containerization setup files are either not required, or are explicitly disallowed.
2.  **Scoring Eligibility:** Submissions will only be considered for scoring if they successfully pass the above-mentioned checklist. Failure to meet these conditions will result in the submission not being scored.
3.  **Submission Policy for Multiple Submissions:** If a student submits their work more than once, only the *latest* submission will be considered for evaluation and scoring. This policy is in place because students were permitted to submit multiple times.

### Transcription

Here is the exact transcription of the text as it appears in the image:

```
No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile

Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring.

Note: We've only considered your latest submissions, as we permitted students to submit more than once.
```*

[@24ds2000125](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24ds2000125) [@22f3000585](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3000585)

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.

Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.

These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.

Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.

We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.

I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.

Kindest regards

Sir,  
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).  
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.  
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.  
Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

**Reactions:** ❤️ 1

*April 06, 2025, 13:59 UTC*
Sir, I received the mail today -  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the results of a "Pre-requisites check" for a data science course or project. It outlines several requirements related to repository setup on Docker and GitHub, indicating whether each prerequisite has passed (1) or failed (0).

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The text provides a clear status update on several project prerequisites.
*   **Check Categories:** The checks involve both Docker and GitHub repositories.
*   **Specific Requirements Checked:**
    *   Existence and public status of a Docker repository, with a timestamp requirement (before Feb 18th).
    *   Existence and public status of a GitHub repository, with a timestamp requirement (before Feb 18th).
    *   Existence of a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file (specifically an MIT License) within the GitHub repository.
    *   Existence of a `Dockerfile` within the GitHub repository.
*   **Results:**
    *   The Docker repo check passed.
    *   The GitHub repo check for existence and public status passed.
    *   The GitHub repo check for a `LICENSE` file **failed**. This is the only failed check.
    *   The GitHub repo check for a `Dockerfile` passed.
*   **Context (Inferred):** This is likely a status output from an automated grading script or a manual review process for an assignment, where students need to set up their repositories correctly. The failing license check indicates an issue that the student needs to address.

**Transcription:**

Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 0
Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1*



  
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays automated feedback regarding a project submission in a data science course. The core information conveyed is that a student's submission has **failed**, and it lists three specific reasons for this failure. The submission was made via a GitHub repository.

1.  **Submission Status:** The submission has a result of **FAIL**.
2.  **Submission Identifier:** The submission linked to a specific GitHub repository URL.
3.  **Reasons for Failure:** Three distinct issues are cited as the cause of the failure, indicating missing or incorrectly configured elements within the submitted repository.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
We see that your submission https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:
No such repo No "MIT" in LICENSE No Dockerfile
```*



  
Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a file and commit history view of a Git repository, commonly seen in platforms like GitHub or GitLab, which is typical for managing projects in a data science course.

**Key Information:**

*   **Repository Name/ID:** `22f3000585`
*   **Latest Commit Details:**
    *   **Commit Message:** `Create LICENSE`
    *   **Commit Hash (short):** `c61a6ef`
    *   **Commit Age:** `5 days ago`
    *   **Total Commits in Repository:** `6 Commits`

*   **File/Directory Listing with Last Commit Information:**

| Type   | Name              | Last Commit Message               | Last Modified Age |
| :----- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| Folder | `_pycache_`       | `Final Submission`                | `2 months ago`    |
| Folder | `venv`            | `First submission`                | `2 months ago`    |
| File   | `Dockerfile`      | `First submission`                | `2 months ago`    |
| File   | `LICENSE`         | `Create LICENSE`                  | `5 days ago`      |
| File   | `MIT LICENSE`     | `Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE`   | `2 months ago`    |
| File   | `app.py`          | `Final Submission`                | `2 months ago`    |
| File   | `requirements.txt`| `First submission`                | `2 months ago`    |
| File   | `test.txt`        | `First submission`                | `2 months ago`    |

**Analysis:**

The repository contains files typical of a Python-based data science or web application project, including:
*   Python source code (`app.py`).
*   Dependency management (`requirements.txt`).
*   Containerization (`Dockerfile`).
*   Development environment artifacts (`_pycache_`, `venv`).
*   Licensing information (`LICENSE`, `MIT LICENSE`).
*   A placeholder or test file (`test.txt`).

Most of the project's files (Docker, main app, dependencies, virtual environment, and cache) were last touched "2 months ago," with commit messages indicating "First submission" or "Final Submission."

The most recent activity, occurring "5 days ago," was the creation of a new `LICENSE` file. This is interesting given that an `MIT LICENSE` file was present and was explicitly renamed from `LICENSE` "2 months ago." This could indicate:
1.  A change in licensing strategy, where the project reverted to a general `LICENSE` file or added a second license.
2.  An oversight where a new `LICENSE` file was added without removing the previously renamed `MIT LICENSE`.
3.  A specific course requirement to include a `LICENSE` file, perhaps a generic one, which was added later.

The presence of `_pycache_` and `venv` directories in the repository history, particularly `venv` which is often large and frequently excluded by `.gitignore` in Git projects, might be unusual for a clean repository but could be part of specific submission requirements for a course.*



  
Sir can you please check.  
Thankyou
