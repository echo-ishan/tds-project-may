hello sir this is Harish. i completed and saved the week 2 and week 4 assignment. (didn’t do week 3) but the graded assignment shows it is incomplete and the score is 0 for both the weeks . i am attaching the iages. kindly check and reply soon sir.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays content from a data science course forum, specifically the "Graded Assignment 2" page. A message indicates that "The due date for submitting this assignment has passed. Due on 2025-02-02, 23:59 IST.".  Troubleshooting tips are provided, suggesting users disable ad blockers, allow cookies, ensure JavaScript is enabled, use Chrome, and disable browser extensions. The page also emphasizes the use of a specific student ID format and includes a link to the assignment: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2". The UI element of interest is the selected "Graded Assignment 2" in the course navigation menu.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a data science course interface. The user "23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" is logged in and the assignment "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".  The "Recent saves" section displays timestamps (e.g., "2/2/2025, 6:14:56 pm") associated with corresponding scores of 6.5. The UI includes buttons like "Reload", "Check all", and "Save", suggesting potential actions on saved work. The overall score is displayed as 0.



this is for week 4  



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a "Graded Assignment 4" in a data science course module on "Data Sourcing".  A warning icon and the text "Graded Assignment 4" are visible in the module list. The primary issue is that "The due date for submitting this assignment has passed. Due on 2025-02-09, 23:59 IST." The interface suggests checking for common problems like ad blockers, cookie restrictions, JavaScript issues, browser extensions, antivirus interference, or corporate network restrictions, if access to the linked assignment is difficult. The assignment link is provided: `https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4`.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a forum page for a data science course, specifically related to "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse" within IITM BS. The deadline is indicated as "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST", and the user's current "Score: 0" is displayed alongside "Check all" and "Save" buttons.  The user is logged in as "23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." The "Recent saves" section shows timestamps and scores of previous attempts, with a "Reload" button for each one.





> **Image:** The screenshot shows a "Tools in Data Science" online course interface, labeled as a "NEW COURSE." The user has completed "Week 1 Assignment" and received a score of 87.50.  A button labeled "Go to Course page >" is present, likely for navigation. No code snippets, error messages, or data visualizations are visible in this specific image. The problem the user faces could be accessing course materials.



kindly check on this sir.

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir in my case, in week 2 it is showing “Absent” but I have attempted and saved the answers  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a student's progress in the "Tools in Data Science" course. The student has a "REPEAT FULL COURSE" option, indicating they may be retaking the course. The assignments are listed with their scores: "Week 1 Assignment - 57.50", "Week 2 Assignment - Absent", and "Week 3 Assignment - 58.00". The student has missed "Week 2 Assignment." A "Go to Course page >" link is visible for further navigation.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays recent saves with associated scores within a data science course platform. It shows the logged-in user's email address ("22f2000559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") and a "Logout" button. The "Recent saves" section shows a list of save timestamps (e.g., "2/3/2025, 12:00:10 AM") along with corresponding scores (e.g., "Score: 7"). Each save entry has a "Reload" button, presumably to revert to that saved state. The text "most recent is your official score" indicates the importance of the latest entry.

Hi [@22f2000559](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f2000559)

I can confirm that our server did record your marks as 7, we will make a correction in the dashboard. Thanks for letting us know. My sincere apologies for the error.

If the marks on the dashboard are not changed within the next 7 days, please let us know. I will follow it up on my end and try to get the correction pushed as soon as possible.

Sir, I have attempted the graded assignment 2 and also saved it but my score is showing as absent. Please look into the issue sir.  
My email id is 23f1002071@ds.study.iitm.ac.in



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science course interface.  The displayed score is "Score: 0", but there are "Recent saves" showing earlier attempts with scores of "5.5" and "2".  There are "Reload" options for each save. The UI includes "Check all" and "Save" buttons, and an email address "23f1002071@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." indicating the logged-in user.

The screenshot displays a dashboard interface showing a student's ("ANVITHA VARRE") current courses at IIT Madras. Courses listed include "Tools in Data Science," "Business Data Management," "Machine Learning Techniques," and "Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using Python." Each course card shows the student's assignment scores for various weeks (e.g., "Week 1 Assignment - 5.00" for "Tools in Data Science"). The "Tools in Data Science" course has an "Absent" status for Week 2 Assignment. The user's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is displayed as "6.44."

The icon appears to be a red play button with a white triangle, which is insufficient to determine code, errors, UI elements, visualizations, or textual content related to technical issues in a data science context. I would need to see the actual screenshot of the forum content to analyze it.

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.  
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem )

I have completed and checked and even saved the assignment for GA2 and GA3, however it says that I was absent for both GA2 and GA3.

Please check my assignment and ensure that it has been corrected, since I have checked the website and I had submitted.

Thank you

Can you check your dashboard (not your seek portal, dashboard is where all your course cards are visible). I have been informed by Operations that the scores have been pushed for week 1 to week 4 (including the bonus mark for discourse post in week 4)

Hi Team,  
I have attended the Graded Assignment for Tools in Data Science for the week 4 and the saved scores says i have got 2 marks. ( TDS 2025 Jan GA4 - Data Sourcing).  
But in the evaluation it says i have not submitted the GA4 from this course. Can you please clarify the same.

Attached the screenshots for both

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays assessment results for "Module 1: Development Tools" in a data science course. The student received a score of 100 on "Graded Assignment 1," with a peer average of 99% and a median score of 100. The assignment was due on "26 Jan 2025" and is marked as "Submitted."  Links labeled "View Chart" are present below the "Your Score" and "Peer Average" columns, likely leading to visualizations of the scoring distribution.

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays tabular data seemingly from a data science course or assignment. The table contains columns with data entries such as "tds-2025-01-ga3", "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", and dates in the format "2025-02-06 01:13:34".  Numeric values "4.5, 9.5" and "3.5, 9.5" are also present, likely representing scores or numerical data points. The UI elements are rows in a table format, potentially representing data records for analysis. There are no visible error messages or data visualizations in the screenshot.



According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100)

Kind regards

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a student's view of a graded assignment on an IIT Madras online learning platform. The assignment "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and the student's current "Score: 0" is displayed, suggesting the deadline has passed. Recent saves are listed, indicating previous attempts scored "8," but a more recent score wasn't saved/submitted or calculated before the deadline. The user is logged in as "22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." Two questions are listed "Write documentation in Markdown" and "Compress an image," both worth 1 mark.



  
Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.

[@shubham6](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/shubham6) I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you.

Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks.

Kind regards
