> **Image Content:** *Here's a breakdown of the key information from the screenshot, presented as an analysis from an expert:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot appears to be from an online learning platform, likely a course interface for an IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) Bachelor of Science (BS) program in Data Science, given the email domain and specific mentions. The page displays details about a graded assignment or activity, user information, and a log of past progress.

1.  **Assignment/Activity Details:**
    *   **Deadline:** The activity "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This indicates a past deadline for the assignment.
    *   **Current Displayed Score:** The top bar shows "Score: 0".
    *   **Action Buttons:** "Check all" and "Save" buttons are present, suggesting the ability to review or save progress on the assignment.

2.  **Bonus Marks Opportunity:**
    *   **Purpose:** To encourage discussions among IITM BS students.
    *   **Eligibility:** Students who reply to a specific discussion thread with a relevant question or reply.
    *   **Award:** 1 bonus mark on "this graded assignment".
    *   **Target Discussion:** The Discourse thread linked is "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". This implies the current assignment is related to "GA4 - Data Sourcing" from the "TDS Jan 2025" (presumably "The Data Science" or "Data Science" batch of January 2025).

3.  **User Information:**
    *   **Logged-in User:** The user is logged in as `23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email format `[year_batch][course_id]@[domain]` is typical for IITM online programs.
    *   **Logout Option:** A "Logout" button is available.

4.  **Course Context (Handwritten Annotation):**
    *   A prominent handwritten annotation on the dark grey background reads "week 4". This strongly suggests that the displayed content pertains to the fourth week of the data science course.

5.  **Recent Saves/Score History:**
    *   **Header:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
    *   **Save Log:** The platform logs previous saves with timestamps and scores.
    *   **Score Discrepancy:** The most recent saves (from 9/2/2025, 8:04:05 pm and 8:03:25 pm) both show a "Score: 8". An earlier save (from 9/2/2025, 4:03:58 pm) shows a "Score: 4". Given the header states "most recent is your official score," the official score should be 8, which contradicts the "Score: 0" displayed in the top bar. This could indicate a pending update, a reset, or a specific submission process not fully reflected.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code blocks or traditional error messages visible. The "commands" are user interface actions:

*   **Buttons:**
    *   `Check all`
    *   `Save`
    *   `Logout`
*   **Links/Actions in Save Log:**
    *   `Reload` (appears next to each save entry)

**Textual Content:**

*   `Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST`
*   `Score: 0`
*   `Bonus marks for posting on Discourse`
*   `To encourage discussions, IITM BS students who reply to the discussion on GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] with a relevant question or reply will get 1 bonus mark on this graded assignment.`
*   `You are logged in as 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`
*   `week 4` (handwritten)
*   `Recent saves (most recent is your official score)`
*   `from 9/2/2025, 8:04:05 pm. Score: 8`
*   `from 9/2/2025, 8:03:25 pm. Score: 8`
*   `from 9/2/2025, 4:03:58 pm. Score: 4`*

    *   **Course Status:** "NEW COURSE" (indicating it might be a recently added course or one the user has just enrolled in).

2.  **Course Progress/Performance Snapshot:**
    *   **Assignment Grade:** The user has received a score for their "Week 1 Assignment".
    *   **Score:** The score is "87.50". This suggests a grading scale where 87.50 is a specific, possibly out of 100, numerical grade for that assignment.

3.  **Navigation/Call to Action:**
    *   **Button:** A prominent button labeled "Go to Course page >" is present, allowing the user to navigate directly to the full course content, syllabus, and further assignments. The ">" symbol typically indicates a link or navigation to another page.

[@24ds3000061](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

Sir, I have attempted the graded assignment 2 and also saved it but my score is showing as absent. Please look into the issue sir.  
My email id is 23f1002071@ds.study.iitm.ac.in



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user interface from an online learning platform, likely for a data science course, specifically related to an assignment or quiz submission.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

*   **Assignment/Task Status:** The task or assignment has **Ended** as of **Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST**. This indicates that the deadline has passed, and no further submissions or modifications are likely possible.
*   **Current Displayed Score:** A "Score: 0" is shown in the top bar. However, this is clarified by the "Recent saves" section below.
*   **User Information:** The user is logged in as **23f1002071@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**, which suggests a student ID from an IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) study program.
*   **Support/Communication:** A prompt "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" indicates that a forum (Discourse) is available for student support and discussion.
*   **Submission History and Official Score:**
    *   The section "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" clearly states how the final score is determined.
    *   The most recent save, and thus the **official score**, is **5.5** from 2/3/2025, 10:27:40 AM.
    *   There are two other previous saves:
        *   One from 2/2/2025, 7:29:26 PM, also with a score of **5.5**.
        *   An earlier save from 2/2/2025, 2:30:39 PM, with a score of **2**.
    *   Each saved attempt has a "Reload" button, suggesting the ability to review or revert to that specific state of the submission.
*   **Interface Elements:** Buttons for "Check all", "Save", and "Logout" are visible. Given the "Ended" status, "Check all" and "Save" are likely non-functional for new changes.

*   "6. **Use anything**. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want." (This indicates a highly open-resource exam environment.)
*   "7. **It's hackable**. It's possible to get the answer to *some* questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed." (This is a very unusual and significant rule, suggesting a deep technical or security-related aspect to the exam questions.)
*   **Note:** "You'll run multiple servers in this exam. *All of them* must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers." (Further emphasizes the technical, multi-server setup required for the assignment.)

**3. Support & Discussion:**
*   **Discussion Forum:** There's a section for questions: "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse". Discourse is a popular forum software.

**4. Recent Saves (Submission History):**
This section details the student's past saves and their scores. It explicitly states, "most recent is your official score."
*   **Official Score:** 8
*   **Save 1 (Most Recent / Official):** "Reload from 6/2/2025, 12:01:12 am. Score: 8" (This save occurred just after the stated deadline of Feb 5, 2025, 11:59 pm IST, suggesting a very close submission or a slight grace period.)
*   **Save 2:** "Reload from 5/2/2025, 11:57:05 pm. Score: 8"
*   **Save 3:** "Reload from 5/2/2025, 11:54:13 pm. Score: 6.5"

This is summary from start to finish + doubt clearing



> **Image Content:** *The provided image is a highly pixelated and blurry icon or logo.

**Key Information:**

*   **Content:** The image depicts a red horizontal rectangle with what appears to be rounded corners, set against a blurry dark green background or border.
*   **Central Element:** Prominently featured in the center of the red rectangle is a bright white, horizontally oriented triangle or arrow pointing to the right.
*   **Likely Interpretation:** This design is universally recognized as a "play button" icon. In the context of a data science course forum, this would almost certainly indicate a clickable link or embedded element that, when activated, would play a video. This video would likely be a lecture, tutorial, demonstration, or a supplementary resource, often hosted on platforms like YouTube (whose play button this icon strongly resembles).
*   **Quality:** The image is very low resolution and heavily pixelated, making fine details indistinguishable.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is no discernible code, commands, or error messages visible in this image. The image only contains a graphical icon.*


[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/NkUmOagUORE)



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing a screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the key information observed:

**Overall Context:**
This screenshot appears to be from an online video conferencing platform, specifically Google Meet. The primary content visible is a participant's profile picture against a black background, indicating a typical view when no screen is being shared, or a specific participant's video feed is selected. There is no visible data science-specific content such as code, plots, equations, or forum discussion text.

**Key Information:**

*   **Platform:** Google Meet (indicated by the logo and text in the top right corner).
*   **Identified Participant/User:** The name "Gokul Vasudevan S" is displayed in the bottom left corner, likely identifying the participant whose video feed or profile is shown.
*   **Visual Content:** The center of the screen features a circular profile image of a male individual.
    *   **Appearance:** The person has dark, curly hair and a beard, and is smiling towards the camera. He is wearing a yellow t-shirt.
    *   **Background in Profile Picture:** The background behind the person in the profile picture appears to be outdoors, possibly on a bridge or elevated walkway, with trees (resembling palm trees) visible in the distance.
    *   **Clothing Detail:** There is some partially visible text on the yellow t-shirt. It appears to read "Me Same" and then another line below it, possibly "Vibe", but it's not fully legible.

**Transcription of Visible Text (No code, commands, or error messages are present):**

*   **Top Right:** `Google Meet`
*   **Bottom Left:** `Gokul Vasudevan S`
*   **On T-shirt (partially visible):** `Me Same` (and some additional unclear text below it)*

    *   **Middle Section (behind "Week 5"):** A computer monitor with lines of code or data (programming, data display), a globe (global data, geospatial analysis), more bar charts and abstract network nodes.
    *   **Bottom Section (behind "Session 1"):** More geometric patterns, a wrench/screwdriver with network nodes (tools, engineering, problem-solving), line graphs/area charts (trends, time series), and a pie chart (proportions, categorical data).
*   **Overall Theme:** The iconography strongly reinforces the subject matter: data collection, analysis, visualization, machine learning, programming, and data engineering. It serves as a visual mnemonic for the broad topics covered in a data science curriculum.

**3. Purpose:**
*   This image functions as a clear separator or title card, helping students identify which part of the course content they are currently viewing or about to begin. It's a pedagogical tool to structure the learning experience.

**4. Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
*   There is **no code, commands, or error messages** present in this image. It is purely an informational and visual introductory slide.*

    *   Pencils (study, design)
    *   Computer screens (data processing, coding)
    *   Circuit board-like connections/networks (algorithms, data flow)
    *   Bar charts and pie charts (data visualization, analysis)
    *   A globe (global data, interconnectedness)
    *   Abstract geometric patterns (data structures, patterns)

You got 80 in ga4. And the bonus makes it to 90.

Thats what we have on our system.

Kindly post a screenshot of your dashboard if 90 is not showing for GA4

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, Now it’s showing “Absent” in both Week 1 & 2 GA :  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays key information from a data science course portal, likely an overview page for a specific student's progress in the course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Course Identification:**
    *   **Course Title:** "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed as the subject of this entry.
    *   **Course Status/Enrollment Type:** Below the title, it clearly states "REPEAT FULL COURSE." This is a crucial detail, indicating the student is retaking the entire course, which might explain some of the assignment statuses.

2.  **Assignment Progress and Grades:**
    *   The screenshot provides a chronological list of assignments for the first four weeks of the course, along with their respective statuses or scores.
    *   **Week 1 Assignment - Absent:** The student did not submit or was marked absent for the Week 1 assignment.
    *   **Week 2 Assignment - Absent:** Similar to Week 1, the student was absent for the Week 2 assignment.
    *   **Week 3 Assignment - 58.00:** The student received a score of 58.00 (presumably out of 100 or a similar scale) for the Week 3 assignment.
    *   **Week 4 Assignment - 80.00:** The student received a score of 80.00 for the Week 4 assignment, showing an improvement from Week 3.

3.  **Navigation/Action Item:**
    *   A clear call-to-action button is present at the bottom: "Go to Course page >". This indicates that clicking this button would navigate the user to the main page or dashboard for the "Tools in Data Science" course, likely where they can access course materials, submit assignments, or view more detailed progress.

**Observations:**
The assignment statuses suggest that the student may have started engaging with the course later (from Week 3 onwards) or that the "REPEAT FULL COURSE" status means they were only focusing on improving specific grades from later weeks, having already completed earlier material in a previous attempt.

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.  
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem )

Hi Team,  
I have attended the Graded Assignment for Tools in Data Science for the week 4 and the saved scores says i have got 2 marks. ( TDS 2025 Jan GA4 - Data Sourcing).  
But in the evaluation it says i have not submitted the GA4 from this course. Can you please clarify the same.

Attached the screenshots for both



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a page from a data science course forum or learning management system, likely related to a graded assignment. The interface is dark-themed.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Course/Assignment Details:**
*   **Title:** "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse"
*   **Deadline/End Date:** "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" (Indicating the activity concluded on this date/time).
*   **Current Displayed Score:** "Score: 0" (in the top bar, next to "Check all" and "Save" buttons).
*   **Objective:** To encourage discussions among "IITM BS students".
*   **Action Required:** Students need to "reply to the discussion on GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]".
*   **Conditions:** The reply must be a "relevant question or reply".
*   **Reward:** "1 bonus mark on this graded assignment".
*   **Specific Discussion Thread (Hyperlink):** "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]"

**2. User Information:**
*   **Logged-in User:** "You are logged in as 23f1002510@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   **Logout Option:** A "Logout" button is present below the user's email.
*   **Affiliation:** The email domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` strongly suggests the user is a student of the Data Science (DS) program at IIT Madras (IITM).

**3. Recent Activity/Scores:**
*   **Section Title:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
*   **Recorded Saves:**
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:59:45. Score: 2"
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:56:35. Score: 2"
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:44:29. Score: 2"
*   **Observation:** All three recent saves show a score of "2", which is higher than the "Score: 0" displayed in the top bar. The most recent save (23:59:45 on 09/02/2025) is stated to be the "official score." All saves occurred on the same day as the deadline, suggesting the user submitted or had their activity recorded just before the cut-off.

**4. Interface Elements:**
*   **Buttons:** "Check all", "Save", "Reload" (for each recent save entry), "Logout".
*   **Top Bar Icons:** A dropdown or profile icon on the far right.
*   **System Time/Date (from user's desktop taskbar):** 19:29 (7:29 PM) on 18-02-2025 (February 18, 2025). This indicates the screenshot was taken after the assignment's end date (Feb 9, 2025).

**Summary of Inconsistencies/Points of Interest:**
*   The "Score: 0" in the top bar contradicts the "Score: 2" shown in the "Recent saves" section as the official score. This could mean the top bar score reflects the *base* score before bonus marks are applied, or it's a display lag.
*   The assignment encourages interaction on "Discourse", which is a popular open-source forum software, indicating the course uses an external forum for discussions.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
No specific code, commands, or error messages appear. However, the following text strings are exact transcriptions of critical information:

*   **User Email:** `23f1002510@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Discussion Thread Name:** `GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]`*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a student's dashboard or portal for the IIT Madras Degree in Data Science and Applications, accessible via a mobile browser. It provides a concise overview of the student's current academic status and progress in a specific course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Platform and User Context:**
*   **Institution:** IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras).

[@22f3000935](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3000935) I can confirm that your score 77.5 was after midnight of the deadline. Your actual score before the deadline it was 70.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log or record from what appears to be a grading or submission system within a data science course forum. It shows multiple entries, likely detailing submissions or grade updates for a single student on a specific assignment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information presented in a tabular format:

**Key Information:**

The image displays four rows of data, each containing the following columns:

*   **Assignment ID / Course Identifier:** `tds-2025-01-ga1`
    *   This identifier appears consistently across all entries.
    *   `tds` likely stands for "The Data Science" or a similar course prefix.
    *   `2025-01` probably indicates the course year and month (January 2025).
    *   `ga1` most likely refers to "Graded Assignment 1."

*   **Student Identifier / Email:** `22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   This is a unique identifier for a student, presented as an email address.
    *   `22f3000935` appears to be a student ID number.
    *   `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` strongly indicates that this is from the Data Science (ds) study program of IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras).

*   **Timestamp:**
    *   `2025-01-27 00:00:23` (for the first two rows)
    *   `2025-01-26 23:59:01` (for the last two rows)
    *   These timestamps indicate when the submission was made or when the grade was recorded/updated. The difference in timestamps suggests multiple attempts or a re-evaluation/update of the assignment score.

*   **Score Obtained:**
    *   `7.75` (for the first two rows)
    *   `7` (for the last two rows)
    *   This represents the score achieved by the student for the assignment.

*   **Maximum Score:** `10`
    *   This value is consistent across all entries and indicates that the assignment was graded out of 10.

**Analysis and Interpretation:**

The log likely shows records for student `22f3000935` on "Graded Assignment 1" of the `tds-2025-01` course at IIT Madras.

*   The two bottom rows indicate an earlier record where the student scored `7` out of `10`, submitted or recorded at `2025-01-26 23:59:01`.
*   The two top rows indicate a later record where the student improved their score to `7.75` out of `10`, submitted or recorded at `2025-01-27 00:00:23`. This suggests the student either resubmitted the assignment and received a higher grade, or there was a re-evaluation/update to their existing score. The repetition of each specific timestamp and score pair (e.g., `2025-01-27 00:00:23` and `7.75` appearing twice) might indicate a system's logging behavior (e.g., a "before" and "after" state, or simply redundant logging) rather than four distinct attempts.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is no code, command, or error message present in the image. The content is purely data in a tabular format.*

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a gradebook or submission log for a data science course. It shows details of quiz attempts for a specific student.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Table Headers:**

*   **Quiz:** Identifies the specific quiz.
*   **Email:** The email address of the student who submitted the quiz.
*   **Time:** The timestamp of the quiz submission.
*   **Total:** The score obtained by the student on that specific attempt.
*   **Max:** The maximum possible score for the quiz.

**Key Information and Observations:**

*   **Quiz Identity:** Both entries are for the same quiz, identified as `tds-2025-01-ga3`. This likely refers to a Data Science course (tds), in the first semester/module of 2025, and potentially "Graded Assignment 3" (ga3).
*   **Student Identity:** Both entries belong to the **same student**, identified by the email address `21f3000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This indicates a student from a data science study program at IIT Madras.
*   **Multiple Attempts/Submissions:** The presence of two rows for the exact same quiz and student, but with different timestamps, strongly suggests that the student submitted or attempted the quiz multiple times.
*   **Submission Timestamps and Scores:**
    *   **Attempt 1:** Submitted on `2025-02-06` at `18:53:58` (6:53:58 PM). The student scored `7` out of a maximum of `9.5`.
    *   **Attempt 2:** Submitted on `2025-02-06` at `22:01:38` (10:01:38 PM). This is a later submission on the same day. The student scored `6` out of a maximum of `9.5`.
*   **Score Change:** Interestingly, the student's score *decreased* from 7 to 6 in their later attempt. Depending on the course policy, the best score (7) might be taken, or perhaps the last attempt counts.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The data is purely tabular information regarding quiz submissions.*

[@23f2004320](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2004320)

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

[@23f1002223](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002223)



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a tabular log, likely from a data science course's grading or submission system. It tracks the activity of a specific student for a particular assignment, showing multiple attempts or updates.

Here's a breakdown of the key information presented:

1.  **Assignment/Course Identifier (Column 1):**
    *   **Value:** `tds-2025-01-ga3`
    *   **Description:** This identical value across all rows likely refers to a specific graded assignment or component within a course. "tds" could stand for "The Data Science" or a similar course prefix. "2025-01" might indicate the year and semester/month, and "ga3" could mean "Graded Assignment 3".

2.  **Student/User Identifier (Column 2):**
    *   **Value:** `23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   **Description:** This is an email address, which is consistent across all entries. It identifies the student whose submissions/scores are being logged. The domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` strongly suggests this is from a data science program at IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras). `23f1002223` is likely the student's unique ID or roll number.

3.  **Timestamp (Column 3):**
    *   **Value 1:** `2025-02-06 01:13:34` (Latest entry)
    *   **Value 2:** `2025-02-06 00:22:25`
    *   **Value 3:** `2025-02-05 23:59:07` (Earliest entry)
    *   **Description:** These timestamps indicate the date and time of each log entry, likely corresponding to submission attempts, grading updates, or a record of specific actions. The entries are ordered by recency, with the latest at the top. Notice the quick succession of submissions/updates around midnight of Feb 5th/6th.

4.  **Score Obtained (Column 4):**
    *   **Value 1:** `4.5`
    *   **Value 2:** `4.5`
    *   **Value 3:** `3.5`
    *   **Description:** This column shows the student's score for this assignment component. The score improved from `3.5` to `4.5` between the earliest entry (2025-02-05 23:59:07) and the subsequent entries (2025-02-06 00:22:25 and 2025-02-06 01:13:34). This suggests the student either resubmitted, received a re-grade, or completed additional components that increased their score.

5.  **Maximum Possible Score / Second Score Component (Column 5):**
    *   **Value:** `9.5` (Consistent across all entries)
    *   **Description:** This value remains constant for all entries. It most likely represents the maximum possible score for the assignment or for the specific component being graded (out of which the student scored 3.5 or 4.5). Alternatively, it could be a second, fixed component of a combined score. Given the context of a student improving a variable score, it's highly probable that `9.5` is the total points available for the `3.5`/`4.5` part of the assignment.

**In summary:** The screenshot provides a log of a specific student's (`23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) performance on an assignment (`tds-2025-01-ga3`) in a data science course at IIT Madras. It shows three recorded events, with the student's score improving from `3.5` to `4.5` out of `9.5` over a short period between February 5th and 6th, 2025.*



According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100)

Kind regards

*February 20, 2025, 18:46 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot, detailing the key information and transcribing relevant text:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Assignment Context:** The page is for a "Graded Assignment 2" within a data science course, specifically "TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment," likely part of the "IITM-PDS - Data Sci..." program (presumably IIT Madras Professional Diploma in Data Science). The URL is `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2`.
2.  **Assignment Status and Deadline:** A prominent red banner at the top indicates the assignment has concluded: "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".
3.  **Current Displayed Score:** Despite previous saves, the main display shows a "Score: 0".
4.  **User Information:** The user is logged in as "22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
5.  **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" details three past attempts or saves:
    *   The most recent save, listed as the "official score," is from "2/3/2025, 12:00:30 AM" with a "Score: 8".
    *   Two earlier saves are from "2/2/2025, 11:53:32 PM" and "2/2/2025, 11:53:30 PM", both also showing a "Score: 8".
6.  **Visible Questions:** Two questions are partially visible at the bottom of the page, each worth 1 mark:
    1.  "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)"
    2.  "Compress an image (1 mark)"

**Analysis and Observations:**

*   **Score Discrepancy:** The most critical piece of information is the contradiction between the "Score: 0" displayed at the top of the page and the "Score: 8" recorded for all "Recent saves."
*   **Deadline vs. Saves:** The assignment ended at "11:59 pm IST" on "2 Feb, 2025".
    *   Two of the recorded saves ("11:53:32 PM" and "11:53:30 PM" on 2/2/2025) occurred *before* the deadline.
    *   The "most recent save" ("12:00:30 AM" on 2/3/2025) occurred *after* the deadline.
*   The instruction "most recent is your official score" from the "Recent saves" section, when combined with the "Score: 0" at the top, suggests that even though the last save recorded a score of 8, it might have been registered after the deadline, leading to a zero score for the assignment despite earlier, on-time saves also showing a score of 8. This indicates a potential issue with how the system processes late submissions or finalizes scores when deadlines are involved.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code blocks, command-line commands, or traditional error messages displayed. The relevant status messages and score displays are:

*   **Status Message:** "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
*   **Displayed Score:** "Score: 0" (in the red banner)
*   **Saved Scores:**
    *   "Score: 8" (associated with the save from 2/3/2025, 12:00:30 AM)
    *   "Score: 8" (associated with the save from 2/2/2025, 11:53:32 PM)
    *   "Score: 8" (associated with the save from 2/2/2025, 11:53:30 PM)*



  
Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
