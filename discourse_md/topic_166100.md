Hi [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) & [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

I was wondering if we can have access to the companion notebook for the application for order built on 31st Jan 2025. Where can we access this ?

Hi Vikram,

Those notebooks are for internal purpose only, we donâ€™t use to share them.

Kind regards
