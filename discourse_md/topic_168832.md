*March 02, 2025, 07:05 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a web page from what appears to be an online learning or examination platform, likely for a data science course, given the context. The page presents two main sections: general troubleshooting advice and a specific error message.

### Key Information:

1.  **General Troubleshooting Advice:** The top section, titled "Trouble seeing questions?", provides a list of common solutions for display or access issues on the website. These suggestions primarily focus on browser configuration and security software interference, indicating that the site relies on modern browser features and may conflict with privacy-enhancing tools.
    *   **Browser Compatibility:** Recommends using Chrome or Edge, emphasizing the need for a "modern, not-too-privacy-sensitive browser."
    *   **Cookie/Ad Blockers:** Notes that the site uses "third-party cookies for authentication," suggesting that ad or cookie blockers might interfere with login or session management.
    *   **JavaScript Dependency:** States that JavaScript is "required for this site," implying functionality relies heavily on client-side scripting.
    *   **Browser Extensions/Modes:** Advises trying "Incognito or InPrivate mode" without extensions, pointing to potential conflicts with installed browser add-ons.
    *   **Antivirus Software:** Suggests disabling "aggressive anti-virus software," indicating that some security programs might mistakenly block necessary site components.

2.  **Specific Error Message:** The bottom section, highlighted in a red box, presents a critical error that the user is currently facing. This error is distinct from the general troubleshooting advice and points to a problem with accessing a specific resource.
    *   **Error Type:** Indicates an inability to locate a specific quiz.
    *   **Quiz Identifier:** The missing quiz is precisely identified by the ID `tds-2025-01-roe`. This format suggests a structured naming convention, possibly indicating a "The Data Science" or "Technical Data Science" course, year (2025), and a specific module or version (`01-roe`).
    *   **Suggested Cause:** The system suggests the user "might have the wrong link," implying the link used to access the quiz is incorrect, outdated, or perhaps the quiz itself has been moved or removed.
    *   **Resolution Path:** Instructs the user to "contact the exam team for assistance," indicating that user-side troubleshooting (like those listed above) is unlikely to resolve this particular error, and intervention from the platform's support or administration is required.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

**Trouble seeing questions?**
1.  Try with Chrome or Edge. This site needs a modern, not-too-privacy-sensitive browser.
2.  Disable ad or cookie blockers. This site uses third-party cookies for authentication.
3.  Enable JavaScript. It's required for this site.
4.  Try without browser extensions in Incognito or InPrivate mode.
5.  Try disabling aggressive anti-virus software.

*March 02, 2025, 07:09 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user encountering an error while trying to access an online technical assessment or quiz.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Context:** The user is attempting to access a "Technical Assessment" via a web browser (Google Chrome, evident from the UI). The browser's bookmark bar shows links to various educational and programming-related sites (e.g., "IIT Madras Online...", "FC - Replit", "Code Chef", "Online Courses", "stats 2 live sessions", "Probability and St..."), suggesting this is from a student in a data science or programming course.

2.  **Accessed URL:** The user is trying to reach the following URL:
    `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`

3.  **Troubleshooting Recommendations (General):** Before displaying the specific error, the page lists general troubleshooting steps under the heading "Trouble seeing questions?". These are common issues with online assessment platforms:
    *   `1. Try with Chrome or Edge. This site needs a modern, not-too-privacy-sensitive browser.`
    *   `2. Disable ad or cookie blockers. This site uses third-party cookies for authentication.`
    *   `3. Enable JavaScript. It's required for this site.`
    *   `4. Try without browser extensions in Incognito or InPrivate mode.`
    *   `5. Try disabling aggressive anti-virus software.`

4.  **Specific Error Message (Exact Transcription):** A prominent red error box is displayed at the bottom, indicating the core problem.
    *   `Error!`
    *   `Sorry, we couldn't find the quiz tds-2025-01-roe. You might have the wrong link.`
    *   `Please contact the exam team for assistance.`

**Summary of the Problem:** The user is unable to access the technical assessment/quiz. The system explicitly states it cannot find the quiz identified as `tds-2025-01-roe` and suggests that the user might be using an incorrect link.

**Action Recommended:** The user is advised to contact the exam team for assistance.*

*March 02, 2025, 07:10 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's the breakdown of the provided image:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The image most likely represents a common "relatable content" or "off-topic" post shared by a student in a data science course forum. It's a humorous depiction of the challenges or distractions of remote learning or working from home.
2.  **Subject:** A domestic cat (tabby, grey/brown stripes, green eyes) is prominently featured, lying directly on the keyboard of a laptop.
3.  **Activity:** The cat appears intently focused on the laptop screen, with its paws stretched out towards it. This suggests a humorous "pet interfering with work/study" scenario.
4.  **Equipment:**
    *   **Laptop:** An open laptop, identifiable by the "VAIO" logo on its lid (indicating a Sony VAIO model). The screen appears dark or off, or displaying something very dark.
    *   **Mouse:** A red and black wireless mouse is visible to the left of the laptop.
    *   **Cables:** Several cables are visible on the surface around the laptop, suggesting a typical home workspace setup.
5.  **Implied User Status:** The student (owner of the laptop and cat) is likely attempting to work on data science assignments, coding, or attending online lectures, but their workspace has been "commandeered" by their pet.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **None visible.** The image does not contain any legible code, command-line outputs, or error messages. This reinforces the interpretation that it's a non-technical, social post rather than a debugging query.

**(Hypothetical/Humorous interpretation if this were a *real* forum post accompanying the image):**
While no code or errors are visible in the image itself, if this were a forum post, the accompanying text might contain a humorous "error message" or "command" related to the cat's presence, such as:

*   "Error: Keyboard occupied by furry supervisor. Unable to execute `python myscript.py`"
*   "Command: `pet.distract()` executed successfully."
*   "My current debugging process involves trying to move this fluffy debugger."
*   "Any tips for dealing with `KernelInterruptedByCatError`?"*

Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used.  
But, I want to thank for mock sessions , appreciate all you TA‚Äôs efforts in last week. Take care

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user working on an online data science exam or course, specifically a programming task involving a FastAPI server. The user is attempting to debug their solution based on feedback from the exam system and their own API testing tool.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Exam/Course Platform (Left Pane):**

*   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roeffhq-stackoverflow-commo...` indicates an online testing environment.
*   **Time Remaining:** `00:26:36 left` shows a timed examination.
*   **Current Score:** `Score: 0 / 10`, implying the user has not yet successfully completed any tasks.
*   **Navigation/Controls:** "Check all", "Save" buttons are present.
*   **Question List:** The visible questions are related to data science topics:
    *   `7. LLM Embeddings (1 mark)`
    *   `8. Region Containing Point (1 mark)`
    *   `9. Shortest Path Between Cities (1 mark)`
    *   `10. Calculate correlation (1 mark)`
*   **Current Task (Question 1):**
    *   **Title:** `1 Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)`
    *   **Description:** "Write a FastAPI proxy server that serves the data from the given URL but also adds a CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to the response."
        *   This highlights two core requirements: proxying external content and correctly setting a CORS header.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        *   "For example, if your API URL endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, then a request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fkey%3Dvalue` should return the data from `https://example.com/?key=value` but with the CORS header."
        *   The example demonstrates URL encoding for the `url` query parameter.
    *   **Important Note:** `Note: Keep your server running for the duration of the exam.`
    *   **User Input Field:** "What is your FastAPI Proxy URL endpoint?"
        *   **Entered Value:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
        *   **Error Message:** `Error: Incorrect response` - This indicates that while the server might be reachable, its response (content, headers, or both) does not meet the exam system's criteria.
    *   **Validation Hint:** `We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?url=... check if the response matches the data.`

**2. Visual Studio Code Environment (Right Pane):**

*   **Open Files:** `q1.py` (likely the Python script for the current problem) and `q7_test.py` are open in tabs.
*   **Thunder Client Extension:** This VS Code extension is used for testing API requests.
    *   **Request Type:** `GET`
    *   **Request URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%252F%3F`
    *   **Query Parameters:** A `url` parameter is checked with the value `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%252F%3F`.
    *   **Response Details:**
        *   **Status:** `200 OK` - This is crucial. It shows that the local FastAPI server is indeed responding successfully to the Thunder Client request.
        *   **Size:** `1.29 KB`
        *   **Time:** `2.00 s`
        *   **Response Body (HTML - exact transcription):**
            ```html
            }\n@media (max-width: 700px) {\n div {\n margin: 0 auto;\n width: auto;\n }\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div>\n<h1>Example Domain</h1>\n<p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this\n domain in literature without prior coordination or asking\n for permission.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.iana.org\n/domains/example\">More information...</a></p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n
            ```
            *   This is the HTML content of `example.com`, confirming the proxy successfully fetched the external data.

*   **Terminal Panel:**
    *   This panel displays logs from the running FastAPI server (likely Uvicorn).
    *   **Server Logs (exact transcription):**
        ```
        %2Fget%3Fx%3D91141 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:51258 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D91141 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:51266 - "GET /api HTTP/1.1" 422 Unprocessable Entity
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:51268 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fkey%3Dvalue HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:51270 - "OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D92948 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        INFO: 127.0.0.1:51272 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D92948 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
        ```
    *   **Analysis of Logs:**
        *   Multiple `GET` requests to `/api` with various `url` parameters (e.g., `httpbin.org`, `example.com`) are shown, most returning `200 OK`. This confirms the proxy functionality is working for different external URLs.
        *   One `GET /api HTTP/1.1" 422 Unprocessable Entity` indicates a request to `/api` without the required `url` parameter, which is expected behavior.
        *   Crucially, there is an `OPTIONS` request: `INFO: 127.0.0.1:51270 - "OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D92948 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`. The presence of `OPTIONS` requests strongly suggests the client (or the exam validator) is performing CORS preflight checks.

**Key Problem and Potential Issue:**

The main discrepancy is that Thunder Client shows a `200 OK` and the correct proxied content, but the exam system returns "Error: Incorrect response". Given the explicit requirement to add a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` CORS header and the appearance of `OPTIONS` requests in the server logs, the most probable reason for the "Incorrect response" error is that **the FastAPI server is not correctly adding the required CORS header to its responses, or not properly handling CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests.** Thunder Client, as an API development tool, might not enforce CORS policies as strictly as a browser or a specialized validation system would, leading to a successful request in Thunder Client even if CORS headers are missing.*



  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)

Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000573)  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode  


> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot appears to be a segment of a user interface, likely from an online data science platform or a forum that integrates coding environments. It displays information about "Recent saves," suggesting a feature for version control, progress tracking, or autosave functionality for user work (e.g., notebooks, scripts, or forum drafts).

The core information presented is:
*   **"Recent saves"**: This is the title of the section, indicating its purpose.
*   **Timestamp of a save**: "3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM" is explicitly shown as the date and time of a save. This is a future date, which could be a placeholder, an example, or indicative of a test environment.
*   **"Reload" button**: A clickable button is present, suggesting the user can refresh the list of saves or reload a specific saved state.
*   **Partial context**: The text "(most recent is your..." implies that the listed save (or the primary save being referenced) is the user's most recent one. The text "PM. S..." further suggests that there is more descriptive information about the save that is currently truncated.

Hello [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it‚Äôs showing 0 and dint get submitted properly‚Ä¶

As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a web page from an online examination platform for a data science course at IIT Madras.

Here's a detailed analysis of the key information:

**1. General Context & Platform Details:**
*   **Browser:** Google Chrome, running in "InPrivate" mode.
*   **URL:** `https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe` (Suggests an exam for "TDS 2025-01 ROE", likely "Remote Online Exam").
*   **Page Title:** "Remote Online Exam [TDS Jan 2025 ROE]".
*   **Institution:** Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), as indicated by the email domain and specific mentions like "(IITM students only)".
*   **Dark Mode:** The interface uses a dark theme.

**2. Exam Status and Deadlines:**
*   **Exam End Time:** The exam has officially ended, displayed in a prominent red banner at the top:
    `Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 PM IST`
*   **Bonus Mark Opportunity:** There's a section for a "Bonus mark". Students are instructed to fill out a form:
    `Please fill out this form before 5 pm IST to get a bonus mark. Details of the bonus are in the form description. (This is for IITM students only.)`
    The link `this form` is a hyperlink. Given the exam ended at 1:45 PM, the 5 PM IST deadline for the bonus mark is likely on the same day (March 2, 2025).

**3. User Information and Session Details:**
*   **Login Status:** The user is logged in, and their institutional email address is displayed:
    `You are logged in as 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`
    The `21f2000588` part is likely their student ID.
*   **Logout Option:** A `Logout` button is available.

**4. Score and Save History:**
*   **Current/Official Score:** At the top of the page, next to the "Ended" message, the score is shown as:
    `Score: 0`
*   **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" details past attempts/saves:
    *   Most Recent Save:
        `Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:42:55 PM. Score: 0`
    *   Earlier Save:
        `Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:42:34 PM. Score: 10`
    *   **Observation:** The user had a score of 10 at 1:42:34 PM, but their final official score at 1:42:55 PM (and currently displayed) is 0. This suggests either a submission issue, an automatic scoring recalculation, or perhaps actions taken after achieving the score of 10 led to it becoming 0.

**5. Support and Communication Channels:**
*   A teal-colored box provides contact information for support, specifically for IITM students:
    `Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)`
    `Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)`

**6. Page Structure:**
*   The page is divided into sections, with "Bonus mark" and "Recent saves" clearly delineated. Below the "Recent saves" section, a heading `Questions` indicates where the actual exam questions would appear, though they are not visible in this screenshot.

**7. System Information (from Taskbar):**
*   **Date and Time:** The system clock shows `1:58 PM` on `3/2/2025`. This is **after** the exam officially ended at 1:45 PM IST on the same day, confirming the user is viewing a completed exam.*



Hoping for a positive response from your side sir.  
Thanks & Regards

Hello [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot depicts a user's dashboard or status page within an online learning or assignment submission platform, likely associated with a data science course at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

*   **User Authentication Status:**
    *   The top section clearly indicates the user's logged-in status.
    *   **Transcribed Text:** `You are logged in as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`
    *   This specifies a unique student ID (`22f100055`) and the institutional domain (`ds.study.iitm.ac.in`), which points to a data science program at IITM.
    *   A `Logout` button with a red outline is present, allowing the user to terminate their session.

*   **Recent Saves/Submissions:**
    *   A prominent green-bordered section titled `Recent saves` is displayed.
    *   An important note follows the title: `(most recent is your official score)`. This clarifies that students can have multiple attempts or saves, but only the latest one will count towards their final grade.
    *   Two distinct "saves" are listed:
        *   **Save 1 (Most Recent):**
            *   Includes a `Reload` button.
            *   **Transcribed Information:** `from 3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM. Score: 8`
        *   **Save 2:**
            *   Includes a `Reload` button.
            *   **Transcribed Information:** `from 3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM. Score: 8`

**Key Observations and Interpretation:**

*   **Platform Purpose:** This interface is likely used for submitting assignments or tracking progress in a data science course, where students might submit code, notebooks, or answers that are automatically graded.
*   **Version Control/Attempts:** The "Recent saves" feature with "Reload" buttons suggests that the platform allows users to save their work incrementally or make multiple attempts at an assignment. The "Reload" button implies the ability to revert to or review a previous state of their submission.
*   **Scoring System:** Scores are assigned to each save. Both recorded saves here received a score of `8`. The explicit statement "most recent is your official score" is crucial for students to understand how their final grade is determined.
*   **Timestamping:** Each save is meticulously timestamped, including the date, hour, minute, second, and AM/PM.
*   **Future Date Anomaly:** It's noteworthy that the save dates are `3/2/2025`, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming the screenshot was taken recently). This could indicate a test environment, a placeholder for a future course instance, or a common practice in certain educational platforms to pre-populate data.

**No explicit code, commands, or error messages are visible in this screenshot other than the button labels and transcribed text mentioned above.***



I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.

Please consider accepting my submission

Thanks so much and best regards,

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures the output of a data science operation within what appears to be a Jupyter Notebook or a similar interactive Python environment. The core task being performed is the extraction of tabular data from a PDF file.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Environment Setup & Dependencies:**
The initial lines show that several Python packages are already installed and satisfy the requirements, indicating a well-prepared data science environment. These packages are crucial for the subsequent PDF data extraction:
*   `tabula-py` (v2.10.0): This is the primary library for extracting tables from PDFs.
*   `pandas` (v2.2.2): Used for data manipulation, particularly for handling the extracted tabular data in DataFrame format.
*   `numpy` (v1.26.4): A fundamental library for numerical operations, often a dependency for pandas.
*   `distro` (v1.9.0): Likely used for detecting the operating system distribution.
*   `python-dateutil` (v2.8.2), `pytz` (v2025.1), `tzdata` (v2025.1): These are related to date and time handling, often dependencies for pandas.
*   `six` (v1.17.0): A Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.

**2. File Selection and Processing:**
The user has interacted with a file selection interface, choosing a PDF file for processing.
*   **Input File:** `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf`
*   **File Details:** It's an `application/pdf` file, `167477 bytes` in size, and was last modified on `02/03/2025`. The future date for last modification suggests this might be a test file or an environment with a non-standard system clock setting.
*   **Processing Status:** The extraction process completed `100% done`.
*   **Output File (Intermediate/Side-effect):** The process indicates it is "Saving q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2) (1).pdf". This implies the tool might create an output PDF file as part of its operation, possibly containing the extracted tables or a processed version of the original PDF.

**3. Warnings/Error Messages (Non-critical):**
The output includes warnings related to `tabula.backend` and `org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType1Font <init>`. These indicate that during the PDF processing, certain fonts (Symbol and ZapfDingbats) were not found, and `LiberationSans` was used as a fallback.
*   These are **warnings**, not critical errors, meaning the extraction process likely proceeded successfully despite the font substitution. This is common when dealing with various PDF documents that might embed or reference diverse font types.
*   The timestamp in the warnings (`Mar 02, 2025 8:43:55 AM`) aligns with the "last modified" date of the input file.

**4. Extracted Data (Pandas DataFrame):**
The most crucial part of the output is the successfully extracted tabular data. It's displayed as a Pandas DataFrame.
*   **Content:** The table contains student scores for `Maths`, `Physics`, `English`, `Economics`, `Biology`, and a `Group` column (which consistently shows '1').
*   **Shape:** It has 5 rows of data (indexed 0-4) and 6 columns.

**5. Data Types (`dtypes`):**
Following the DataFrame display, the data types of each column are shown, confirming that all subject scores and the 'Group' column were successfully parsed as `int64` (integer) values. The overall DataFrame `dtype` is `object`.

**6. Final Numerical Output:**
The number `34919` appears at the very end. Without the specific code cell that generated this output, its exact meaning is uncertain. It could represent:
*   A memory address of the last object.
*   A unique ID or hash related to the processed data or the session.
*   A line count or byte count from an underlying process.
It is not an error message.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online data science course or assessment platform, presenting a numerical problem that requires data filtering and aggregation.

Here's the key information:

1.  **The Question:**
    The problem asks for a specific calculation based on a dataset (presumably student scores).
    **Exact Transcription:**
    "What is the total **Biology** marks of students who scored **30** or more marks in **Maths** in groups **1-28** (including both groups)?"

    *   **Analysis of the Question:**
        *   The objective is to find the **sum** of "Biology marks".
        *   This sum is conditional on two criteria for students:
            1.  Their "Maths" score must be "30 or more".
            2.  They must belong to "groups 1-28" (inclusive).
        *   The highlighted words (Biology, 30, Maths, 1-28) likely refer to columns, thresholds, or categories within the underlying dataset.

2.  **User's Input/Attempt:**
    The user has entered a numerical value into an answer field.
    **Exact Transcription:**
    `34919`

    *   **Analysis of Input:**
        *   The input field is visually marked with a red border and an exclamation mark icon (!), indicating a validation error or an incorrect submission.

3.  **System Feedback/Error Message:**
    Directly below the input field, there's a message indicating the status of the user's answer.
    **Exact Transcription:**
    `Incorrect. Try again.`

    *   **Analysis of Error:**
        *   This message confirms that the submitted answer `34919` is wrong. The user needs to re-evaluate their calculation and attempt the problem again.

**Key Information and Context (Expert Analysis):**

*   This is a classic data aggregation problem common in data science. Users would typically solve this using tools like Python with the Pandas library (e.g., `df[(df['Maths'] >= 30) & (df['Group'].between(1, 28))]['Biology'].sum()`), SQL (e.g., `SELECT SUM(Biology_Marks) FROM Students WHERE Maths_Marks >= 30 AND Group_ID BETWEEN 1 AND 28;`), or spreadsheet functions (like `SUMIFS`).
*   The error suggests that the user's calculation based on the given conditions did not yield the correct total. This could be due to:
    *   Incorrectly filtering the Maths scores (e.g., using `>` instead of `>=`).
    *   Incorrectly defining the group range (e.g., excluding group 1 or 28, or using wrong group IDs).
    *   An arithmetic error in summing the Biology marks for the filtered students.
    *   Using a wrong or incomplete dataset.*



i dont understand why its wrong

you have to filter students with marks 30 or more in maths not biology and then answer to question is total biology mark you have found the total maths mark

So sir you can please verify with your records and i hope you grant me full marks for this ROE sir.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online learning platform, likely a portal for assignments or quizzes in a data science course. It displays the current status of an ongoing assessment.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Assessment Status:**
    *   **Time Remaining:** `00:19:29 left` (19 minutes and 29 seconds remaining).
    *   **Current Score:** `Score: 10 / 10`, indicating a perfect score achieved.
    *   **Actions:** Buttons for `Check all` and `Save` are visible.

2.  **Support and Communication:**
    *   The platform provides specific links for student support:
        *   `Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)` (for general questions/forum)
        *   `Techical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)` (for technical support, note the typo "Techical")
    *   This indicates the course is affiliated with IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) and likely restricted to their students.

3.  **User Information:**
    *   The user is logged in as `21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`. This is likely a student ID and domain indicating a "data science study" program at IITM.
    *   A `Logout` button is present.

4.  **Recent Saves History:**
    *   A section titled `Recent saves (most recent is your official score)` tracks the user's progress.
    *   It shows three past saves, with `Reload` buttons next to each:
        *   `from 3/2/2025, 1:21:26 PM. Score: 10` (This is the latest and official score)
        *   `from 3/2/2025, 1:20:01 PM. Score: 10`
        *   `from 3/2/2025, 1:17:02 PM. Score: 9`
    *   The dates (March 2, 2025) are in the future, suggesting this might be a test environment, a placeholder, or a system using a future date for some reason. The history shows the student improved from a score of 9 to a perfect 10.

5.  **Questions Section:**
    *   The beginning of the "Questions" section is visible.
    *   The first question listed is: `1. Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)`. This indicates a practical programming assignment, likely involving Python and the FastAPI web framework, common in data science for deploying models or services.

Hello [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today‚Äôs ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?  
Thank you.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the results or status page of an online assessment or exam, likely for a data science course, accessed via a web browser.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assessment Context:**
*   The URL indicates the platform is `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`.
    *   `exam.sanand.workers.dev` suggests an examination system, possibly hosted on Cloudflare Workers.
    *   `tds-2025-01-roe` likely refers to "The Data Science" course (or similar acronym), for the 2025-01 cohort, with "roe" being a specific exam or module identifier.

**2. Exam Status and Official End Time:**
*   A prominent red bar at the top indicates the exam has concluded.
*   **"Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST"**
    *   This clearly states the exact date and time the assessment ended, including the time zone (IST - Indian Standard Time).

**3. Main Displayed Score:**
*   In the red bar, next to the end time, a score is displayed:
    *   **"Score: 0"**
    *   This appears to be the overall or final score for the assessment as presented on this page.

**4. Recent Saves / Submission History:**
*   A green box titled **"Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"** provides a history of the user's progress and submissions.
*   This section explicitly states that the most recent save determines the official score.
*   Three recent save entries are visible, each with a "Reload" button (presumably to view the state of the exam at that specific save point).

**5. Transcribed Save Details:**
*   **Command/Action:** `Reload`
*   **Save 1 (Most Recent):** `from 3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM. Score: 10`
*   **Save 2:** `from 3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM. Score: 10`
*   **Save 3 (Earliest Visible):** `from 3/2/2025, 1:41:33 PM. Score: 10`

**Key Discrepancy/Issue:**
The most significant piece of information is the **discrepancy between the "Score: 0" displayed in the main red header and the "Score: 10" consistently shown across all "Recent saves" entries, especially the "most recent" one.** According to the text "most recent is your official score", the score should be 10, not 0. This suggests a potential grading error, a display bug, or a delay in updating the overall score.

**Other Visible Elements:**
*   A partially visible button/link next to "Score: 0" likely says "Check answers" or "Check again", implying a review function.
*   Standard browser navigation controls (back, forward, reload) and the URL bar are visible.

**No code, commands (other than the "Reload" button label), or explicit error messages are transcribed beyond the data points described above.***



  
Sir, I‚Äôm facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.  
Thank you.

Hi [@21f3002158](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f3002158)

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn‚Äôt click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA‚Äôs where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can‚Äôt do any help with this.

    *   For "Technical issues," an "OPTIONAL" Google Meet link is provided.
    *   Both support channels are exclusively for "IITM students only."

4.  **User Authentication:**
    *   The user is logged in as "24f2003130@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", indicating their student ID and institutional email from IITM's data science study program.
    *   A "Logout" button is available.

5.  **Submission History:**
    *   The "Recent saves" section confirms that the "most recent is your official score."
    *   Three save instances are listed, all on "2/3/2025" (March 2nd, 2025, given the exam end date) with a score of 9:
        *   1:48:18 pm
        *   1:47:33 pm
        *   1:47:28 pm
    *   This suggests the user submitted or saved their attempt very close to the exam's ending time, consistently achieving a score of 9.

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked ‚ÄúSave,‚Äù all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I‚Äôm not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

Hi [@23f2004781](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2004781)

I looked for your submissions in backend and can‚Äôt find any submission.

23f2004781:

> There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked ‚ÄúSave,‚Äù all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn‚Äôt join technical support meet before deadline.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a clear informational box from what appears to be a data science course forum, designed to guide students on where to seek help for different types of queries.

### Key Information:

*   **Purpose:** To direct students to appropriate channels for asking questions and resolving technical issues.
*   **Target Audience:** The resources are explicitly restricted to "IITM students only," suggesting this is a course offered by or for the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
*   **Support Channels:**
    *   **For General Questions:** Students are directed to "Join Discourse." Discourse is a popular open-source discussion platform often used for online communities and forums.
    *   **For Technical Issues:** Students have an "OPTIONAL" choice to "Join Google Meet." Google Meet is a video-communication service, implying a live, synchronous support option.
*   **Visual Cues:**
    *   The text is presented within a distinct box with a bright teal border on a dark background, making it stand out.
    *   A speech bubble icon with lines (representing text or chat) is next to the "Have questions?" line, visually reinforcing the idea of communication and querying.
    *   The phrases "Join Discourse" and "Join Google Meet" are underlined, indicating they are hyperlinks that students can click to access the respective platforms.

### Transcribed Text:

```
Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only).
Techical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only).
```

*Note: The word "Techical" appears as a typo in the original image, missing an 'n'. It has been transcribed exactly as it appears.**



Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can‚Äôt help with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don‚Äôt have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jayeshbansal)

Until not clicked on save button answers get‚Äôs checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don‚Äôt have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jayeshbansal)

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Hi [@23f3002537](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f3002537)  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Hello [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it‚Äôs 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the ‚Äúseconds‚Äù is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.

I didn‚Äôt submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

Respected Sir,

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term‚Äôs project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it‚Äôs my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I‚Äôm actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays metadata, likely from a user's activity log or a listing of forum interactions within a data science course platform.

**Key Information:**

*   **User Identity:** Both entries correspond to the same user, identified by the email address `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This suggests a student or participant ID within a Data Science (DS) program affiliated with IIT Madras (`iitm.ac.in`).
*   **Timestamps:** Two distinct timestamps are recorded, both on March 2, 2025:
    *   The first entry (top row) occurred at 17:51:08 (5:51:08 PM).
    *   The second entry (bottom row) occurred earlier, at 13:45:05 (1:45:05 PM).
*   **Associated Numerical Values:** Each timestamp is accompanied by a single digit number:
    *   The 17:51:08 entry has a value of `4`.
    *   The 13:45:05 entry has a value of `3`.
    *   Without further context, the exact meaning of these numbers is unclear, but in a forum setting, they could represent:
        *   Number of replies to a post.
        *   Number of views on a discussion.
        *   A sequential ID for an activity or submission.
        *   A score or rating for a specific interaction.
        *   Given the chronological order (earlier activity has '3', later activity has '4'), it's plausible these numbers are incrementing counts related to the user's engagement or content.

**Transcription:**

There is no code, commands, or error messages present in the image. The content is structured data:

*   **Entry 1:**
    *   `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   `2025-03-02 17:51:08`
    *   `4`
*   **Entry 2:**
    *   `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   `2025-03-02 13:45:05`
    *   `3`*



The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
