All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

Awaiting link  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays exam information for an IIT Madras course, specifically for exams scheduled on March 2nd, 2025. A table lists "COURSE NAME" (Python A1, Python A2, Java), "TIMING" (09:30 AM to 11:30 AM or 11:00 AM), and corresponding "EXAM LINK". The exam links follow the format: "https://exams.study.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_[course]_[number]". The links appear to be specific to each course and potentially different student groups (P1-P64, P65-P128). The page also highlights deadlines for applications related to the May 2025 batch.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a table outlining course names, timings, and exam links, dated March 2nd, 2025. For Python A1, Python A2, and Java, the 'Exam Link' column indicates "CLOSED." The TDS ROE exam link directs to "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe."  A note indicates that all timings are in IST, and Seeya is now integrated with Google Chrome and will only work in the updated version of Chrome. The table suggests that access to exams for the first three courses is unavailable.

Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000573)  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode  


> **Image:** The screenshot shows a "Recent saves" section, indicating a data science platform or notebook environment.  A "Reload" button is visible, likely intended to refresh the current state of the saved data.  The last saved time is displayed as "3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM". This suggests the user might be facing an issue related to data persistence or retrieving the most recent version of their work. The "Recent saves (most recent is your" text implies a mechanism to track different versions of the data.

Hello [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it‚Äôs showing 0 and dint get submitted properly‚Ä¶

As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a student's view of an online exam platform, specifically the "TDS 2025 Jan ROE" exam hosted at exam.sanand.workers.dev. The exam appears to be over, as indicated by "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST." The student's current score is 0, and the UI offers "Check all" and "Save" buttons. A "Bonus mark" section requests the student to fill out a form before 5 pm IST, which is specific to IITM students. It also shows recent saves with scores of 0 and 10 at different timestamps with "Reload" options.



Hoping for a positive response from your side sir.

Hello [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a user logged in as "22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" on a data science course platform. It displays "Recent saves" along with timestamps "3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM" and "3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM," both having a score of "8".  There is a "Reload" button associated with each saved instance. The text "(most recent is your official score)" indicates the importance of the most recent save. A "Logout" button is also visible.



I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.

Please consider accepting my submission

Thanks so much and best regards,

> **Image:** The screenshot shows the output of a Python script using the `tabula-py` library to extract tables from a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf". The script successfully loads required packages as indicated by "Requirement already satisfied" messages.  `tabula.backend` warnings indicate fallback fonts ("LiberationSans", "ZapfDingbats") were used during PDF processing, likely due to missing fonts.  The extracted data is displayed as a Pandas DataFrame, with columns "Maths", "Physics", "English", "Economics", "Biology", and "Group," with integer data types. The DataFrame's data type is flagged as 'object', likely reflecting the presence of mixed data types or potential issues during the extraction process.



```
!pip install tabula-py
import tabula
import pandas as pd
from google.colab import files

# Path to the PDF file
pdf_path = pdf_path = list(files.upload().keys())[0]

# Extract tables from the PDF, specifying pages and multiple_tables=True
tables = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_path, pages="all", multiple_tables=True)

# Initialize an empty list to store all DataFrames
all_dfs = []

# Iterate through each table and add a "Group" column based on the page number
for i, table in enumerate(tables):
    # Add a "Group" column to the table
    table["Group"] = i + 1  # Group 1 for Page 1, Group 2 for Page 2, etc.
    # Append the table to the list
    all_dfs.append(table)

# Combine all DataFrames into a single DataFrame
df = pd.concat(all_dfs, ignore_index=True)

# Rename columns for easier access (if necessary)
df.columns = ["Maths", "Physics", "English", "Economics", "Biology", "Group"]

# Convert marks to numerical data types
df["Maths"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Maths"], errors="coerce")
df["Physics"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Physics"], errors="coerce")
df["English"] = pd.to_numeric(df["English"], errors="coerce")
df["Economics"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Economics"], errors="coerce")
df["Biology"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Biology"], errors="coerce")
df["Group"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Group"], errors="coerce")

# Drop rows with missing values (if any)
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Display the first few rows of the combined DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Display the data types of the columns
print(df.dtypes)
filtered_df = df[(df["Biology"] >= 30) & (df["Group"].between(1, 28))]

total_biology_marks = filtered_df["Maths"].sum()
print(total_biology_marks)

```

Ignore the variables name, i got my value as 34919  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a user attempting to answer a question: "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 30 or more marks in Maths in groups 1-28 (including both groups)?" The user's input "34919" is displayed in a text input box, which is highlighted with a red outline and an error icon. Below the input, the message "Incorrect. Try again." indicates that the provided answer was not correct. The UI suggests a closed-answer question requiring a numerical response.

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today‚Äôs ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.

The issue is that the exam ended with a score of 0 when recent saves have a score of 10, this indicates there could be a problem with the score calculation or the way the final score is being saved/displayed.

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn‚Äôt click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA‚Äôs where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can‚Äôt do any help with this.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9‚Ä¶so I request to please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

Hi [@24f2003130](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24f2003130)

Your last submission before 1:47:00 was at 2025-03-02 13:42:34 with 8 marks, we will consider that.

Kind regards

The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks‚Ä¶I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use‚Ä¶so I guess that was helpful

Ok sir  
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28  
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.

Thank you

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked ‚ÄúSave,‚Äù all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I‚Äôm not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a technical issue during an online exam question regarding the Pearson correlation coefficient. The user is prompted to calculate the coefficient between columns A and B, rounding the result to three decimal places (example -0.769). After clicking "Check", a red error message appears stating "Error! Failed to fetch. Please contact the exam team for assistance." The UI shows elements such as the question input box (highlighted in red), "Check" and "Save" buttons, and the "Score: 1/10" indicator, suggesting this is part of a timed assessment. The error suggests a problem retrieving data or processing the answer server-side.

Hi [@23f2004781](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2004781)

I looked for your submissions in backend and can‚Äôt find any submission.

> There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked ‚ÄúSave,‚Äù all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn‚Äôt join technical support meet before deadline.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a UI element directing students to resources for help with questions and technical issues.  Specifically, students are advised to "Join Discourse (IITM students only)" for general questions.  For technical issues, they are given the "OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)" suggestion.  These options seem to be links based on the styling. This indicates a forum or course platform offering support specifically for IITM students.



Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can‚Äôt help with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don‚Äôt have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jayeshbansal)

Until not clicked on save button answers get‚Äôs checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don‚Äôt have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Hi [@23f3002537](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f3002537)  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Hello [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it‚Äôs 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the ‚Äúseconds‚Äù is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.

I didn‚Äôt submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term‚Äôs project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it‚Äôs my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I‚Äôm actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

> **Image:** The screenshot displays tabular data with the email "23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" repeated across two rows. Dates and timestamps "2025-03-02 17:51:08" and "2025-03-02 13:45:05" are listed in the center column for each entry.  The right-most column contains numerical values "4" and "3" for the two rows respectively. This data might be tracking user activity or submissions on a learning platform. Further context is required to determine the exact meaning of each column.



The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
