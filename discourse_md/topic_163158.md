Same issue with me sir.  
This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from an online learning platform, likely a Learning Management System (LMS), for an IIT Madras course titled "Jan 2025- TDS". The user is currently viewing the details for "Graded Assignment 1."

Here's the key information presented:

**1. Course and Navigation Context:**
*   **Institution:** IIT Madras
*   **Course Identifier:** Jan 2025- TDS (likely referring to the start semester and a course acronym, perhaps "Tools for Data Science" or "Techniques in Data Science" given the module names).
*   **Navigation:** The left sidebar shows "Modules" and "Grades". "Grades" is currently selected, indicating the user is in a section related to graded items.
*   **Course Structure (visible modules):**
    *   Course Introduction
    *   Module 1: Development Tools (currently expanded)
        *   Graded Assignment 1 (highlighted as the current view)
    *   Module 2: Deployment Tools (collapsed)

**2. Graded Assignment 1 Details:**
*   **Title:** Graded Assignment 1
*   **Due Date:**
    ```
    2025-01-26, 23:59 IST.
    ```
    *   This specifies the exact deadline, including the time zone (Indian Standard Time).
*   **Submission Policy:**
    *   "You may submit any number of times before the due date. The final submission will be considered for evaluation."
    *   This indicates that students have multiple attempts and only their last submission before the deadline counts.
*   **Access Troubleshooting Steps:**
    *   A list of common causes and solutions if a student faces difficulty accessing the assignment:
        1.  "Ad blockers need to be disabled/removed."
        2.  "The site requires cookies for authentication. So any cookie blocking/tracker blocking extension needs to be disabled."
        3.  "Javascript is required for the site to work correctly."
        4.  "Chrome Browser is the recommended software to access the contents."
        5.  "Disable any browser extensions that may be interfere with the site from working correctly." (Note: "be interfere" appears to be a minor grammatical error, but transcribed as is.)
        6.  "Overly aggressive anti-virus software may also cause similar access problems."
*   **Mandatory Student ID for Evaluation:**
    *   "You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment evaluation."
    *   This emphasizes the strict requirement to use the specific university-provided student ID format for the assignment submission or assessment process.
*   **Confirmation Question:**
    *   A question for the user to confirm their action related to the assignment:
        ```
        1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it.
        ```
    *   "this link" is hyperlinked, implying it leads to the actual assignment content.
    *   **Options:**
        *   Yes (radio button)
        *   No (radio button)

**3. Code/Commands/Error Messages (Exact Transcriptions):**
*   There are no explicit code blocks, commands, or direct error messages displayed in this screenshot. The troubleshooting steps describe *causes* of potential issues, not actual error messages from the system.
*   The only "code-like" element is the example student ID format provided: `22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`*

Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as well as on the course domain shared above.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read *everything carefully.*

Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a concise list of four key characteristics or points of information, likely related to a data science course. Each point is preceded by a right-pointing triangle icon, formatted as a simple bulleted list. The text is white on a dark grey background.

**Key Information:**

The content provides insights into the nature, difficulty, prerequisites, and learning methodology of a course. It suggests that the course is:
1.  **Practical and Relevant:** It focuses on exposing students to tools used in real-world scenarios.
2.  **Challenging:** It is explicitly stated to be difficult.
3.  **Requires Prior Knowledge:** Students are expected to have existing programming skills before starting.
4.  **Community-Oriented:** It promotes collaborative learning and knowledge sharing among participants.

**Transcription:**

*   ► This course exposes you to real-life tools
*   ► This course is quite hard
*   ► Programming skills are a pre-requisite
*   ► We encourage learning by sharing*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, providing important information and student feedback regarding the course's difficulty, prerequisites, and expectations.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course Difficulty:** The prominent heading "▼ This course is quite hard" (which is currently expanded and highlighted) sets the tone. Student feedback reinforces this, stating:
    *   The course "used to be an easy course until 2024," but "Now it's hard and covers more."
    *   It requires "extra time" and "takes more time than typical 3-credit courses."
    *   Students are advised to "Take it in your last semester if possible."

2.  **Grading and Specific Challenges:**
    *   "LLMs grade you – unpredictably." This indicates that Large Language Models are used for grading, and their unpredictable nature is a concern for students.
    *   "The ROE is hard." "ROE" is an acronym specific to this course content (e.g., "Return on Experiment," "Rate of Evolution," etc.), which students find difficult.

3.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   A "good understanding" is needed in several areas: "Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts."
    *   "Programming skills are a pre-requisite" (this section is collapsed).

4.  **Readiness Check and Recommendation:**
    *   Students are strongly advised to "**Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this course.**"
    *   If a student scores low on this assignment, they should "Please drop this course in a later term if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now."

5.  **General Course Philosophy:**
    *   The course "exposes you to real-life tools" (this section is collapsed).
    *   "We encourage learning by sharing" (this section is collapsed).

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no traditional code snippets, command-line instructions, or error messages present in the screenshot.
The hash symbols (`#`) appear multiple times, seemingly as placeholders for redacted or hidden information, or as a general design element within the forum's content. They are not part of any executable code, commands, or error outputs.

Here are the exact appearances of the hash symbols:

*   `# # #` (after "It used to be an easy course until 2024.")
*   `# # #` (after "Take it in your last semester if possible.")
*   `# # #` (after "It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.")
*   `# #` (after "LLMs grade you – unpredictably.")
*   `#` (after "The ROE is hard.")*



Kind regards

**Reactions:** 👍 1 ❤️ 1

I’m confused where exactly is the TDS course?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the "Graded Assignment 1" page within an online learning management system (LMS) for an "IIT Madras Jan 2025- TDS" course.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course and Navigation:**
    *   **Course Name:** IIT Madras Jan 2025- TDS
    *   **Left Sidebar Navigation:** Shows "Modules" expanded, specifically "Module 1: Development Tools" which contains "Graded Assignment 1". Other modules (Deployment Tools, Large Language Models) and sections (Project 1, Learning Feedback, Course Introduction, Grades) are listed but collapsed.
    *   The "Grades" section is currently highlighted, indicating the user is viewing a graded item.

2.  **Assignment Details:**
    *   **Assignment Title:** Graded Assignment 1
    *   **Due Date:** `2025-01-26, 23:59 IST`
    *   **Submission Policy:** "You may submit any number of times before the due date. The final submission will be considered for grading."

3.  **Access and Troubleshooting Instructions:**
    *   A section titled "If you have any difficulty accessing the Graded Assignment, please check the following causes:" lists six common issues:
        1.  Ad blockers need to be disabled/removed.
        2.  The site requires cookies for authentication. So any cookie blocking/tracker blocking extensions or software may prevent access.
        3.  Javascript is required for the site to work correctly.
        4.  Chrome Browser is the recommended software to access the contents.
        5.  Disable any browser extensions that may be interfere with the site from working correctly.
        6.  Overly aggressive anti-virus software may also cause similar access problems.

4.  **Critical Student ID Requirement:**
    *   A bolded instruction states: "You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation."

5.  **Assignment Question/Confirmation:**
    *   The page presents a single question worth "1 point":
        "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at **this link** and have attempted it."
    *   **Options:**
        *   Yes (radio button)
        *   No (radio button)

6.  **Submission Button:**
    *   A "Submit Answers" button is present at the bottom of the visible content area.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Transcribed Exactly):**

There are no explicit code blocks, commands to be executed in a console, or error messages displayed on this page. The most relevant transcribable text that could be considered "commands" or "instructions" are the troubleshooting steps and the student ID requirement:

*   **Due date for this assignment:** `2025-01-26, 23:59 IST.`
*   **Submission Policy:** `You may submit any number of times before the due date. The final submission will be considered for grading.`
*   **Troubleshooting causes (verbatim list):**
    1.  `Ad blockers need to be disabled/removed.`
    2.  `The site requires cookies for authentication. So any cookie blocking/tracker blocking extensions or software may prevent access.`
    3.  `Javascript is required for the site to work correctly.`
    4.  `Chrome Browser is the recommended software to access the contents.`
    5.  `Disable any browser extensions that may be interfere with the site from working correctly.`
    6.  `Overly aggressive anti-virus software may also cause similar access problems.`
*   **Crucial Instruction:** `You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.`
*   **Assignment Question:** `1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it.`*



  
Where are the weekly videos?  
Where and what is the assignment?  
I’m confused.
