Same issue with me sir.  
This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a "Graded Assignment 1" page within a data science course. It lists potential causes for access issues, including ad blockers, cookie restrictions, and disabled JavaScript. It recommends using the Chrome browser and disabling browser extensions. Students are instructed to use their student ID (e.g., "22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") for evaluation purposes. A question asks whether the student has seen the assignment at a provided link, with "Yes" and "No" radio buttons for selection.

The course content is available at



> **Image:** The screenshot displays the "Course Introduction" page within a data science course forum, specifically "Jan 2025-TDS" from IIT Madras.  The UI shows navigation options for "Modules" and "Grades", with the currently selected "Course Introduction" module highlighted.  Text indicates "The entire course will be available at this link: TDS 2025 Jan Term", suggesting this is a relevant resource. The course has a 5/5 rating from 1 review, and a "Submit a review" link is visible.



At [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) the course calendar is also available.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a course navigation and links for a "Tools in Data Science" course. A sidebar allows navigation through course topics like "Tools in Data Science", "Development Tools", "Data Analysis", and "Data Visualization".  The main content area contains "Course Links" including links to the "TDS Discourse" and "IITM BS Degree Programme".  Below that are "Jan 2025 Links" pointing to resources like "TDS: Course page - Jan 2025", "TDS: Course calendar - Jan 2025" and "TDS: Course material – Jupyter notebooks, datasets, etc."  There are no visible code snippets, error messages, or data visualizations.



Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as well as on the course domain shared above.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read *everything carefully.*

Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…



> **Image:** The screenshot displays general information about the course. Specifically, the text states "This course exposes you to real-life tools" and "This course is quite hard". Another important point mentioned is that "Programming skills are a pre-requisite". Finally, the course promotes collaborative learning by saying "We encourage learning by sharing".





> **Image:** The screenshot displays information about a data science course. The main concern is course difficulty, indicated by the expanded dropdown menu labelled "This course is quite hard".  Students' feedback highlights that the course has become significantly more challenging, particularly after 2024. Several points end with "###" or "# #", suggesting missing or redacted content, potentially student names or specific project identifiers. Students are advised to "Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this course", implying a way to assess preparedness.



Kind regards

I’m confused where exactly is the TDS course?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a "Graded Assignment 1" page on a learning platform with a due date of "2025-01-26, 23:59 IST." It lists potential reasons for access difficulties, including disabled cookies, ad blockers, browser extensions, and overly aggressive anti-virus software.  The text emphasizes the necessity of using the correct student ID for the assignment ("You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment").  A single, multiple-choice question is present, asking if the assignment has been seen and attempted with "Yes" and "No" options, with a "Submit Answers" button below it. The assignment is worth one point.



  
Where are the weekly videos?  
Where and what is the assignment?  
I’m confused.
