I am too sleepy to work on it now… So seriously… PRs are not only appreciated but needed. Just add the basic parsing code or image manipulation for ga5. I will try and add in the morning but who doesn’t like Good PRs? Also mentioning [@23f2005325](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2005325) (Aishik) here for his wonderful PR which I have now merged.

It shows a branched and merged history, originating from "main", with recent activity like "Merge pull request #2 from de...", "Added chardet code to get file encoding", "Rename README.txt.txt to README_LLM.tx...". Other commits include "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.co...", "Merge pull request #1 from painful-bug/...". The UI elements emphasize the sequence of commits, branching points, and merge events.

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
