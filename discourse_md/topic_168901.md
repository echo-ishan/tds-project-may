I am too sleepy to work on it now… So seriously… PRs are not only appreciated but needed. Just add the basic parsing code or image manipulation for ga5. I will try and add in the morning but who doesn’t like Good PRs? Also mentioning [@23f2005325](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2005325) (Aishik) here for his wonderful PR which I have now merged.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Git repository's commit history and branching structure, likely within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a specialized Git client. It's a visual representation of source control activity.

### Key Information:

1.  **Context**: The interface is a "SOURCE CONTROL GRAPH" or similar Git visualization tool, indicated by the partial title "SOURCE CONTROL GR..." at the top left. This is a common feature in IDEs like VS Code, showing the commit log.
2.  **Current Branch**: The repository is currently on the `main` branch, indicated by the blue `@main` tag prominently displayed next to the most recent commit.
3.  **Recent Activity (Commits & Merges)**:
    *   **Pull Request Merges**: Multiple pull requests (`#2`, `#3`, `#1`) have been merged into the `main` branch, suggesting a collaborative development workflow.
    *   **Feature Branches**: Distinct colored lines (yellow, pink, teal) represent different development branches that were created, worked on, and subsequently merged back into the `main` branch (blue line).
    *   **Specific Features/Changes**: Commit messages indicate various tasks completed:
        *   Adding `chardet` for file encoding detection.
        *   Renaming a `README` file, specifically to `README_LLM.txt`, suggesting a focus on Large Language Models (LLM).
        *   Work on "llm code week-3".
        *   Adding a link to `base64guru` website.
        *   Adding a Nominatim API sample.
        *   Adding files for "mock1 data extraction".
        *   Adding an "extractions notebook".
4.  **Collaboration/Authorship**: The presence of different names/identifiers (e.g., `Aishik Bandyopadhyay`, `ritwiktrivedi`, `painful-bug/`, `23f2000573`) associated with commits indicates multiple contributors or distinct branches.
5.  **Git Operations**: The icons at the top right suggest common Git operations like auto-fetching/syncing, refreshing, and potentially pushing/pulling changes to/from a remote repository (indicated by the cloud icon).

*   **Top Bar Elements:**
    *   `Auto`
    *   `@main` (blue bubble with target icon)

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
