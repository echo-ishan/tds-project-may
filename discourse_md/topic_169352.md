> **Image:** The screenshot is from an online quiz/exam interface titled "TDS 2025 Jan ROE". The UI shows instructions that include advice like "Save regularly" and "Browser may struggle".  Two save entries are listed under "Recent saves" from 3/2/2025 with scores of 8 each, and the "Reload" button next to each.  The user's score is currently "Score: 0" at the top. IITM students can join Discourse or Google Meet for questions.

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.  
If not then, you will be marked absent.
