> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online examination or quiz interface for a data science course, likely from IIT Madras, given the domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. The specific assessment is titled "TDS 2025 Jan ROE".

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Assessment Details:**
*   **Title:** TDS 2025 Jan ROE
*   **Status:** "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST"
*   **Displayed Score:** "Score: 0"
*   **Current Date/Time (System):** 07-03-2025, 07:25 PM IST (This means the screenshot was taken on March 7, 2025, after the exam officially ended on March 2, 2025).
*   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`

**2. Instructions:**
The assessment has a detailed set of instructions:
1.  **Learn what you need.** Reading material is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the question. (Or learn it, just for pleasure.)
2.  **Check answers regularly** by pressing `Check`. It shows which answers are right or wrong. You can check multiple times.
3.  **Save regularly** by pressing `Save`. You can save multiple times. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.
4.  **Reloading is OK.** Your answers are saved in your browser (not server). Questions won't change except for randomized parameters.
5.  **Browser may struggle.** If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.
6.  **Use anything.** You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.
7.  **It's hackable.** It's possible to get the answer to *some* questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.

**3. Bonus Mark Information:**
*   "Please fill out this form before 5 pm IST to get a bonus mark. Details of the bonus are in the form description. (This is for IITM students only.)" (The text "this form" is a clickable link).

**4. Support & Communication:**
*   **Questions:** "Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)" (The word "Discourse" is a clickable link).
*   **Technical Issues:** "Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)" (The text "Google Meet" is a clickable link).

**5. User Information:**
*   **Logged In As:** `22f3000099@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   A "Logout" button is available.

**6. Recent Saves:**
This section shows the user's past attempts and scores, noting "most recent is your official score":
*   `Reload` from 3/2/2025, 3:09:29 PM. Score: 8
*   `Reload` from 3/2/2025, 2:57:31 PM. Score: 8
*   *Note:* There's a discrepancy between the "Score: 0" displayed at the top of the page and the "Score: 8" shown in the "Recent saves" section for saves made on the exam end date. The instruction "most recent is your official score" would imply the score 8 should be the official one.

**7. Browser & System Context:**
*   **Browser:** Google Chrome (visible in tabs and taskbar).
*   **Open Tabs:** Other tabs include "My Dashboard - IIT Madras Onl", "Course Introduction :: IITM Onl", "[TDS Jan 25] Important ROE Info", "Latest topics - IITM-DSA", and "History".
*   **Operating System:** Windows (taskbar visible).
*   **System Status:** "Air: Moderate Now" (Air quality information).

**No specific code, commands, or error messages** are present in the traditional sense (e.g., from a terminal or programming environment), other than the literal text of the instructions and button labels mentioned above.*

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.  
If not then, you will be marked absent.
