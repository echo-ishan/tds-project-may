> **Image:** This screenshot appears to be an introductory visual for a data science course module, likely a video or presentation. The text on the screen reads "Week 4 Session 4," indicating the fourth session of the fourth week. The surrounding graphics include abstract representations of data visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and network graphs, potentially hinting at topics covered in the session. There are also depictions of tools and resources. No specific code, errors, or interactive UI elements are visible.
