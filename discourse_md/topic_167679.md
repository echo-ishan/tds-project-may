The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website ([s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net)) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?  
Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the students…



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the provided screenshot:

The screenshot details the grading scheme for a "Tools in Data Science" course.  It outlines assessment components like "Remote Online Exam 1" (ROE1), "take home project 1" (P1), and "take home project 2" (P2) along with their open, submission, and peer review dates in a table. Key equations for the final course score 'T' are given: "Final course score T = 0.1GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.3F" and "Final course score T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.25F", where GAA represents the score in best 4 of 7 weekly assignments and F is the final exam score. Eligibility criteria for attending the end-term exam is also defined as an average of at least 40/100. There are some date inconsistencies for submission/peer review dates of the projects.
