> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an online assessment or quiz from an IIT Madras data science course, specifically "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation". The interface indicates the assessment has concluded.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Course & Assignment:**
    *   **Course Title (from tab and main heading):** TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation
    *   **URL:** `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5`
    *   **Institution:** IIT Madras (indicated by browser tabs: "My Dashboard - IIT Madras", "Course Introduction :: IITM O", and the user's email domain).

2.  **Assessment Status:**
    *   **End Date & Time:** The assessment "Ended at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".
    *   **Current Displayed Score:** "Score: 0" is shown in the top red banner. However, the "Recent saves" section indicates previous attempts with scores.

3.  **Instructions for the Assessment:**
    *   **Learning-Oriented:** Reading material is provided, but users can skip if they know the answer.
    *   **Iterative Checking:** Users can `Check` answers multiple times to see what's right or wrong.
    *   **Saving Progress:** Users should `Save` regularly. Only the last saved submission will be evaluated. Answers are saved locally in the browser, not on the server.
    *   **Reloading:** Reloading the page is acceptable; questions will not change except for "randomized parameters".
    *   **Technical Advice:** If browser issues occur, users should try disabling security restrictions or using a different browser.
    *   **Open Resources:** Users are allowed to use "any resources," including "The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks." This suggests an open-book, problem-solving approach.
    *   **"Hackable" Nature:** Unusually, it states, "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed." This implies an advanced learning component encouraging code inspection.

4.  **User Information:**
    *   **Logged In User:** The user is logged in as `23f3004238@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.`.
    *   A "Logout" button is available.

5.  **Discussion Forum:**
    *   A link is provided to "Join the discussion on Discourse" for questions.

6.  **Recent Saves & Score History:**
    *   The section "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" shows previous attempts and scores:
        *   From 21/02/2025, 23:18:35. Score: 9
        *   From 21/02/2025, 23:15:07. Score: 9
        *   From 21/02/2025, 23:03:00. Score: 8
    *   This indicates the student achieved a score of 9 on their most recent save, despite the banner showing "Score: 0" (which might be a placeholder or indicative of no active evaluation after the deadline).

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Commands (as mentioned in instructions or buttons):**
    *   `Check`
    *   `Save`
    *   `Reload` (from recent saves)
*   **No explicit error messages or code blocks are visible in the screenshot.** The term "hacking the code" is mentioned as an allowed action for learning.*



Is this something to worry about?

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.

Kind regards
