> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The image shows a data preparation quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation" from an IIT Madras course.  The quiz instructions emphasize regular saving ("Save") and answer checking ("Check"). It also notes the quiz is "hackable."  The user's email is displayed ("23f3004238@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"), and a "Recent saves" section lists previous attempts with timestamps and scores (e.g., "from 21/02/2025, 23:18:35. Score: 9"). The quiz deadline is "Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and the current score is "Score: 0", with options to "Check all" and "Save".



Is this something to worry about?

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.

Kind regards
