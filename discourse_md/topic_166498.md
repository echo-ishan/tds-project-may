# Topic: Chat GPT new release

Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures an interaction in a data science development environment, likely involving a Python API project and a ChatGPT assistant for debugging.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Development Environment & Interaction:**
*   The interface shows a split view: a chat panel (ChatGPT 4o) on the left and a code editor/console on the right.
*   This suggests an integrated development environment where users can write code, run it, and get assistance from an AI.

**2. ChatGPT Interaction (Left Panel):**
*   **User's Problem (implied by ChatGPT's response):** The user was facing a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'`. This error typically indicates an issue with Python's SSL module, often related to underlying OpenSSL libraries or environment configurations, preventing secure communication.
*   **ChatGPT's Proposed Solution:**
    *   ChatGPT "updated the code to handle environments without SSL by including a workaround for SSL configuration using `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable."
    *   It explicitly states: "This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue."
*   **Current State:** ChatGPT is asking for feedback ("Let me know if you encounter further issues or need additional adjustments!").

**3. Python Code (`Wiki Outline Api` - Top Right Panel):**
*   **Purpose:** The code's docstring indicates its purpose: `"Fetch the Wikipedia page of a country and generate a Markdown outline."`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It constructs a Wikipedia URL based on a `country` input (replacing spaces with underscores).
    *   It uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the Wikipedia page.
    *   It includes error handling for HTTP status codes (returning a JSON error if the page can't be fetched, e.g., 404).
    *   It uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.
    *   It then extracts headings (H1 to H6) from the parsed HTML.
*   **Visible Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    """Fetch the Wikipedia page of a country and generate a Markdown outline."""
    try:

        # Format the Wikipedia URL
        wiki_url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{country.replace(' ', '_')}"

        # Fetch the Wikipedia page
        response = requests.get(wiki_url)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            return JSONResponse(
                content={"error": "Unable to fetch Wikipedia page for the specified country."},
                status_code=404,
            )

        # Parse the HTML content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

        # Extract headings (H1 to H6)
        headings = []
        for i in range(1, 7):
            for heading in soup.find_all(f"h{i}"):
                text = heading.get_text() string()
    ```
    *Note: `string()` after `get_text()` appears to be a typo or partial code; `strip()` is more common for cleaning text from Beautiful Soup elements.*

**4. Console Output (Bottom Right Panel):**
*   The console displays several `File` paths and `import` statements, which are typically found in a Python traceback. These paths point to modules like `starlette.datastructures`, `starlette.concurrency`, and `anyio`. This suggests the project is likely using a web framework like Starlette or FastAPI (which uses Starlette) and `anyio` for asynchronous operations.
*   Crucially, the actual `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` error message is *not* visible in the console, but it is explicitly mentioned by ChatGPT. This implies that the user previously ran the code, encountered that error, then asked ChatGPT for help, and *after* applying ChatGPT's suggestions, the code was run again.
*   **Resolution Indication:** The final line in the console is "Run successfully", which confirms that the `ssl` module issue (or at least the execution blocking it) has been resolved.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

**ChatGPT Message (Error Identified & Solution):**
```
Edited
I've updated the code to handle environments
without SSL by including a workaround for SSL
configuration using certifi and checking
the PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY environment
variable. This should resolve the
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'ssl' issue.
```

**Python Code (from `Wiki Outline Api`):**
```python
"""Fetch the Wikipedia page of a country and generate a Markdown outline."""
try:

    # Format the Wikipedia URL
    wiki_url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{country.replace(' ', '_')}"

    # Fetch the Wikipedia page
    response = requests.get(wiki_url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return JSONResponse(
            content={"error": "Unable to fetch Wikipedia page for the specified country."},
            status_code=404,
        )

    # Parse the HTML content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

    # Extract headings (H1 to H6)
    headings = []
    for i in range(1, 7):
        for heading in soup.find_all(f"h{i}"):
            text = heading.get_text() string()
```

**Console Output:**
```
from starlette.datastructures import UploadFile
File "/lib/python3.12/site-packages/starlette/datastructures.py", line 7, in <module>
from starlette.concurrency import run_in_threadpool
File "/lib/python3.12/site-packages/starlette/concurrency.py", line 8, in <module>
import anyio.to_thread

from ._core._sockets import connect_tcp as connect_tcp
File "/lib/python3.12/site-packages/anyio/_core/_sockets.py", line 6, in <module>

Run successfully
