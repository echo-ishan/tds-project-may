Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a Python script for fetching and outlining Wikipedia pages, along with a console output and a chatbot interface.  The code uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to retrieve and parse HTML content. A "Run" button suggests an interactive coding environment. The console shows a traceback originating from `starlette` and `anyio` libraries, ultimately caused by `ImportError: No module named 'ssl'`. This indicates an issue with SSL library availability or configuration. The chat interface displays messages mentioning an attempt to handle SSL issues using `certifi` and the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable.
