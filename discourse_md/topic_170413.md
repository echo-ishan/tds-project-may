Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) ,

Will this session be recorded and shared later?  
It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.

[

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a single participant's video feed during an online meeting.

**Key Information:**

*   **Platform:** The meeting is taking place on **Google Meet**, indicated by the logo and text "Google Meet" in the top right corner.
*   **Participant Identity:** The person visible in the video feed is identified as **Anand S**, whose name is displayed in the bottom left corner.
*   **Participant Appearance:** Anand S is an adult male with graying hair, wearing a light-colored collared shirt. He is wearing a headset or earpiece with a visible microphone boom positioned near his chin, suggesting he is actively participating in the audio of the call.
*   **Background:** The background is a plain, light-colored (likely white or off-white) wall. An electrical outlet with a black cable plugged into it is visible on the wall to the left of Anand S. There are very faint, blurry patterns on the wall to the right, possibly from light or a subtle wallpaper design.
*   **Contextual Inference:** Given that this screenshot is from a "data science course forum," it most likely depicts a live online lecture, discussion, or Q&A session for a data science course, with Anand S being a student or an instructor/TA.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code, commands, or error messages visible in this screenshot. The image focuses solely on a participant's video feed during the online meeting.*
