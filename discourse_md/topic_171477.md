Good Morning Sir,

This is my github repo: [GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS\_Project\_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)

I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton),

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum (specifically, an email notification), here's a detailed breakdown:

This is an email sent to a student from a course named "TDS" (likely "The Data Science" or "Topics in Data Science") regarding their "Project 1 Docker Image Submission Scores." The email was sent on **Mar 29, 2025, at 12:21 AM**.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose of the Email:** To inform the student about the evaluation results of their Project 1 Docker image submission and provide resources for understanding their score.

2.  **Likely Outcome for the Student:** The student's submission appears to have issues, as indicated by the bolded "**MISSING**" status. This means either the required files were not available, the evaluation process could not run, or the Docker image itself was misconfigured. Crucially, the email states, "**MISSING files will result in a score of 0.**"

3.  **Docker Image Requirements and Evaluation Environment:**
    *   **Responsiveness:** The Docker image was expected to become responsive within 5 minutes of launch. Failure to do so would result in the submission not being considered.
    *   **Compute Environment:** Evaluations were performed on an **8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit**.
    *   **Network Bandwidth:** Each Docker image was allocated **1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth**, which is highlighted as "nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet," implying network performance should not be a bottleneck.

4.  **Provided Resources for Review and Debugging:** The email directs the student to a list of files to help them understand the evaluation and debug any issues:
    *   **Evaluation Log File:** Contains the performance report on individual tasks.
    *   **Docker Log File:** Provides technical performance details of the container.
    *   **Server Start Log File:** Relevant if the Docker service failed to start or respond (provided as an attachment, with separate logs for ARM and x86 architectures).
    *   **Evaluation Script File:** The actual tests run against the submission and the scoring mechanism (provided as an attachment, with separate logs for ARM and x86 architectures).
    *   **Data Generation File:** Used by the evaluation file to create task data (provided as an attachment).
    *   **Docker Orchestration File:** Handles retrieving the Docker image from Docker Hub, launching the container, setting environment variables, and managing port mappings (provided as an attachment).
    *   **Solution Script:** A sample solution to Project 1, created using "prompt engineering only," showcasing desired results (provided as a zip attachment).

5.  **Evaluated Docker Image ID:** The specific Docker image that was evaluated is identified.

6.  **Score Finalization and Appeal Process:**
    *   The current scores are provisional and reflect the current evaluation standards.
    *   Students can report bugs in the evaluation scripts or discrepancies.
    *   There is a clear deadline: **"You will have until Tuesday to report any problems."** After this, scores will be considered final, and a final marking schema will be released.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

*   **Error/Status Message:**
    ```
    MISSING
    ```
*   **Google Drive URLs (Links to logs):**
    *   Evaluation log file:
        `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h0HJ-yKj5t1ud42_b8mktmuF7bMLzsvs/view?usp=drivesdk`

    *   GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile`.
    *   Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a specific `podman` command.
    *   Docker image uses the same `Dockerfile` as in the GitHub repository.
3.  **Consequence of Failure:** The email explicitly states: "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."
4.  **Student's Evaluation Results:**
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: **PASS**"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: **FAIL**"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: **FAIL**" (Note: "Dockerfile" is highlighted as if selected text).
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: **FAIL**"
5.  **Overall Outcome:**
    *   "Prerequisites: **FAIL**"
    *   "Project 1 Score: **0**"

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages (transcribed exactly):**

The email contains a `podman run` command as part of the fourth prerequisite:

```
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
```*



My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the successful build and execution of a Docker container for a Python-based web application.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Process:**
The user is interacting with Docker to first build an image and then run a container from that image. The application inside the container starts successfully. There are no error messages displayed.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Docker Image Build Steps:**
    The top section shows the Docker image build process, indicating the steps performed as defined in a `Dockerfile`.
    *   It sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   It copies files from the current directory on the host to `/app` in the container.
    *   It copies `requirements.txt` into `/app`.
    *   It installs Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

2.  **Docker Image Export and Naming:**
    After the build steps, Docker exports the image layers and manifests. It then names the image locally with its SHA256 digest.

3.  **Docker Build Details Link:**
    A link is provided to view more detailed build information in Docker Desktop.

4.  **Docker Container Execution:**
    The user then executes a `docker run` command to start a container from the newly built image.

5.  **Application Startup:**
    Inside the container, a server process starts. Based on the "Uvicorn running" message, this is a Python web application, likely built with a framework like FastAPI or Starlette, using Uvicorn as the ASGI server. The application is listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

**Docker Build Steps (from Dockerfile):**
```
=> [2/5] WORKDIR /app
=> [3/5] COPY . .
=> [4/5] COPY requirements.txt /app/
=> [5/5] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

**Docker Build Details Link:**
```
View build details: docker-desktop://dashboard/build/desktop-linux/desktop-linux/4btzhep5n0ttsar3bibf4z96c
```

**Docker Run Command:**
```
C:\SSNFun\IITM\sudhishssn134-project_1_tds-b240fec>docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49
```
*   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Passes an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` with its current shell value to the container.
*   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 from the container to port 8000 on the host machine.
*   `sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49`: The image digest (ID) of the Docker image to be run.

**Application Startup Messages:**
```
INFO: Started server process [1]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Error Messages:**
There are **no error messages** visible in this screenshot. All operations appear to have completed successfully.*



Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,

```
uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

As I dont have evaluate.py

But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir

*April 29, 2025, 14:34 UTC*
Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot details the successful build and execution of a Docker image, likely containing a Python web application, from a command-line interface.

### Key Information:

1.  **Docker Image Build Process:**
    *   The top section shows the steps involved in building a Docker image. This includes pulling base layers (indicated by `sha256:` hashes and sizes), extracting them, transferring build context (local files), and then executing Dockerfile instructions.
    *   The Dockerfile instructions executed are:
        *   Setting the working directory to `/app` inside the container.
        *   Copying files from the host to the `/app` directory in the container.
        *   Specifically copying `requirements.txt` to `/app`.
        *   Installing Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install --no-cache-dir`.
    *   The build concludes with exporting the image, layers, manifests, and naming it to a `sha256` digest, indicating a successful image creation.

2.  **Docker Run Command:**
    *   The bottom section shows a `docker run` command being executed, which starts a container from the newly built image.
    *   It passes an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the container, suggesting potential API authentication or interaction with an AI proxy service.
    *   It maps port `8000` from the host machine to port `8000` inside the container, indicating that the application runs on this port.

3.  **Application Startup:**
    *   After the `docker run` command, the output shows `INFO` messages from the application itself.
    *   It indicates that a server process has started, waited for startup, completed startup, and finally, `Uvicorn` is reported to be running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. This confirms the successful launch of a Python web server within the container.

4.  **Context:**
    *   The presence of `requirements.txt` and `pip install` suggests a Python application.
    *   `Uvicorn` is a popular ASGI web server commonly used with frameworks like FastAPI or Starlette, frequently employed in data science for deploying machine learning models as APIs.
    *   The `AIPROXY_TOKEN` hints at integration with external AI services or a specific deployment infrastructure related to AI/ML.

Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,

```
uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

As I dont have evaluate.py

But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir

[URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/urgent-attn-req-technical-discrepancy-and-inconsistency-in-the-evaluation-scripts-of-graded-assignment-and-project-2/173172/32) [Tools in Data Science](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds/blob/main/Dockerfile)) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation.
> Project 2 : Response we received through google form was <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api> which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
