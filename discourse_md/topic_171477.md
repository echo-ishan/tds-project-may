Mail I received Yesterday:  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the results of prerequisite checks for "Project 1". The checks assess the state of a GitHub repository and its associated Docker image. The evaluations show that the Docker image exists and is public, but the GitHub repository itself, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license are missing or not properly placed in the repository's root. A Docker execution command is provided: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The user needs to fix the GitHub repo to pass these requirements.



Previous Correct Evaluation Mail:  



> **Image:** The screenshot is from a data science course forum addressing a Docker image submission. The submission received a score of 0 because "MISSING" files suggest the evaluation did not run or the Docker image was misconfigured. The email provides links to "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file" via Google Drive: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BaAw9x6g2YBRDgf-GoZSe1UbGSSBafnO/view?usp=drivesdk` and `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aFya6jG3YF1UrahQu7qnCbEOaDh4JW27/view?usp=drivesdk` respectively, and indicates that other files like "Server start log file" are attachments. The email also states that the Docker image ID evaluated was `48299f48f66b`.



Good Morning Sir,

This is my github repo: [GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS\_Project\_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)

I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Apologies for that,

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

Kind regards

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton),

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:



> **Image:** The screenshot is an email notification concerning a Docker image submission for "TDS Jan 25 Project 1." The email states "MISSING indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured," suggesting a potential problem with the submission's execution. Several files are listed, including "Evaluation log file," "Docker log file" with Google Drive links, and "Server start log file" specified as an attachment. The email also mentions the Docker image ID "b0d89eee9b17" and informs the recipient that the score is preliminary and subject to feedback. A key detail is that missing files result in a score of 0.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot is an email detailing the results of prerequisite checks for a data science project. The email states that the project requires passing checks related to a GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and Docker image. The evaluation shows that while the Docker image exists and is public, the Github repo is either not present, not public, or lacks a Dockerfile and MIT license in the root directory. The overall prerequisites evaluation is "FAIL" and the project score is 0, meaning the submission will not be evaluated further. The `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` command is provided as an example for running the Docker image.



My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?

My GitHub repository for Project-1: [GitHub - sudhishssn134/project\_1\_tds](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds)

Thanking You

Just attaching the mail I recieved.  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays an email related to the evaluation of a Docker image submission for a project. The email indicates that "MISSING" files result in a score of 0, potentially due to evaluation failures or misconfiguration.  It provides links to the evaluation log file (`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNtZ6bGYNUCudn4A0ZtRE-NqaQIRDPQK/view?usp=drivesdk`) and the docker log file (`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5KRIS2dpMNMpR1iLU0-WGnLRT-6yazq/view?usp=drivesdk`), both pointing to Google Drive.  Attachments include server start, evaluation script, data generation, Docker orchestration, and solution script files. The docker image ID evaluated is '7382b3277180'.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays the output of a Docker build process and subsequent container run.  The build steps include copying files, installing requirements with `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`, and exporting layers.  A `docker run` command is executed, passing an environment variable and port mapping: `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49`. Finally, the application starts successfully, indicated by "Application startup complete." and "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000".



Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,

```
uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

As I dont have evaluate.py

But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir
