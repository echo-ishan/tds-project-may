Please post any questions related to [Graded Assignment 4 - Data Sourcing](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4).

Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code (rather than screenshots). It’s easier for us to copy-paste and test.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a user's attempt to define JSON data representing a movie. The JSON structure includes "id", "title", "year", and "rating" fields. An error message is displayed: "Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9", indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual value for the "rating" field despite them appearing identical. The question "What is the JSON data?" implies a learning exercise where the user is likely being assessed on their JSON parsing or formatting skills. The issue suggests a possible data type mismatch or a hidden character causing the failure.

The new error message will be clearer, like this:

```
Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4

```

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?

edit: This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

There is no submit button is available in below screen. Is it fine to save the link url only. Please clarify (unless we click submit button the log of Graded Assignment 4 remains red)  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a "Graded Assignment 4" page within an IIT Madras online course.  It states the due date is "2025-02-09, 23:59 IST" and provides troubleshooting steps for access issues, including disabling ad blockers, allowing cookies, and ensuring JavaScript is enabled. The page emphasizes the need to use the correct Student ID (e.g., "22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") for the assignment. A link to the assignment is provided: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4".

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?

For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a search interface with applied filters, resulting in no results. The filter "Title name" is set to "Un matrimonio di troppo." The UI displays the message "No results found" along with a corresponding graphic of a magnifying glass crossed out.  The user is prompted to adjust their filters or start a new search. There are no visible code snippets or data visualizations beyond the basic UI elements.

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

[@JoelJeffrey](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)  
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

HOW TO GET BBC API KEY  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science question about retrieving and transforming weather data for Tel Aviv using the BBC Weather API. The instructions involve extracting `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription` to create a JSON object. The expected output format is shown as `{"2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds", ...}`.  The user is prompted to provide the JSON weather forecast description, but the answer box is empty and has an error message: "SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input", suggesting the user is submitting an incomplete JSON object.

Please find below the screen shot showing the committed with step name my iitm email id  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a GitHub Actions workflow file configuration. The file, named `daily-commit.yml`, is located at `.github/workflows/`.  The workflow is configured to run daily at 10:00 AM UTC using a cron schedule: `'0 10 * * *'`.  It consists of a job named `daily-commit` that runs on `ubuntu-latest`, and includes steps using `actions/checkout@v3` with `persist-credentials: false`. UI elements show the workflow is successfully completed ("daily-commit" with a green checkmark) and provides options to "Re-run all jobs".



  
But the answer says

Upon submission using the "Check" button, an error message appears stating: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@dsstudy.itm.ac.in". This implies that the system is unable to find a matching job execution associated with the provided GitHub repository based on the provided email or ID.

As per instruction we need to create a directory in that we should have .yml file. But I tried with there were two issues (1) Github has not allowed to run the file (as there was no menu is available to run manually) (I checked with Copolit AI it says it is not correct to have cron jobs in a directory, I am not sure) (2) when I submit the url to iitm I got the following error  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a YAML parsing error when attempting to use a GitHub repository URL. The error message "YAMLParseError: Implicit keys need to be on a single line at line 1, column 1: <!DOCTYPE html>" indicates a problem with the format of a YAML file related to the repository workflow. The user input "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows" in a red-highlighted input field likely caused the error.  The error suggests that an HTML document may be being parsed instead of a valid YAML file. The problem might be that the user is pasting the link to the github's page, and the page itself is trying to be parsed as YAML.



  
I removed the directory and submitted the same url I got the following error  



> **Image:** The user is attempting to validate a GitHub repository URL within a data science platform, as indicated by the prompt "Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO):". The entered URL is "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows". The system returns an error message: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," suggesting the platform is unable to find corresponding job execution data for the provided repository associated with a specific user ID within the domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

In the last two question of the ga,it is mentioned including both groups.so what is the meaning of this .  



> **Image:** The screenshot outlines a data analysis task involving student marks from a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf". The task requires extracting data from the PDF using libraries like Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2, cleaning it by converting marks to numerical types, filtering students based on marks between 17 and 66 in Physics, and finally, calculating the total Biology marks of the filtered students who scored 17 or higher in Physics. The final question asks: "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more marks in Physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups)?" The instructions highlight the use of data analysis to identify performance trends and enhance reporting efficiency.

Hi Tushar,

If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

Hi, even i’m facing the same issue,  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays the GitHub Actions UI for a "Daily Commit" workflow. It shows the "Summary" page for run #10. The workflow was manually triggered 16 hours ago by the user "DigvijaysinhChudasamallTM" on commit "e9aef97" of the "main" branch.  The workflow status is "Success," with a total duration of 18 seconds. The workflow file "daily-commit.yml" was triggered by "workflow_dispatch," and the "daily-commit" job took 7 seconds.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays the content of a YAML file named `daily-commit.yml` in a GitHub repository `TDS_GA_4`. The file defines a GitHub Actions workflow for creating a daily commit. The workflow is triggered by a cron schedule at 00:00 UTC and allows manual triggers via `workflow_dispatch`.  The workflow consists of steps to checkout the repository, set up Git configuration with user email and name, create a file named "daily-commit.txt" with a predefined message, and finally commit the changes. The UI shows the file path within the repository: `TDS_GA_4/.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows an error message in a data science course forum, indicating a problem with a GitHub workflow. The user has entered the repository URL "https://github.com/DigvijaysinhChudasamalIITM/TDS_GA_4" in a text field, which is highlighted in red to signal an error.  The error message displayed is "Error: No executed job step matches 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This suggests the workflow is failing because no job step produces the expected output associated with the provided email. The user is advised to trigger the workflow, ensure it's the most recent action, and verify it creates a commit within 5 minutes.

Issue resolved for me after following below step  
After creating the workflow:

* Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
* Ensure it appears as the **most recent action** in your repository
* Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run

Is there any way to crack this , I tired multiple time no improvement.  
Also what does this " It is *very hard* to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison." mean.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science course forum exercise about converting a PDF to Markdown. The task requires extracting content, formatting with Prettier v3.4.2, and submitting the Markdown. The user's input in a text box showing example markdown content: "Ater vulnero solio tabula. Auctus benigne coaegresco defetiscor delinquo. Talio balbus cultura vae. Sint deripio tener adfectus agnitio aro cruentus arbustum. Abstergo alii sollers." is marked as "Incorrect. Try again.".  The accompanying text mentions that getting the correct Markdown output from a PDF is very hard, requiring manual corrections, but formatting with Prettier will help.

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.

I have tried these steps:

```
import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())

```

Then i run this in bash

```
prettier --write output.md

```

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.

#Can someone please advise me a better approach?

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) Sir I have done the question 2 of the graded assignment but I am very curious to know why the answers language gets periodically change. Is there some kind of backend code which is responsible for that or is something else ?

Yes we’ll were facing this issue.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir mentioned yesterday that they will change the question.

"We will be changing this question. Even we found it hard

Kind regards"

So need to worry about that question for now.

On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.

(FYI, one person *did* solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.)

Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables…

But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?

Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List (I tried with other symbols \* and + also) . Please inform me where I made mistake  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a problem with markdown content, likely within a data science learning platform. The question asks for the markdown content of a PDF, formatted with "prettier@3.4.2". The displayed text resembles a list of items: "- cuppedia tamquam facilis confugo", "- conservo depereo", "- consectetur arx", "- aeternus celebrer". However, each list item is underlined with a red wavy line, suggesting an error. At the bottom of the box the error message reads "Error: Missing lists". This indicates the system is not recognizing the provided text as correctly formatted markdown lists.

this is table. Check it

Below is the screenshot of provided PDF. That font colour strains my eyes. Any particular reason for that PDF?



> **Image:** The screenshot displays an unusual collection of Latin words and phrases, resembling a word cloud or a randomly generated text passage.  No code snippets or error messages are visible. UI elements are absent; it seems to be an image of text only. There are no discernible data visualizations or charts. The text includes isolated words like "cresco," "deputo," and full sentences like "Depraedor vae dedecor conturbo". It's difficult to infer the specific technical issue from this context.

Even I’m getting a similar error in Q2, it is expecting a foreign title whereas my search result gives only English titles.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data validation error within a data science course forum.  The user is attempting to validate JSON data representing movie information, including "id", "title", "year", and "rating". The error message "Error: At [12].title: Values don't match" indicates a discrepancy in the 'title' field. The system expected the value '"13. Pídeme lo que quieras"' (Spanish), but the provided JSON contained '"13. Ask Me What You Want"'. This suggests a validation process with specific language or data requirements.

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.

Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

What format is required for the “missing links” here  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science exercise about converting a PDF to Markdown format using `prettier@3.4.2`. The task involves providing the Markdown content of a PDF, which is displayed in a text area on the UI. However, an error message "Error: Missing links" is shown at the bottom. The exercise description acknowledges the difficulty of the conversion process, stating that manual corrections are likely needed. No charts or visual representations of data are present.

1. There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.  
   All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as link texts same as in pdf.

Link text

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,  
below error is still observed.

Error: Missing links

Did anyone else face same issue ?

2. Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.  
   But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

In Q2. getting , able to fix most of the errors but  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays an IMDb search result filtered by user ratings between 4.0 and 8.0, alongside the Chrome DevTools Console panel. The console shows a JSON response with movie data including "id", "title", "year", and "rating". The "year" value for "14. High Potential" and "19. The Recruit", and "20. The Rookie" contains a hyphen ("2024-", "2022-", and "2018-" respectively) suggesting potential missing or incomplete year data. The console data appears to be what's driving the rendered IMDb search results seen on the left. The user likely wants to know how to properly handle these incomplete year entries.



Error: At [18].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “19. Graymail”. Actual: “19. The Recruit”

this kind of errors for some titles, even though i only applied Rating filter and nothing else, then why i’m getting different titles then the test cases?

i am facing issue in Q7.

I am using this command : “<https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:Seattle+followers:>>120&sort=created&order=desc”

and the output on evaluating is : 2011-05-07T08:30:48Z

But i am getting the error :  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a problem involving the GitHub API to find users in Seattle with over 120 followers and identifying the newest user. The task requires formatting the creation date in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z").  The user has entered "2011-05-07T08:30:48Z" in a text input field. An error message "Incorrect. Try again." is displayed below the input field, indicating the entered date is incorrect.  The instructions prompt to filter by location and followers, sort by "joined descending", fetch the first URL, and enter the "created_at" field, specifically excluding users joined after "2/7/2025, 11:00:55 PM".



Can someone please help me on this ?

I am also facing the same issue. What is the problem here?

The task involves using the BBC Weather API to get weather forecasts for London and constructing a JSON object where the `issueDate` maps to the `enhancedWeatherDescription`.

[@21F1005510](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

**Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

This is the only thing which worked for me.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB. The current example on the portal is:  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python list of dictionaries representing movie data. Each dictionary contains "id", "title", "year", and "rating" keys. The data structure appears to be simplified with only two movie entries fully shown, indicated by the comment "// ... more titles". The problem likely involves working with this structured movie data, such as loading, parsing, or performing analysis. The data seems to be correctly formatted as JSON.

Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.

I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?

In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.  
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

Good idea [@23f2005138](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2005138) and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads:

```
[
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.

For the particular instance - `“2024–”`, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

GA 4 Q2

My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ?



> **Image:** The screenshot displays details for the movie "2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey." Key information includes the release year (2023), runtime (1h 24m), rating status ("Not Rated"), and user rating of 2.9 based on 33K votes. The UI also indicates a "Rate" option for users.  The movie has a Metascore of 16.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data validation error in a data science context, specifically a JSON comparison issue.  The JSON data contains "title": "25. Battlefield Earth" along with "year" and "rating" fields. The error message "Error: At [1].title: Values don't match" indicates a mismatch between expected and actual values for the 'title' field at index 1 of a data structure.  The "Expected" value is "'2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey'" while the "Actual" value is '"2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey"', suggesting a possible typo with either the expected or actual values, such as using "-" rather than "_".



contradiction :  
" 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) & ( delivered by the JSON)  
" 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) & ( raising error statement )

I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON-like data structure containing movie information, including "id", "title", "year", and "rating". The title of the movie is "11. Kraven the Hunter". An error message is displayed indicating a mismatch in values at "[10].title": "Error: At [10].title: Values don't match. Expected: "11. Kraven: The Hunter". Actual: "11. Kraven the Hunter"". Although the strings appear identical, a subtle difference (possibly whitespace or character encoding) is causing the validation failure. This suggests a data validation or testing issue within the course material.

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be multiple titles need to be translated by this method.

This implies that the scraper's functionality may be broken or producing unexpected results, potentially due to regional differences or data updates on IMDb.

I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error

Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (`2.9`) and not a string (`"2.9"`) in your code.

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.

But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the API key  
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code a few times before getting in right

I am getting this error again and again after running the code in collab this city `Nur-Sultan`?  



> **Image:** The code snippet shows a Python f-string on line 35 attempting to construct a URL using a `location_id` variable. A `NameError` exception, "name 'location_id' is not defined," indicates the `location_id` variable was used within the f-string before it was assigned a value. The error originates from a Jupyter Notebook cell, as indicated by `<ipython-input-9-128760ee996a>`. The overarching error message "Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan" suggests a problem in retrieving/defining this ID for the city of Nur-Sultan.

I’m getting the same error in Q4:

The expected output format, displayed above, uses date strings (e.g., "2025-01-01") as keys and weather descriptions as values.

Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct.

This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.

Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate & enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days)

Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference.

Code:

```
import requests

url = "https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/aggregated/" + getlocid('Bogota')
response = requests.get(url)
json_data=response.json()
print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")

weather_data = {}

for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
  issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
  weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
  weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description
  print("Iteration No. " + str(i))
  print(issue_date)
  print(weather_description)
  
print("Final Weather Data json below")
print(weather_data)

```

Output

Sir I have solved Q2, But a problem arises that, At the index 11, in the IMdb website it is listed “The Recruit” but it is showing Expected: “Graymail”.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a snippet of JSON data representing a list of movie/show titles with their IDs, years, and ratings. An error message is present at the bottom stating "Error: At [11].title: Values don't match. Expected: "12. Graymail". Actual: "12. The Recruit"". The error indicates a data validation issue where the title at index 11 of the data list is expected to be "12. Graymail", but the actual value found is "12. The Recruit". This suggests a mismatch between expected and actual data in the `title` field for the element at index 11. Some `year` fields also contain a trailing hyphen.

you have to manually change for a few mismatch.

s.anand:

> [@21F1005510](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.  
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:  
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00  
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00  
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.

Please help with the second issue.

1. For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.  
   How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.

> Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.

2. I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON data submission form in a data science course, related to a streaming service's content acquisition strategy. The student submits JSON data containing "id", "title", "year", and "rating" of a movie. However, an error message appears: "Error: At [10].year: Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021"", indicating a validation failure on the "year" field. The expected year format might require a trailing character that is missing. The text at the bottom indicates that IMDb search results may differ and that the scraper code may need to be rerun.



  
how to tackle this error as in 10 th movie year is 2025 but it is showing 2021

City in my question is `Nur-Sultan` .When i search `Nur-Sultan` city name in BBC weather page .its show nothing . when i search in google then show Nur Sultan become Astana . then i am going this city name "Astana ". and got location id 1526273. after i run in collab then showing error.  



> **Image:** The code is attempting to retrieve weather data from the BBC website using the `requests` library. An `IndexError: list index out of range` exception occurred in line 24. The error arises when trying to access the first element (index 0) of the "results" list within the JSON response from the BBC Weather API. This suggests that the "results" list is empty in some cases, leading to the indexing error when trying to get the first element. The relevant code snippet causing the error is `weather_url = 'https://www.bbc.com/weather/' + result['response'] ['results'] ['results'][0]['id']`.

this error comes, whenever you answer the other ones and click save. Please answer this question lastly, and submit immediately. it changes within a second. If it continues means, do manual correction and change according to the “expected”

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a forum question about extracting Markdown content from a PDF using prettier@3.4.2. The provided Markdown content appears to have words underlined in red, indicating issues with word recognition or separation. An error message states: "Error: Words like back, legislature, info are missing (or not separated as words)." This suggests that the tool is struggling to accurately parse the PDF's text into distinct words, leading to missing or combined words in the extracted Markdown. The question highlights the difficulty of reliably converting PDFs to Markdown, often requiring manual correction.

I didn’t get any error for Astana.  
The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14 pairs.

* Select ‘Fetch/XHR’.
* Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. **Do not press Enter** while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api\_key=…’ to disappear.
* ‘location?api\_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu.
* Double-click it to open a web page ([https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api\_key={api\_key}](https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key=%7Bapi_key%7D)). This will give the API.

Hi Team,

I have made the JSON from the IMDB website using JS, But do i miss any filter conditions,  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON data structure and an error message related to a data mismatch. The JSON data includes fields like "year" and "rating".  The error, "Error: At [10].title: Values don't match. Expected: "11. Sebastian Fitzeks Der Heimweg". Actual: "11. The Calendar Killer"", indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual title at the 10th index. The text below the error suggests that IMDb search results can vary and may require manual translation or re-running the scraper code. There aren't any data visualizations or charts.



  
I took first 25 films which 5 to 6 rating, but json seems to be different.

Could anyone please tell me what i did wrong here?

The correct answer is highlighted as "Correct" with a green checkmark. The text emphasizes the difficulty of accurately converting PDFs to markdown, implying manual correction might be necessary even with `prettier`.

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors

yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.

but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

It is written in the ques to get the link in the link tag. Not the post link. Like this

The XML structure includes `<rss>`, `<channel>`, and `<item>` tags, defining the feed's metadata and individual news articles.

A notable element is the `<link>https://modal.com/docs/examples/slack-finetune</link>` that appears relevant to a particular article.  The XML content appears to be well-formed and parsable, displayed without apparent errors.

The keys are dates (e.g., "2025-02-10"), and the values are strings describing the weather (e.g., "Sunny and a gentle breeze"). An error message "Error: At root: Different number of properties" suggests that the JSON structure is not being parsed correctly, or that the number of top-level properties is not consistent with what the parser expects. This might be related to the program that tries to parse the string as JSON has an issue. The prompt question asks about the weather forecast description, suggesting the user is trying to extract this information.



  
sir earlier it was correct and now i submit it again after running my code it shows error. sir i have done it correct two times earlier. but now again as i click on save button it changed. these tasks are taking too much time and creating more difficulties. please look into this [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)

i 'm here for the bonus marks,

But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.

We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.

And i have never seen any course cool as this,

* like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (*and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom , gave client side answer checks’s code to `o1` and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this*)
* keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.  
  ( *i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem* )

Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the portal?

There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.

if you look closely the expected value is `2024-`  and actual that you are supplying is `2024`.  
Difference ? your value does have a `-` and a space at the end.  
reason ? you might be scraping it ? `trim()` or maybe using `innerText` to get tag’s text ?

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.  
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”  
What am I suppose to do? [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini)  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a coding problem related to fetching weather data for Nur-Sultan from the BBC Weather API. The task involves retrieving the city's `locationId`, extracting `issueDate` and `enhancedweatherDescription`, and transforming the data into a JSON object. The provided code snippet attempts to create a JSON object, but results in the error: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')". This indicates that the code is likely trying to access the `id` property of an undefined object during data retrieval or transformation. The UI shows a text box where the user input the weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan.



Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database:  
{  
“2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”,  
“2025-02-10”: “Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze”,  
“2025-02-11”: “Sunny and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-12”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”,  
“2025-02-13”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”,  
“2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-16”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-17”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-18”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-19”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-20”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,

Beyond the specific tools mentioned (like `IMPORTHTML` in Google Sheets or `httpx` and `lxml` in Python), what are the broader *ethical considerations* when scraping data from websites, and how can developers ensure they are acting responsibly and respecting website owners’ rights and resources?

Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest.

the answer format is correct the link is probably not the latest one, I had the same issue because my code was working only for the first 100 entries… you should try paginating your code so it can cover more entries

Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?

* Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
* If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
* If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a forum post about a Python coding error. The user, "22f2000008," is encountering a "NameError: name 'location_id' is not defined" when trying to fetch weather data for "Nur-Sultan".  The traceback points to line 35: `weather_url = f'https://www.bbc.com/weather/{location_id}'`, indicating that the `location_id` variable hasn't been properly defined before being used in the f-string. The initial error "Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan" may suggest that the value for location ID is not being retrieved or assigned correctly. The user mentions they are using Google Colab.



  
As you can see in this screen shot i already tried this question and getting error so i posted it on discourse. But still i did not get any marks for attempting this question.  
i got only 9/10.

Hello [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir,  
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.

Hoping for a positive response.  
Thanks & Regards

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a discussion thread titled "GA4 - Data Sourcing" within a data science course forum.  Users are discussing updates not being reflected on their portals, as stated by "rohitgarg" ("ig, they have not updated. not reflected on my portal too"). "carlton", a Course TA, asks "@23f3002537, @21f3000745, @Jeleshiya" if they received the "Nur-Sultan parameter," implying a question about grading or assignment completion. Navigation elements on the left sidebar show "Courses", "Operational Issues", and "clarification" tags, suggesting organizational categories for discussion threads. The thread is long, with "360 / 364" indicating a high number of posts.



  
I am not saying anything regarding bonus marks. I am asking GA4 q4 about  
Nur-Sultan in this question everyone getting error after post in discourse ,sir say who attempt this question get a marks .But i am not recieved this question marks

if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard?

I don’t think it is added in my case.

It will show up as 110 marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.

Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I understand that each set of students get different questions.
