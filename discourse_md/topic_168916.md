No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a table-like UI, possibly from a grading or validation system for student projects.  Each row represents a check on a student's (22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) project, identified by a URL (e.g., "https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1"). Two entries show "FAIL" results, with the "message" column indicating the reason. The first failure is "No public DockerHub image" for type "Docker" and the second is "No Dockerfile" for type "Dockerfile", suggesting problems with Docker-related aspects of the submission. Other checks for "Repo", "License" and "Clone" show "OK" statuses with respective messages "exists", "LICENSE", and "Cloned".



You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.

Kind regards

> **Image:** This screenshot shows the image of a monster about to devour a human. On the left side of the image there is a written text "Tools in Data Science". Overall, the screenshot represents the tools being difficult to learn in data science.

> **Image:** This image is unsuitable for technical analysis as it depicts a monster attacking a human, with the text "Tools in Data Science" overlaid. There are no code snippets, error messages, UI elements, data visualizations, or other technical content. The image serves as a metaphorical representation of the challenges or overwhelming aspects of data science tools rather than a display of technical issues. It is not possible to provide a relevant technical description.
