Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton),  
My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.

Regards,  
Ajit

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by.

Kind regards

**Key Information (Visual Description):**

*   **Subject:** A man with a dark beard and slicked-back dark hair.
*   **Attire:** He is wearing dark (likely black) square-framed sunglasses, a black collared shirt open at the neck, and a black suit jacket/blazer. He has a dark watch on his left wrist and a dark pendant on a chain around his neck. There's a ring on his right hand.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log of automated checks performed for a student submission, likely for a data science course project. Each row represents a specific check, showing its outcome and relevant details.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Student Identity:** All entries are for the same student, identified by the email address `22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
2.  **Project Submission Context:** The checks primarily revolve around a GitHub repository for "Project-1" and a potential Docker image.
3.  **Check Outcomes:**
    *   **Two Failed Checks (`FAIL`):**
        *   **Docker Image:** The system attempted to find a Docker image associated with `dog/diya` but failed because `No public DockerHub image` was found.
        *   **Dockerfile Presence:** For the GitHub repository `https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1`, the check for a Dockerfile failed with the message `No Dockerfile`. This is a critical failure for containerization.
    *   **Three Successful Checks (`OK`):**
        *   **Repository Existence:** The GitHub repository `https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1` was successfully located, indicated by `exists`.
        *   **License File:** A `LICENSE` file was found within the repository.
        *   **Repository Cloning:** The GitHub repository was successfully `Cloned`.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Email:** `22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (appears in all rows)
*   **URLs:**
    *   `dog/diya` (for Docker image check)
    *   `https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1` (for GitHub repository checks)
*   **Result Messages:**
    *   `FAIL`
    *   `OK`
*   **Type Messages:**
    *   `Docker`
    *   `Repo`
    *   `License`
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `Clone`
*   **Detailed Messages:**
    *   `No public DockerHub image`
    *   `exists`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `No Dockerfile`
    *   `Cloned`*



You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.

Kind regards

> 

> **Image Content:** *This image does not appear to be a screenshot from a data science course forum. It is a promotional image or still, likely from a film or photo shoot, depicting a man in a suit, sunglasses, and a beard, holding a cigar and leaning on a car.

Therefore, there is no key information, code, commands, or error messages related to data science to transcribe or analyze from this image.*





> **Image Content:** *This image is a dramatic, illustrative graphic rather than a traditional technical screenshot from a data science course forum.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Visual Content:** The image features a large, menacing creature (resembling Godzilla or a dinosaur) with its mouth wide open, positioned behind a screaming man who appears to be bloodied and in distress. The man is wearing sunglasses and a beard, and his expression conveys extreme fear or pain. The overall scene is chaotic and intense, set against a dark, cloudy sky.
2.  **Overlaid Text:** Prominently displayed in white text on the body of the creature, in the upper-left portion of the image, are the words:
    *   `Tools`
    *   `in Data`
    *   `Science`

**Interpretation in a Data Science Forum Context:**

Given its dramatic and non-technical nature, this image likely serves as a visual metaphor or an attention-grabbing graphic for a discussion or module related to "Tools in Data Science."

*   **Probable Purpose:** It most likely illustrates the common feeling of being overwhelmed, challenged, or even "devoured" by the sheer number, complexity, or difficulty of learning and mastering the various tools (e.g., programming languages like Python/R, libraries, frameworks, databases, cloud platforms, etc.) required in the field of data science. The screaming, bloodied man could represent a student or practitioner struggling with these demands.
*   **Possible Use Cases:** This could be a thread banner, a title card for a video lecture, an opening image for a forum discussion post, or even a humorous (though intense) meme used to express the challenges faced by learners.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this image. The only text is the descriptive phrase "Tools in Data Science".*

> 

> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this image from a data science course forum, here's the key information:

**Overall Context/Impression:**
This image appears to be a graphic or meme rather than a screenshot of a functional forum interface. It uses a dramatic, almost horror-movie-like visual metaphor to convey a message related to "Tools in Data Science." The tone suggests that the topic might be challenging, overwhelming, or even "monstrous" for those encountering it.

**Key Visual Information:**
The image features a large, menacing creature (resembling Godzilla or a kaiju) with its mouth wide open, teeth bared, and a long tongue visible. It is positioned behind and seemingly attacking or roaring at a man. The man is bearded, wearing glasses, and appears terrified, screaming, with blood spatter on his face and suit, indicating distress or injury. The background is a murky, overcast sky. The overall aesthetic is dark and intense.

**Transcribed Text:**
The following text is overlaid in white, sans-serif font in the top-left corner of the image:

```
Tools
in Data
Science
```

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this image. It is purely a visual graphic with overlaid text.

**Potential Implication/Interpretation:**
In the context of a data science course forum, this image likely serves as:
*   **A humorous (or stark) representation of the challenges:** Suggesting that navigating or mastering the multitude of tools in data science can be daunting, overwhelming, or feel like a battle.
*   **An attention-grabbing title card:** For a discussion thread, a module, or a presentation about the various tools (e.g., Python, R, SQL, cloud platforms, visualization tools, machine learning libraries) that data scientists must learn and manage.
*   **A relatable meme:** For students or practitioners who might feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of the ecosystem of data science tools.*
