Sir,  
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.  
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi [@Sakshi6479](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/sakshi6479),

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum details an opportunity for students to earn bonus marks.

**Key Information:**

*   **Subject:** Bonus marks are being offered for engagement on the course's discussion forum.
*   **Purpose:** The initiative aims to "encourage discussions" among students.
*   **Target Audience:** Specifically, "IITM BS students".
*   **Platform:** The discussions are to take place on "Discourse".
*   **Action Required:** Students must "reply to the discussion" with a "relevant question or reply".
*   **Specific Discussion Thread:** The required engagement is on a particular thread titled "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]", which is indicated as a link.
*   **Reward:** Successful participation will earn the student "1 bonus mark".
*   **Application of Mark:** This bonus mark will be applied to a "graded assignment".

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code, command, or error messages in the traditional sense (e.g., programming syntax, terminal commands, or system errors). However, the specific discussion thread title, which acts as a unique identifier or "command" to direct student action, is provided and transcribed exactly as it appears:

`GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]`*



We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards

**Reactions:** ❤️ 1
