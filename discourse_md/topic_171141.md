Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?

All the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

## How to fix bugs in our scripts

Create Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .

### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**

If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:  
[Submit Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing)

## Bug fixes

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.

We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.

This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays information about a Docker image tagged "latest" and pushed by "pradeepmondal." A "Copy" button allows the user to copy the command "docker pull pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest". Other listed details include the image digest "a4d9cad3b5f5," OS/ARCH "linux/arm64/v8", "Last pull" date of "1 day", and a compressed size of "179.2 MB". This interface likely enables users to inspect and pull Docker images from a repository.



Even just now I tried running the exact image:  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the output of a `podman run` command, used to execute a container.  The command includes options to remove the container on exit (`--rm`), set an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and map port 8000. After running the command, messages indicate the server started successfully, and Uvicorn is running at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.  The prompt informs the user that they can quit the application by pressing `CTRL+C`. There are no errors visible in the output.



It is running fine on my macbook air m1 (ARM)

My evaluation log file is missing.  
The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,  
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07

My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.  
tds-project-1 latest c854274f078d 5 weeks ago 1.38GB  
ayush6871/fastapi-agent latest 27e8375b0ab1 6 weeks ago 1.66GB

I am requesting to look into this case. I think there has been some mistake somewhere.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86\_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

* **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We *may* pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

Would you mind reviewing the evaluation.log screenshot I have attached? I believe I may deserve marks for Task B6. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton), could you kindly take a look?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a failed test ("B6 FAILED") related to data validation.  The system scraped data to "./data/b6.json" via a GET request to localhost. An "EXPECTED" list of authors is displayed, followed by the "RESULT" which is a JSON structure containing an ".author" array.  The "RESULT" differs from the "EXPECTED" list in structure (JSON object vs. list) and potentially in the encoding of "André Gide" and therefore the test failed. The problem is that the program is expected a simple list, and scraped a JSON object containing the list.

can you please take a look at this screenshot?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a failing test case where an LLM is tasked to extract a credit card number from an image and write it to a file. The POST request to `http://localhost:8001/run` sends the image and task details. Although the server returns an HTTP 200 indicating success, the comparison reveals a mismatch. Specifically, the expected credit card number is "6011598665215965" but the extracted result is "6011598656215965", indicating an error in the number extraction. The UI highlights the failing file `/data/cc-number.txt` along with expected vs actual values.



  
The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7**, **B8**, and **B10**, the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a data science course forum interaction. Task B6 successfully extracted authors from a website and saved them to `/data/b6.json`. The Python code snippet shows the web scraping logic using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Task B7, downloading and resizing an image, failed, as indicated by the red "X" and "B7 FAILED". Task B8 also failed due to "not all arguments converted during string formatting".

Hi [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

The contents of Expected and Result matches, but still test case’s failed.  
Is there formatting check for answer , Isn’t prettier to be done ?  
I see that your expected answer isn’t formatted using prettier , am i wrong ?

eg:

EXPECTED:  
[{‘first\_name’: ‘Kevin’, ‘last\_name’: ‘Allen’, ‘email’: ‘tonya41@example.com’}, {‘first\_name’: ‘Kimberly’, ‘last\_name’: ‘Allison’, ‘email’: ‘vmendoza@example.com’}, {‘first\_name’: ‘Kathleen’, ‘last\_name’: ‘Baldwin’, ‘email’: ‘amclean@example.com’}, {‘first\_name’: ‘Jason’, ‘last\_name’: ‘Banks’, ‘email’: ‘sharptara@example.org’}, {‘first\_name’: ‘Tami’, ‘last\_name’: ‘Bass’, ‘email’: ‘kristy61@example.com’}, {‘first\_name’: ‘Brenda’, …

RESULT:  
[  
{  
“first\_name”: “Kevin”,  
“last\_name”: “Allen”,  
“email”: “[tonya41@example.com](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/mailto:tonya41@example.com)”

Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

23f3003302:

> Hi [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

[@23f3003302](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f3003302) output from your server’s response is correct, we will update our evaluation script.

23f2004912:

> 

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a failed test case (B6 FAILED) related to data scraping. It reveals a mismatch between "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" for the content of "/data/b6.json". The "EXPECTED" data is a simple list of author names. The "RESULT" is a JSON object with a single key ".author" which contains a list of author names, indicating a structural difference is causing the test to fail. The server returned a HTTP 200 OK status implying the file was retrieved successfully, but the contents were not as expected by the test.



[@23f2004912](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2004912) We will discuss internally if we can do something about it, but I can’t assure if you will get marks for it, since output from your server is a bit different.

23f1001611:

> 

> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a series of task execution results, including HTTP requests and Python code. Task B6 involves scraping author names from a website and saving them to a JSON file, and it "PASSED". However, Task B7, which involves downloading and resizing an image, "FAILED". Task B8 also failed with the error "not all arguments converted during string formatting". The UI indicates failures with a red "X" and the word "FAILED," pointing to problems within the image processing or string formatting steps.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.

Same issue for me sir. When I evaluated my file using evaluate.py my 9 cases out of the 10 in Task A was passed but the email I received shows that my evaluation log file is missing. I don’t understand why does it show like that. Please do check and help me out sir.

It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows error logs from a data science course forum, indicating issues with file paths and server requests. "HTTP 500" errors with detail messages like '"detail": "500: [Errno 2) No such file or directory: '/app./data/mail.txt'"" suggest files are missing or not found at the specified locations, causing internal server errors. "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" errors further confirm resource retrieval problems through GET requests, e.g., for `/data/mail-sender.txt`. The tasks described, such as extracting credit card numbers from images and finding similar comments using embeddings, also seem to be failing, indicated by "A7 FAILED" and "A8 FAILED" messages.

The `read_file` function attempts to read a file specified by the `path` parameter and returns its content or raises HTTPExceptions for missing file path (status code 400), file not found (status code 404), or other errors (status code 500). Error handling includes checking if the path exists and resides within the designated "data folder."

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86\_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

[@23f2001975](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2001975) we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

> **Image:** The traceback indicates a `KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'` within a Python script. The error occurs when trying to access the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` using `os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']` on line 30 of `/app/app.py`. The KeyError signifies that this environment variable is not defined in the system's environment. The traceback leads from the script to a built-in OS function (`_getitem__`) which is called when accessing environment variables. The issue stems from the code's attempt to retrieve a non-existent environment variable.



This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this.

@cartlon Same issue.

My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Can you please rerun the image on ARM based

You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.  



> **Image:** The traceback indicates a `KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'` in the Python code.  Specifically, the error originates from line 30 in `/app/app.py`, where the code attempts to retrieve an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` using `os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`. The `KeyError` means the specified environment variable is not set in the environment where the script is running. This implies the application is expecting the `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable to be defined prior to execution.

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

```
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

```

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY\_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

Furthermore, POST requests to `/run` return "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" along with the message "HTTP 500 { "detail": ""choices'" }".

I encountered the same issue with `evaluate.py`. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with `evaluate.py`, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a test failure related to a log file located at `/data/logs-latest.txt`. The "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections display text, apparently read from the log file, that should match.  However, the test "A5" has "FAILED", suggesting a discrepancy between the expected content and the actual content of the log file.  The text shown in the result matches the expected output, so either there's an additional test that is not shown in the screenshot or the result shown isn't the whole result. No specific code snippets or data visualizations are visible.

Yes, I agree.

I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

No no sir, I can send you an SS of my code, it’s very much there sir, the tasksA file, i really don’t know why this happened.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Visual Studio Code IDE interface.  The file explorer on the left displays a project directory including files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `requirements.txt`, etc. The editor panel displays code with line numbers; line 20 has an unclosed parenthesis. The "PROBLEMS" panel shows a potential issue. At the bottom, there's a status message saying "Python extension loading..." implying a delay in the Python extension initialization.

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.  
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY app.py /app

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

```

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) good afternoon sir,  
I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20.  
Thank you sir

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.
2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.
3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.
4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.

I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs.

Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container.  
If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.

That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.

Just look at docker\_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

There is a mistake in the url I guess check this out I have a fully functional image which was pushed 1 month ago  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows Docker image management within a repository named "pscodes24/dataworks-agent".

A "Docker commands" section provides the command `docker push pscodes24/dataworks-agent:tagname` to push a new tag. There are search and filter options for images, suggesting the user is looking to manage the existing Docker images in this repository.

The "EXPECTED" output included a header "# Header" and a table with columns Start, Mid, and End. The "RESULT" section shows the actual output, which contains newline characters and incorrect spacing in the generated markdown.  Specifically, the produced string contains literal "\n" characters instead of actual newlines, and the table formatting is broken. The task A2 has failed due to these discrepancies between expected and actual markdown output. A snippet `print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")` is involved in generating the expected output.

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path\_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python traceback indicating a `KeyError: 'USER_EMAIL'`. This error occurs in `/app/main.py` at line 22, where the code attempts to access the environment variable "USER_EMAIL" using `os.environ["USER_EMAIL"]`. The traceback indicates that the "USER_EMAIL" environment variable is not set. The error originates from within the `os.py` library. The traceback also reveals the application is using `uvicorn`, `click`, and standard python libraries.



Sir so the user\_email isn’t passed while pulling the docker image?

Thank you.

Hello,

My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether `datagen.py` was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the `/data` folder into the container. Could you please clarify this?

Sir, I checked my evaluation log, and the error occurred because the **AI proxy token limit was exceeded**. I ran the evaluation script to verify, and I scored **12/20**.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Flask application running in debug mode and encountering `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'`. The error originates in `app.py` line 22, within the `run_task` function, specifically at `action = classification.get("action", "").lower()`.  The stack trace indicates the issue stems from a POST request to `/run` with a task parameter.  Multiple HTTP requests are visible, including POST requests to `/run` and GET requests to `/read`, with status codes 500 (Internal Server Error) and 404 (Not Found) respectively.





> **Image:** The screenshot indicates issues with accessing a database file and reading a CSV file. Specifically, the error message `"error": "unable to open database file"` suggests a problem connecting to or locating the database. A GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/b10.csv` results in a "404 NOT FOUND" error, and the message "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" further confirms the failure to read the specified CSV file. A later POST request to an OpenAI embeddings endpoint is successful ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK"), but the overall score is 12/20 suggesting other errors exist.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python traceback related to font loading in the PIL (Pillow) library.  The code attempts to load "arial.ttf" and "DejaVuSans.ttf" fonts using `ImageFont.truetype()`, but fails with an `OSError: cannot open resource`. The traceback indicates the error originates within the PIL library's `freetype()` and `FreeTypeFont()` functions, specifically during the font initialization. The error occurs within the `a8_credit_card_image()` function in the `/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py` script. The script is being run with a "POST /run?" request including Install instructions.



The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?  



> **Image:** The code snippet shows a series of Python function calls, starting from `a2_format_markdown()` to `a10_ticket_sales()`. The functions are named sequentially suggesting they might be related to a set of exercises or assignments (a2 to a10). There are no error messages or UI elements visible in the snippet. The image depicts a list of named function calls in a dark-themed editor environment.



  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you

A subsequent HTTP POST request to localhost:8503 resulted in a "500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR".

this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Kind regards

Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK

```
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


```

Similarly for task B2.

```
INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?  
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build

```
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

```

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Checkin url: [Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub](https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25/commit/a71e3a84b284d7621f2a769308340454ebd58583)

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

Hello sir

I noticed that the log mentioned:  
“python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.”

However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!

on a side note, to validate and test our docker/podman images on a platform outside of our dev environment we can use <https://labs.play-with-docker.com/>.. this is a free platform to download run and test docker images …

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe\_open function that will throw a HTTP\_403\_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

Dear sir, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2 months back. I actually don’t know how this issues come in, please resolve this.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a report of prerequisite checks for a data science project. The checks evaluate the presence and accessibility of a GitHub repository, a Dockerfile, and an MIT license. The evaluation of the Docker image hosted in Dockerhub shows "PASS", but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license checks all report "FAIL". The command `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` specifies how the Docker image should run. The overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0" indicate the project submission will not be evaluated further.

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Kind regards

> **Image:** The email indicates that the student's Project 1 failed the prerequisite checks.

I’ve already received my score in the evaluation log. Additionally, the Docker Hub run logs show no errors, and both the GitHub repo and Docker image are publicly accessible. All the content has been verified and meets the prerequisites.

Let me know if any further action is needed from my end.

Because of the Docker image failure, the overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" and the "Project 1 Score: 0" are displayed. The student needs to correct the Docker image issue to proceed.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jayeshbansal) ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a table-like structure containing information submitted by a user, likely related to a data science project. The user's email address is "24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". They provided a GitHub repository link: "https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/" as the code location for Project 1. The DockerHub image name is "jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3". A search bar with the same email address suggests the table can be filtered.

The log file provided to me too contains File not found error for task A. However, running the code on the evaluate.py files gave me results. Could you please look into the datagen part?

It is the request to the team,to consider this since it is a problem of just a case letter otherwise the whole hardwork of doing the project will be wasted.

Dear instructors, I received the mail today regarding project 1 TDS scores and I have been marked fail because the MIT license is not present. But as can be seen in the screenshot below the MIT license file is present in my GitHub repository. Pls look into this matter.  



> **Image:** This screenshot shows a GitHub repository named "Project1-TDS." The "main" branch contains files and directories, including `Dockerfile`, `MIT LICENSE`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `requirements.txt`. Commit messages indicate actions such as "Initial commit," "committing final files," and "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE." The most recent commit, identified by "ab381b5," was made by "PalakAnand30" 2 months ago and corresponds to renaming the LICENSE file. There are a total of 5 commits to the repository.

It depends where you tested it running, if it’s running inside a docker container and you feel there is problem with our script then you can debug our code and create a pull request on repo.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows the results of a project evaluation. The "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" check has "FAIL" status, which is highlighted with a red circle. Additionally, "Prerequisites: FAIL" is shown, leading to a "Project 1 Score: 0". The checks for Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are all passing, suggesting that the problem lies with the Docker image availability and/or visibility on Docker Hub.

The "Last Pushed" column is sorted in ascending order, indicated by an upward arrow.

The task B6 was  
<https://quotes.toscrape.com/> has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author’s name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

Hi Course Team,

I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one is true?



> **Image:** The email details the prerequisite checks for "TDS Jan 25 Project 1".  The student's submission failed because the "Dockerfile" was not found in the root of their GitHub repository; the evaluation states "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL". The email specifies that the Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`.  The overall prerequisite evaluation is "FAIL" and the project score is 0, indicating the project will not be evaluated further unless all prerequisites are met.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.

I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly

Got a email stating that prereq failed stating below..  
Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL

but i can see that image is public as shown below image.. am i missing something..



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a table-like UI displaying information about a project repository. The repository named "rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25" was last pushed "2 days ago." It "Contains" an "IMAGE," and its "Visibility" is set to "Public." The "Last Pushed" column has an upward-pointing arrow suggesting it is sorted in ascending order.

Given that you noticed an error on our side, you could have informed us about the same. However, you made your changes 22 hours ago, which is not acceptable.

```
tags = httpx.get(
                f"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/{username}/{repo}/tags?ordering=last_updated",timeout = 60
            ).json()
            tag, size = next(
                (
                    (tag["name"], tag["full_size"])
                    for tag in tags.get("results", [])
                    if pd.Timestamp(tag["last_updated"]) <= DEADLINE

Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a GitHub repository named "tds_project-1." Key files present are `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `test.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `MIT LICENSE`, along with a `venv` directory. The repository is on the `main` branch and has 6 commits.  File changes range from "First submission" to "Final Submission," with the "Create LICENSE" commit happening "now." The UI allows the user to navigate to files, add new files, and view the repository code.





> **Image:** The screenshot displays the prerequisite evaluations for Project 1. The evaluation checks for a Docker image in Dockerhub and a public Github repository, both of which passed. While a "Dockerfile" is present in the root of the Github repository, the MIT license is missing from the root, resulting in a "FAIL" status. Consequently, the project's prerequisites are marked as "FAIL", and the Project 1 score is 0.



Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Can you also clarify my issue?

My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log.  
You can check the details in the images below. Screenshot of mail and repository

Roll no. : 21f3001076

[GitHub Repo link](https://github.com/21f3001076/TDS_Project_1)



> **Image:** The screenshot displays prerequisite evaluation results for "Project 1". The check "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" passed, but the checks for "Is Github repo present AND public", "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo", and "Is MIT license present at root of github repo" failed. Consequently, the overall "Prerequisites" status is "FAIL" and the "Project 1 Score" is 0. The user needs to ensure their GitHub repository is public and contains a Dockerfile and MIT license in the root directory to meet the prerequisites.





> **Image:** The screenshot provides instructions for accessing log files.  The first two items list Google Drive links for "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file", respectively, which presumably contain performance reports. The URLs follow the pattern: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/<file_id>/view?usp=drivesdk`. The third item refers to a "Server start log file" available as an attachment and mentions separate logs for "arm vs x86" architectures.  It also states, "If your docker service did not start or respond to attempts to our," which indicates a potential Docker service failure is being addressed.





> **Image:** The screenshot displays a GitHub repository named "TDS Project 1 - LLM-based" owned by user "lakshay654." The repository contains files such as "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "README.md", "app.py", "requirements.txt", and "task_handler.py," all last updated two months ago. The UI shows a file navigation structure with options to view the "README" and "MIT license."  The current branch is "main" with a "Code" dropdown menu. The overall view is focused on the code repository structure, and no error messages or data visualizations are visible.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

***However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.***



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a list of files related to a data science project submission, likely for debugging or analysis. It includes links to an "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file" on Google Drive, with URLs like "https://drive.google.com/file/d/.../view?usp=drivesdk". The other files, like "Server start log file", "Evaluation script file", "Data generation file", "Docker orchestration file", and "Solution script" are listed as attachments (zip). A key piece of information provided is the Docker image ID "11aa22fc1545" that was used for the evaluation. There's also a note that the "Server start log file" contains logs for arm vs x86 architectures, hinting at possible platform-specific issues.



But here’s the catch:\*\* Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:\*

* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
* Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
* Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
* Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
* **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP**, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents**, and it would do that for you—without **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as a **terminal version of** [OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/).

---

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

## To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29**, **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0**—since it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

> **Image:** The screenshot displays automated evaluation results for Project 1 prerequisites. The system checks for a Docker image in Docker Hub, a public GitHub repo, a `Dockerfile` in the repo's root, and an MIT license. While the Docker image, Github repo, and MIT license passed, the "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" test caused the "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0". As a result, the notification states that the "submission will not get evaluated." The student needs to ensure the `Dockerfile` is located in the root directory of their GitHub repository.



  
Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Hi [@thinkmachine](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/thinkmachine)  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.

Once again, thank you both!

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/lakshaygarg654)

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.

Hi [@AryanTikam](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/aryantikam)

I looked at your github repo, You have used python’s `openai` module for doing project1, but AIPROXY\_TOKEN is supposed to be used through anand sir’s proxy.

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows an email reporting the results of prerequisite checks for "TDS Jan 25 Project 1".  Specifically, checks for "Github repo present AND public", "Dockerfile present in root of github repo", and "MIT license present at root of github repo" have all failed. Only the check for "Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" passed. This resulted in an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status, and the email warns that failure to meet requirements will prevent evaluation. The email also includes an example of the `podman run` command required for the project, using variables like `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and `IMAGE_NAME`.

Same for me sir, i had everything correct still its showing:- Is Docker image present in dockerhub

AND is public: FAIL

Because one prerequisite failed, the overall "Prerequisites" status is "FAIL", and the "Project 1 Score" is 0.

Hi Prashant,

Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation.

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.  
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.



> **Image:** This screenshot is an email notification related to a data science course ("TDS Jan 2025"). It alerts students to check their project submissions for basic "sanity" according to the following checklist: "Is the Github repo public?", "Does it have an MIT license?", "Does it have a DockerFile?", and "Is the Docker image accessible?". The email further states that only 284 out of 530+ submissions passed the checks, and students whose submissions failed have been sent separate emails with subject "[IMPORTANT]". It warns that failing these checks puts the Project 1 submission at risk of scoring zero marks.

If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code.

API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by professor anand.

Sir,  
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python error traceback.  The traceback indicates a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'`. This error occurs on line 22 of the `/app/app.py` file, during the execution of the statement `from tasksA import *`.  The problem is that the Python interpreter can't find a module named `tasksA`. The beginning of the output shows successful installation of 33 packages including `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pandas`.



This is my Github repo:



> **Image:** This screenshot depicts a GitHub repository named "tds-project1" owned by "GaURaVinDeX." The file structure includes Python scripts ("app.py," "tasksA.py," "tasksB.py"), a requirements file ("requirements.txt"), a Dockerfile, and a .gitignore file.  The main branch has had two commits made to it, all of which were "Initial commit" two months prior.  There's a prompt to add a README file and the repository is currently set to MIT license with "Python 98.0%" and "Dockerfile 2.0%" indicated in "Languages".



I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Dockerfile within a Github repository named "tds-project1". It begins by using the `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` image and installs dependencies via `apt-get`. It then downloads and installs `uv`, a Python package installer. The Dockerfile copies `app.py` into the `/app` directory within the container using the `COPY` instruction. Finally, it executes the application using `CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]`.



  
You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

Kind regards

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief.

*However* with regards to your long post…

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a *very* experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
2. Wastes valuable time and resources
3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
4. Complicates testing
5. Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards

Hi Sir,  
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is **4db729a03f74** , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.  
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Kind regards

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton). It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) *tedious* assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.

*(…caution: long post ahead )*

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers**: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it’s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

* Reason about the task, understand intent,
* Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
* Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
* Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in [this ICLR 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools**:

* A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
* A Python script runner
* A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was **emergent behavior**, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.

---

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Kind regards

Hello Sir,



> **Image:** The screenshot shows an email from a course team regarding Project 1 prerequisites. The student's Docker image is present and public on Dockerhub, as indicated by the "PASS" status. However, the GitHub repository itself, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license are not found at the root of the repo ("FAIL"). The overall prerequisites evaluation is "FAIL," resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The email includes an example `podman run` command with environment variables: `AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`.



I got this mail regarding my project 1 scores. My github repo is present and public as well as MIT License and Dockerfile is also present at the root of the repo

[github.com](https://github.com/SrishtySnehi/Project_1_tds)



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a GitHub repository named "SrrishtySnehi/Project_1.tds". The repository has one contributor, zero issues, zero stars, and zero forks. The file extension ".tds" suggests that this is likely a Tableau data source file. There are no visible code snippets or error messages to analyze. The central element appears to be a visual representation, potentially the logo or icon associated with the "Project_1.tds" file.

Hi [@Srishty\_Snehi](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/srishty_snehi)

Your submission is valid, we but it failed while running server, with this error.

taskA module missing

For regenerating this error:

1. Pull github repo(latest commit before 18th Feb)
2. Build image using Dockerfile of fetched repo
3. Run that image.

We are not considering Dockerfile’s with wrong name(anything other than Dockerfile), and wrong location(anything other than root) in github repo.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) in earlier evaluation of P1 in that my B1 is passed but in this final scores email it is showing as 0 for B1 pls help  


> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a spreadsheet-like UI element where cell B1 is displaying the numerical value "0".  This likely relates to a programming problem or data analysis task where the result of a computation or data manipulation is being observed. The single cell suggests an intermediate or final output value is being visualized, potentially part of debugging or validation. No error messages or code snippets are visible, limiting insight into the underlying issue. Therefore, the significance of the value "0" within the broader context is unknown without additional information.

  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the status of a task in a data science environment. It indicates "B1 PASSED" with a checkmark, suggesting a previous step was successful.  The current task is "Delete /data/format.md", as indicated by "Running task:". An HTTP POST request is being made to `http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md` with a successful "200 OK" status code. This suggests a file deletion operation is being initiated via an API endpoint.

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files

Dear [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir  
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

* My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
* I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
* I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
* For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .  



> **Image:** The screenshot is an email detailing the scoring for a data science project. The total score is out of 20, normalized based on the highest score in Project 1. Bonus points are awarded based on the number of commits and repo size.  Pre-requisite checks (Docker/Github repo existence & timestamps, LICENSE, Dockerfile) result in binary scores (1 for pass, 0 for fail). A table displaying scores for tasks A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5 shows all values are currently 0.



  



> **Image:** This GitHub repository, "tds_llm_automation-agent," contains Python code related to a TDS project. The visible file list includes `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`, suggesting a workflow involving data generation, evaluation, and task management, likely employing an LLM. The repository also contains a `Dockerfile`, an `.env` file, and a `README`. The "About" section states, "This is my final effort towards tds project." The code is written in Python based on the "Languages" section displaying "Python 100.0%".



  
please just check my repo manually and clarify whether it was public or not . What is going on this degree .

Hi sir  
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.  
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir  
Thank you

I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.

I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.

Dear [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir,  
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.  
Thank you.

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did

Hi Hari,

I just *manually* checked your repo.

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

These instructions are same for everyone. So check first before posting here.

Then post with your queries after testing as mentioned above.  
Also check the evaluation logs first to see why it failed. Address that question.  
Posting “it ran before submission” is insufficient evidence.  
The whole point of deployability is that it runs anywhere at anytime.  
That is what is being tested, not that it ran on your machine (unless you replicate the test environment exactly).

Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.

Dear [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir,  
I run evalution script that you provide us via mail recently, my code is actively running and able to pass 11 task but I was awarded 1 Marks pls check where is the issue,[My full code was done in linux Environment] (github codespace)  



> **Image:** The screenshot indicates a failed HTTP GET request to "http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt", resulting in a "404 NOT FOUND" error. Consequently, task "C5" also failed, reporting "Cannot read /data/c5.txt". The overall score is 11/25. A successful POST request to "https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings" is also shown with a "200 OK" status. Additionally, a pop-up suggests installing the recommended "Python" extension from Microsoft.

**Things i have done for my project to work locally:**

carlton:

> `git clone <your repo url>`

cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the file explorer view within what appears to be a code editor, potentially VS Code. The user is browsing the "TDS_PROJECT_1" project, which contains at least two items: "tds-project-1" (a folder) and "LICENSE" (a file).  The "LICENSE" file is displayed with a yellow key icon, suggesting it might be related to authentication or access rights. There is a green circle displayed that could mean that the file is open or running correctly. The user is likely trying to troubleshoot an issue related to project setup or licensing.



All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.

carlton:

> Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder

when i do this( ) i get this error

carlton:

> `docker build -t <your image name>`

```
PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1> docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build

```

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):  
1)

```
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

```

**OR**  
2)

```
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

```

*Both the things work for me*()

carlton:

> `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name>`

```
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

```

Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)

carlton:

> `uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2003751@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 

```

Done this to evaluate my project

Any finally the main part (DRUM ROLLS ,not this one (IUKUK))



> **Image:** The screenshot from a data science forum shows a student facing issues with a sentiment analysis task. The task is to determine if the statement "I hate you" has a positive or negative connotation, saving either "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" to `/data/c5.txt`. The error message "C5 failed: Server disconnected without sending a response" indicates a server-side issue or network problem. The user scored 6/25 on the assignment.  An HTTP POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returns a "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" response, which may indicate a successful initial connection, but not necessarily a successful complete transaction.

Currently I’m getting a big 0 beacause the github doen’t contain the dockerfile(which it does clearly)

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)

Good evening sir.

My original project evaluation conducted by IITM gave me 7/20, however the new evaluation gave me 0/20.



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the provided screenshot:

The screenshot displays evaluation logs for data science tasks. Task B9 involves converting a URL to `/data/b9.html`. Although the "Convert" task reported success with HTTP 200, a subsequent GET request to read the file failed with the error "Cannot read /data/b9.html". Task B10, which involves running a datasette query on `ticket-sales.csv`, also failed to read `/data/b10.csv`, and the HTTP request returned a 400 error indicating a connection problem and a "Bad Request".  The overall score is displayed as 7/20.



This was from the official evaluation sir, could you kindly look into it.

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

Docker image submitted by you doesn’t exists.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag `"abhay227/version1"` instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is `4db729a03f74`, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.  
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a Google Sheet titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs," potentially used for tracking errors related to student submissions. The sheet contains two columns, "email" and "B," and lists error messages associated with different student email addresses. Common error messages include "taskA module missing", "flask module missing", ".env file missing" and "openai module missing", suggesting issues with missing dependencies. Other error messages like "SyntaxError: unmatched '}'" indicate coding syntax problems, while "Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)" highlights Docker configuration errors. The "View only" indicator suggests the user does not have editing permissions.

The main panel displays "No items match your search.", indicating the search term yields no results within the ZIP archive.  The "Extract all" button is visible, suggesting the user is attempting to view the contents of the zip file. The left pane shows the standard Windows folders (Downloads, Desktop, etc.).



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Windows file explorer window displaying the contents of the Downloads folder. The selected path indicates the user is viewing the "evaluation_logs.zip" file, but the main pane displays the message "No items match your search." This suggests that the ZIP archive is either empty or inaccessible. The user may be experiencing issues extracting or viewing the contents of the "evaluation_logs.zip" archive, despite it being present in the Downloads folder. There are no code snippets or data visualizations visible in the image.



I cannot find my docker\_logs nor evaluation\_logs and nor anything on the forms . The mail I got says that i received 0 in project tasks but clearly my project is not evaluated. Please look into this. during earlier evaluation i got 7 marks but this time it is 0.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a project evaluation report. The student submitted GitHub ("https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1") and Docker repos. Prerequisites checks related to repository existence, public visibility, LICENSE, and Dockerfile presence passed (all marked as "1"). The task score is 0, bonus is 1, and P1 score is 1, so the final score will be based on the formula "MIN (20, (task score + bonus))".  A table (A1-C5) shows further zero-valued scores, perhaps from individual components of the project.



My roll number is 23f1001524 .

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.

Could you rerun the test ?

Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:

```
bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

You can take it up with [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Respected Sir,  
see the above image its from the scores we got from mail just before the latest one, in that I had got 7/20 and now new mail shows I got 0?? how is this possible…  
the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : [23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\_evaluation.log - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNVy9KSfSITZg_KGLF2_wwLWjzNl8mb5/view)  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the results of an automated evaluation of a student's data science project. It includes links to the submitted Github and Docker repositories.  "Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)" indicates the student has passed all listed prerequisites including repository existence, public visibility, timestamp validation, and the presence of LICENSE and Dockerfile. However, a table of values indicates the student received a "task score" of 0 and warnings that an evaluation log will only be generated if the API service starts within 5 minutes.



  
MOST importantly mail shows :  
**Your final t score** calculation is based on

MIN (20, (task score + bonus))

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent](https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent)

**Docker repo submitted:** 23f2001390/llmagent

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**

Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1

Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1  
Your task score is: 0  
Your bonus is: 1  
Your P1 score is: 1

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:  
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker\_logs.zip or evaluation\_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
and nor do i find my id in the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs so please help sir  
Thank you

Hi Hari,

Your docker failed to build.

Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

Thats why there are no logs.  
Kind regards

Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Most common reason for during running docker image was `taskA module was missing` which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

```

here u can see it installs using pip install …

here it’s requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for AIPROXY\_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git doesn’t allow upload of `.env` file I couldn’t upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY\_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because`.env` file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the `.env` file so it didn’t build so I had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports both`.env` file and environment variable one)

But sir, just because the repository doesn’t have .env file it couldn’t build the dockerimage, the docker image will build in any test environment as u said but it requires the .env to be included which the git didn’t have(it doesn’t allow upload of it ofcourse), don’t rerun the evaluation again but please sir atleast give me those 7/20 marks along with the pre-requisite bonus(1mark) that was mailed earlier to me along with logs…this is my primary degree after 12th, I’m also not asking any extra marks just the marks that i got earlier:

Anything after deadline we can’t consider any changes, it was just a matter of time, you didn’t tests running evaluate.py on docker container that was created, otherwise you would have spotted this mistake and rectified it.

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi [@23f1001524](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1001524) [@afsalshah](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/afsalshah) [@23f1000879](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1000879) [@23f1002056](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002056)

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) ,

I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).  



> **Image:** The terminal output shows an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` resulting in a "500 Internal Server Error." Specifically, the message "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" indicates a file reading error, suggesting the file `/data/c5.txt` either doesn't exist or is inaccessible. The test "C5" has failed, as confirmed by the red "X C5 FAILED" message. The overall score is 9/25, and a subsequent POST request to the OpenAI embeddings endpoint seems to have succeeded ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK").



Would really appreciate it if you could take a look. Thanks in advance!

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.

At least docker logs should be there, right?

Dear [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:

```
python run.py

```

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.  
The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

> **Image:** The screenshot depicts the Swagger UI for a FastAPI application, indicating it's running locally at `127.0.0.1:8000`. The UI shows the available API endpoints under the "default" section: `GET /ask`, `POST /run`, and `GET /read`.  The "Schemas" section lists `HTTPValidationError` and `ValidationError` as potentially relevant data structures.  These errors likely indicate data validation issues when interacting with the API endpoints.  The presence of "Expand all" next to each schema suggests a means to view detailed schema definitions.

idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a `Dockerfile` within a GitHub repository. The file sets up a Python 3.12 environment using the `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` image. The `Dockerfile` then proceeds to install system dependencies, the `uv` package manager, and required Python packages like `fastapi` and `uvicorn` using `pip`. Finally, it configures the application directory, copies application files, exposes port 8000, and starts the FastAPI server using `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`. The user interface shows the file tree, with `Dockerfile` highlighted, suggesting they are likely editing or reviewing this Docker configuration.

Dear Sirs,  
[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows instructions for a data science course assignment, focusing on Docker deployment. It highlights creating a Dockerfile, publishing to Docker Hub, and running the image using `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The application should serve APIs at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`. Students are instructed to submit their GitHub repository URL and Docker image name in a Google Form, using placeholders like `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name` and `user-name/repo-name`.



**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent)  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
[https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/blob/main/app/app.py).  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: <https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent>.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

24ds3000090

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.



> **Image:** The code attempts to generate credit card images using the PIL library and custom fonts.  An `OSError: cannot open resource` is raised when the program tries to load font files. The first error occurs when trying to load `arial.ttf`, specified by the code `large_font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", size=60)`. The second error occurs when loading `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf`. The traceback indicates the error originates from the `ImageFont.py` file within the PIL library.



I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python script using `argparse` to handle command-line arguments "email" and "--root" (default "/data"). It creates a directory specified by the "root" argument via `os.makedirs` and stores configurations in a dictionary named `config`. The script prints a disclaimer about changes before evaluation and indicates where files are created.  Functions like `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`, etc. are called at the end of the script, suggesting a modular design. The main issue is likely related to parsing the command line arguments using argparse to run the different function.



  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.

Shivaditya

Hi Haricharan

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.  
This is the error when building it:

```

```



> **Image:** The screenshot shows lines from a Dockerfile. The "WORKDIR /app" instruction sets the working directory within the container. The "COPY" instructions copy files into the container's /app/ directory: "COPY *.py /app/" copies all python files and "COPY .env /app/" copies the .env file. The presence of these "COPY" instructions suggests that the application relies on a .env file containing environment variables and that python files are needed to run the application. The user is likely debugging an issue with how these files are copied into the docker container.



This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards

Your container failed to run after building it.

There is **clearly** *some difference* between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

Hi,

Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a student's submission status for a data science project. It shows submitted GitHub ("https://github.com/swati-iitm/project1_final") and Docker ("swatiiitm/project1_final") repositories.  The "Pre-requisites check" indicates all checks related to the Docker and Github repos were successful. The score is broken down into tables A, B, and C, with each cell having a 0 or 1. The student has a "task score" of 3, a "bonus" of 0, and a "P1 score" of 4, which may contribute to the final t score calculation using "MIN (20, (task score + bonus))".

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

* Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
* when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
* for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
* after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
* As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
* after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
* just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

```

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment

```
docker build -t llm-agent .

```

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

```

and in another terminal

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Thank you

The complete error message, "process "/bin/sh -c uv --version" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127", indicates that the shell couldn't find the executable `uv`. This suggests `uv` wasn't properly installed in the prior Dockerfile steps or is not available in the PATH.

No, we are not allowing any changes to repo after deadline, this is consistent rule for every student. We pulled your github repo latest commit before 18th feb, I am getting following error.

Thanks [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http\_proxy and https\_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS**, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is *linux/amd64* (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1  
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0

I’ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.

Thanks and kind regards.

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

[Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.
> # /// script
> # dependencies = [
> # "requests",
> # ]
> # ///
> import requests
> import datetime as dt
> import zoneinfo
> import argparse
> import os
> import zipfile
> parser = argparse.…

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards

Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo.

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

Kind regards

Thanks for the response [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) .. just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers..

Most files were "added" 2 months ago by user "wag28," except for ".gitattributes" which has an "Initial commit". This suggests a newly initialized project with files ready for containerization and execution. No error messages or data visualizations are present in the image.

I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.

The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.

I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows an email regarding a failed P1 assignment. The key issue was that the submission script couldn't locate the "Dockerfile" in the root directory of the learner's GitHub repository. The course instructor states they are relaxing the requirement of the Dockerfile needing to be in the root directory and will run a directory tree search for the "Dockerfile". Importantly, no changes to the GitHub repo after Feb 18th will be considered, and no spelling deviations are allowed for required files. The email also indicates that the Docker image must build without errors from the Dockerfile and the container must become operational within 5 minutes.

Evaluations are done for such cases where Dockerfile(with name of Dockerfile as `Dockerfile`) was present inside other folders than root folder of your github repo.

Hi [@22f3000819](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3000819)

We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same.

Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
S. Sharmile

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.

Thanks & Kind regards

Hi Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing **Project1**, but I accidentally named the **Dockerfile** as `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’).  
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it.  
Thank you!
