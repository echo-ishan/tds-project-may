Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?

All the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

## How to fix bugs in our scripts

Create Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .

### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**

If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:  
[Submit Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing)

## Bug fixes

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.

We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.

This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, this image provides details about a specific Docker image, likely hosted on a public or private registry like Docker Hub.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Image Repository and Tag:** The image being displayed is identified by the tag "**latest**".
2.  **Full Image Name (for pulling):** The complete name of the Docker image is `pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal`. This naming convention (username/project-name) is typical for personal or course-related projects. The `final-tds-project` strongly suggests it's a final project from a "The Data Science" course.
3.  **Author/Pusher:** The image was last pushed by the user "**pradeepmondal**".
4.  **Last Push Time:** The `latest` tag was last pushed "about 1 month" ago.
5.  **Image Digest:** The unique identifier (digest) for this specific image layer is `a4d9cad3b5f5` (partially visible).
6.  **Operating System and Architecture:** The image is built for `linux/arm64/v8`. This is a crucial detail, indicating it's designed to run on ARM-based processors (like Apple M-series chips, AWS Graviton, or Raspberry Pi), not traditional x86 (Intel/AMD) architectures. If users are on x86 machines, they may encounter compatibility issues or need emulation.
7.  **Last Pull Time:** The image was last pulled "1 day" ago, suggesting recent activity or usage.
8.  **Compressed Size:** The compressed size of the Docker image is **179.2 MB**. This is a relatively compact size for a data science project, implying it might be a lean image or contain only essential components.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **Docker Pull Command:**
    ```
    docker pull pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest
    ```*



Even just now I tried running the exact image:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum shows a successful execution of a Podman command to run a containerized application. The output indicates a smooth startup process for a web server.

Here's the key information:

*   **Action:** The user is running a container using `podman`.
*   **Container Lifecycle:** The `--rm` flag indicates that the container will be automatically removed once it exits, signifying it's likely a temporary or development run.
*   **Environment Variables:** An environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is being passed into the container, taking its value from a host environment variable of the same name (`$AIPROXY_TOKEN`). This is crucial for authentication or API access within the containerized application.
*   **Port Mapping:** Host port `8000` is mapped to container port `8000` (`-p 8000:8000`), meaning the application running inside the container on port 8000 will be accessible from the host machine on its port 8000.
*   **Container Image:** The command refers to a container image identified by the hash `047fa151bf43`.
*   **Application Server:** The `INFO` messages confirm that `Uvicorn` is running the application. Uvicorn is a popular ASGI web server, commonly used for Python web frameworks like FastAPI or Starlette, often used in data science contexts to serve machine learning models as APIs.
*   **Application Status:** The application has successfully started and is listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` inside the container, which is accessible via `http://localhost:8000` (or the host's IP) from the host machine due to the port mapping.
*   **No Errors:** The entire output indicates a successful application startup without any errors.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43
INFO: Started server process [1]

The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,  
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07

My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

* **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We *may* pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures the output of an automated test or grading system, likely within a data science course, focused on data scraping and processing.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Successful Data Saving:**
    *   `HTTP 200 "Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json"`
    *   This indicates that a previous operation (likely data scraping) successfully completed and saved data to a JSON file named `b6.json` in the `./data/` directory. The `HTTP 200` status confirms success.

2.  **Successful Data Retrieval:**
    *   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
    *   This shows that the system then made an HTTP GET request to a local server (`localhost:8052`) to read the content of the `b6.json` file. This request also returned a `200 OK` status, meaning the file was successfully accessed and its content retrieved.

3.  **Test Comparison - Expected vs. Result:**
    *   The system is performing a comparison between an `EXPECTED` output and the `RESULT` obtained from the `b6.json` file.
    *   The test focuses on a list of author names.

4.  **The Mismatch and Failure:**
    *   The core issue is a discrepancy in the representation of a special character, specifically the 'é' in "André Gide".
    *   **The test (B6) ultimately `FAILED`**.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
HTTP 200 "Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json"
HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

/data/b6.json
! EXPECTED:
['Albert Einstein', 'J.K. Rowling', 'Albert Einstein', 'Jane Austen', 'Marilyn Monroe', 'Albert Einstein', 'André Gide', 'Thomas A. Edison', 'Eleanor Roosevelt', 'Steve Martin']
! RESULT:
[
  {
    ".author": [
      "Albert Einstein",
      "J.K. Rowling",
      "Albert Einstein",
      "Jane Austen",
      "Marilyn Monroe",
      "Albert Einstein",
      "Andr\u00e9 Gide",
      "Thomas A. Edison",
      "Eleanor Roosevelt",
      "Steve Martin"
    ]
  }
]

X B6 FAILED
```

**Detailed Analysis of the Mismatch:**

*   **EXPECTED Data:** The expected output is a simple Python list of strings. The name "André Gide" correctly shows the 'é' character.
*   **RESULT Data:** The actual result retrieved from `b6.json` is a JSON structure: an array containing an object with a key `".author"` whose value is an array of strings. Crucially, within this list, "André Gide" appears as `"Andr\u00e9 Gide"`.

The failure is caused by the difference in how "André Gide" is represented: the `EXPECTED` value has the character `é` directly, while the `RESULT` has its Unicode escape sequence `\u00e9`. This indicates a potential issue with character encoding during the scraping, saving, or reading process, where the `é` character was converted into its Unicode escape sequence in the JSON output, and the comparison expects the decoded character.*

*March 28, 2025, 20:59 UTC*
can you please take a look at this screenshot?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot details the execution and validation of a task within a data science course, likely involving an API and a Large Language Model (LLM). While the overall A7 assignment is marked "PASSED," a specific sub-check or test case within it has failed due to an incorrect output.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Overall Status:** The assignment "A7" is marked as "PASSED" with a green checkmark at the top. However, a critical error (red dot) is reported at the bottom, indicating a failure in the expected output. This suggests that the *execution* of the commands was successful from an HTTP perspective, but the *content* produced did not match the expectation.
2.  **Task Description:** The core task involves image processing with an LLM:
    *   **Input:** An image file located at `/data/card.jpg` which contains a credit card.
    *   **Process:** Pass this image to an LLM.
    *   **Output Goal:** Extract the credit card number from the image and write it *without spaces* to a file named `/data/cc-number.txt`.
3.  **Execution Flow:**
    *   **Step 1 (POST Request):** A `POST` request is sent to `http://localhost:8001/run` to initiate the task. The entire task description is URL-encoded and passed as a `task` parameter. This request receives a `200 OK` HTTP status.
    *   **Step 2 (LLM Confirmation):** The response body of the `POST` request indicates that "The task of extracting the card number from the image and writing it to `/data/cc-number.txt` has been completed successfully." This confirms the system believes the LLM performed its duty and wrote the file.
    *   **Step 3 (GET Request):** A subsequent `GET` request is made to `http://localhost:8001/read?path=/data/cc-number.txt` to read the content of the file that was supposed to be generated by the LLM. This request also receives a `200 OK` HTTP status, meaning the file was successfully read.
4.  **The Error/Discrepancy:** The content read from `/data/cc-number.txt` (the "RESULT") does not exactly match the "EXPECTED" value.
    *   **Expected Value:** `6011598665215965`
    *   **Result Value:** `6011598656215965`
    *   **Nature of Error:** The 9th and 10th digits are swapped. The expected `65` appears as `56` in the result.

! EXPECTED:
6011598665215965
! RESULT:
6011598656215965
```

---

### Expert Analysis:

The primary issue here is a subtle but critical data integrity error. Despite all API calls returning `200 OK` and the server reporting the task as "completed successfully," the extracted credit card number is incorrect.

**Possible Causes for the Digit Swap (65 -> 56):**

1.  **LLM Misinterpretation (Most Likely):** The LLM, when processing the `/data/card.jpg` image, likely made an optical character recognition (OCR) or semantic interpretation error, swapping these two adjacent digits. This is a common failure mode for AI models dealing with numerical data, especially when characters are visually similar or closely spaced.
2.  **Post-Processing Error:** Less likely, but possible: The LLM might have correctly extracted `6011598665215965`, but an intermediate script or function responsible for taking the LLM's raw output and writing it to `/data/cc-number.txt` introduced the swap. This could be due to a bug in parsing, string manipulation, or type conversion (e.g., if it temporarily converts to a number format that loses precision or reorders digits, then converts back to a string).
3.  **Data Corruption (Least Likely):** Extremely rare, but could be a transient issue if the file system or memory was corrupted during the write or read operation. Given it's a specific digit swap, this is highly improbable.

**Why "A7 PASSED" despite the error?**

This indicates a flaw in the testing or grading methodology. The "A7 PASSED" likely means that:
*   All required HTTP requests were made.
*   All HTTP requests returned successful (2xx) status codes.
*   The API endpoints (`/run`, `/read`) functioned as expected.

However, the "red dot" failure indicates that a subsequent, more granular validation step, which compares the actual *content* of the generated file with the expected content, failed. The overall "A7 PASSED" might reflect successful *execution* of the pipeline, while the detailed log shows a *semantic* error in the LLM's output. For a data science course, this would typically mean the assignment is *not* truly passed until the `RESULT` matches `EXPECTED`. The student would need to debug the LLM's prompt, fine-tuning, or the image processing steps to ensure accurate extraction.*



  
The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7**, **B8**, and **B10**, the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures the output of a system, likely a testing or task execution environment for a data science course, showing the execution and status of several tasks (B6, B7, B8).

---

### Key Information:

The screenshot displays the following:

1.  **Task B6 (Success): Web Scraping and JSON Export**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** A request is made to `http://localhost:8278/run` with a `task` parameter that is a URL-encoded description of a web scraping operation.
    *   **Task Description (decoded from URL):** The goal is to scrape authors' names from `https://quotes.toscrape.com/`, specifically from the first page, extract names from elements with the `author` class, and save them as an ordered array of strings to `/data/b6.json`. An example output format is provided: `['Douglas Adams', 'J.K. Rowling', ...]`.
    *   **HTTP 200 OK Response:** The system responds with a success status and the `generated_code` for the task.
    *   **Generated Python Code:** This code uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to perform the scraping and `json` to save the data. It includes basic error handling.
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** A subsequent request confirms the successful creation of `/data/b6.json`.
    *   **Task Status:** `B6 PASSED`.

2.  **Task B7 (Failure): Image Download and Resize**
    *   **Running Task Description:** The task involves downloading an image from `https://dummyimage.com/100x100/ad0434/ad0434.png`, resizing it to 50x50 pixels, and saving it to `/data/b7.png`.
    *   **Task Status:** `B7 failed:` and `B7 FAILED`. No specific error message or traceback is provided, only the general failure status.

3.  **Task B8 (Failure): String Formatting Error**
    *   **Task Status and Error Message:** `B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting`.
    *   **Task Status:** `B8 FAILED`. This error typically indicates a mismatch between format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `{}`, f-string placeholders) and the number or type of arguments provided for string formatting in Python or similar languages.

Sir even my evaluation log file is missing and I really don’t know what to do because during submission 8/10 of my A tasks were working. Please look into it sir. This is really going to affect my grade and I remember how hard I tried just to get my A tasks running. Please sir

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a message from a data science course forum, likely an automated notification or a direct message from an instructor/system regarding a submission's evaluation. The message indicates a critical issue with a student's Docker image submission.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Core Issue:**
The primary problem is that the "evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured." Users are invited to contact support if they believe this is an error.

**Score Implication:**
*   "MISSING files will result in a score of 0." The message explicitly states that the "Evaluation log file" is **MISSING**, which directly explains why the user received a zero score.

**Docker Image Requirements & Environment:**
*   **Responsiveness Timeout:** The submitted Docker image was expected to "become responsive in 5 minutes from launch." If it fails to do so, it is not considered. This strongly suggests a timeout occurred.
*   **Evaluation Environment:** The evaluation was conducted on a robust platform:
    *   **CPU:** "8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit."
    *   **Network:** "1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth," which is highlighted as "nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet."
    *   **Conclusion:** The message explicitly states that "performance of the server was not a bottleneck for your docker image," preempting user concerns about server-side performance limitations.

**Provided Files and Logs for Debugging/Review:**
The message lists several files/logs, indicating their purpose and availability:

1.  **Evaluation log file:**
    *   **Status:** **MISSING**
    *   **Purpose:** "This contains your performance report on your individual tasks." (Its absence is the reason for the 0 score).
2.  **Docker log file:**
    *   **Status:** Provided via Google Drive link.
    *   **Purpose:** "This provides the technical performance of your container."
    *   **Transcriped URL:** `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zn-ajY5yB1M1xxhraquPcPFNvqe7-ebC/view?usp=drivesdk`
3.  **Server start log file:**
    *   **Status:** "See attachment" (separate logs for ARM vs x86 architectures).
    *   **Purpose:** "If your docker service did not start or respond to attempts to our requests." This is crucial for diagnosing initial container failures.
4.  **Evaluation script file:**
    *   **Status:** "See attachment" (separate logs for ARM vs x86 architectures).
    *   **Purpose:** "This file has the actual tests that were run against your submission and the scoring mechanism." Useful for understanding how the submission was assessed.
5.  **Data generation file:**
    *   **Status:** "See attachment."
    *   **Purpose:** "The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks."
6.  **Docker orchestration file:**
    *   **Status:** "See attachment."
    *   **Purpose:** "This file handles the retrieval of your docker image from docker hub and launching of your container instance. It also sends the required environment variables that will be required by your container to function and the port mappings for communications." This file is key to understanding the deployment setup.
7.  **Solution script:**
    *   **Status:** "See attachment zip."
    *   **Purpose:** "This file solves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only. This is a sample example of what can be achieved by leveraging the core concepts of LLMs to achieve the desired result." This is not directly related to the evaluation failure but provides a reference solution.

**Specific Identifier:**
*   **Evaluated Docker Image ID:** `e1f186d9ce91` This ID uniquely identifies the specific Docker image that was evaluated.

**Overall Context:**
The message is providing detailed feedback to a student about a failed "Project 1" submission, likely involving a Dockerized solution for a task that might involve Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. The primary failure point is the Docker image's inability to start or become responsive, leading to missing evaluation logs and a zero score. The provided logs and files are intended to help the student debug their Docker image and understand the evaluation process.*

Hi [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

The contents of Expected and Result matches, but still test case’s failed.  
Is there formatting check for answer , Isn’t prettier to be done ?  
I see that your expected answer isn’t formatted using prettier , am i wrong ?

eg:

EXPECTED:

Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

> Hi [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

[@23f3003302](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f3003302) output from your server’s response is correct, we will update our evaluation script.

23f2004912:

> 

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the output of an automated test or validation process, likely from a data science course assignment named "B6," which has ultimately failed.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

*   **Initial Success:** The process began successfully. Data was "scraped" and saved to a file named `b6.json` in the `./data/` directory (indicated by `HTTP 200 "Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json"`).
*   **Data Retrieval:** The system then successfully made an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json` to read the contents of the `b6.json` file. This request also returned an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` status, meaning the file was accessible and read without a low-level error.
*   **Validation Check:** The core of the issue lies in a content validation step, comparing the `EXPECTED` data structure and values against the `RESULT` obtained from the `b6.json` file.
*   **Expected Output:** The test `EXPECTED` a flat Python list of strings, specifically names of authors.
*   **Actual Result (Discrepancy):** The `RESULT` obtained from `b6.json` is a JSON structure. It's a list containing a dictionary, and within that dictionary, there's a key `".author"` whose value is the list of author names. This is a structural mismatch from the `EXPECTED` flat list.
*   **Unicode/Character Detail:** Within the `RESULT`, the name "André Gide" is represented with a Unicode escape sequence `\u00e9` for the 'é' character, whereas in the `EXPECTED` output, it's the literal character `é`. While semantically the same, this difference in representation could contribute to a string comparison failure, though the primary failure cause is the structural difference.
*   **Overall Outcome:** The assignment "B6" failed the validation check, indicated by `B6 FAILED`.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
HTTP 200 "Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json"
HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

      "Thomas A. Edison",
      "Eleanor Roosevelt",

    ]
  }
]
X B6 FAILED
```*



[@23f2004912](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2004912) We will discuss internally if we can do something about it, but I can’t assure if you will get marks for it, since output from your server is a bit different.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an evaluation log file, likely from a data science course, hosted on Google Drive. The log details the execution and outcomes of several automated tasks. The primary issues observed are "file not found" errors leading to task failures.

### Key Information

1.  **Context:** The log is named `24f1002555@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`, indicating it's an evaluation report for a student from an IIT Madras (IITM) data science course. It's viewed within a web browser, specifically from Google Drive.
2.  **Task Failures (A7 & A8):**
    *   **Task A7:** Failed due to an inability to locate and read expected input files. Specifically, it reported "No such file or directory" for `/app./data/mail.txt` and a "404 Not Found" for `/data/mail-sender.txt` when attempting a GET request. This suggests an issue with the presence or path of a file related to email sending.
    *   **Task A8:** Failed to process an image (`/data/card.jpg`) to extract a credit card number using an LLM and write it to `/data/cc-number.txt`. The root cause was "No such file or directory" for the input image file (`./data/card.jpg`), leading to a "500 Internal Server Error" for the task execution and a subsequent "404 Not Found" when trying to read the expected output file.
3.  **Successful Task (Partial View):**
    *   A task involving finding the most similar pair of comments from `/data/comments.txt` using embeddings and writing the result to `/data/comments-similar.txt` appears to have initiated successfully. An initial `POST` request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returned `200 OK`, and the subsequent `POST` request to `localhost:8138/run` for this task also returned `200 OK`. The final outcome of this task's processing is not fully visible, but the command itself was received successfully.
4.  **Common Problem:** Both documented failures (A7 and A8) are attributed to "No such file or directory" errors, indicating missing input files or incorrect file paths required for the tasks to execute correctly.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a code viewer interface, likely a GitHub repository, for a project named "LLM-based-Automation-Agent". It provides a comprehensive view of a Python file (`app.py`), its structure, and related navigation.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Project Context:** The user is viewing the `app.py` file within the `LLM-based-Automation-Agent` GitHub repository, specifically on the `main` branch. This suggests a project focused on automation using Large Language Models (LLMs).
2.  **File Details:** The `app.py` file is quite substantial, consisting of `1284 lines` and having a size of `44.9 KB`.
3.  **File Navigation (Left Panel):**
    *   The current branch is `main`.
    *   Other files in the repository include `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock`. This indicates a Python project with potential Dockerization and dependency management.
    *   `app.py` is currently selected, highlighting its importance.
4.  **Code View (Center Panel):**
    *   The visible code is Python, utilizing decorators like `@app.get` and `@app.post`, which are common in web frameworks like FastAPI or Flask, suggesting this `app.py` file defines a web API.
    *   The code includes asynchronous functions (`async def`) and error handling using `HTTPException` with specific status codes (400, 404, 500) and `detail` messages.
    *   It performs file system operations (checking path existence, reading files) and includes a check for files being within a "data folder."
    *   The `start` endpoint provides a welcome message, while `read_file` allows reading file content and `run_task` is for executing tasks.
5.  **Symbols Panel (Right Panel):**
    *   This panel provides an overview of constants and functions defined within `app.py`, aiding in code navigation and understanding the application's capabilities.
    *   It shows constants related to "AI proxy" and "embeddings," reinforcing the LLM aspect of the project.

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86\_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

[@23f2001975](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2001975) we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python `KeyError` traceback, a common type of error encountered when a program tries to access an item in a dictionary (or dictionary-like object) using a key that does not exist.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Error Type:** `KeyError`
2.  **Missing Key:** `'AIPROXY_TOKEN'`
3.  **Location of Error in User Code:**
    *   **File:** `/app/app.py`
    *   **Line Number:** `30`
    *   **Context:** `in <module>` (meaning the error occurred at the top level of the script, not inside a function or class).

4.  **Problematic Line of Code:**
    The line of code that caused the error is:
    ```python
    AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIPROXY_TOKEN']
    ```
    This line attempts to retrieve the value of an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and assign it to a Python variable.

5.  **Underlying Cause (Internal Call Stack):**
    The traceback also shows an internal call to:
    *   **File:** `<frozen os>`
    *   **Line Number:** `716`
    *   **Function:** `in __getitem__`
    This indicates that the `KeyError` specifically occurred when the `os` module tried to access the requested environment variable, as the `__getitem__` method is invoked for dictionary-style lookups (e.g., `dictionary['key']`).

**Key Information for a Data Science Course Forum:**
The user's Python script `app.py` is trying to access an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` using `os.environ`. The `KeyError` indicates that this environment variable was **not set** in the environment where the script was executed.

**Exact Transcriptions:**

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 30, in <module>
    AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIPROXY_TOKEN']
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^
  File "<frozen os>", line 716, in __getitem__
KeyError: 'AIPROXY_TOKEN'
```*



This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this.

Thank you

@cartlon Same issue.

My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Can you please rerun the image on ARM based

You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python traceback indicating a `KeyError`.

---

**Key Information:**

*   **Error Type:** `KeyError`
*   **Error Message:** The key `'AIPROXY_TOKEN'` was not found.
*   **Location in User Code:** The error occurred in the file `/app/app.py` on line 30.
*   **Problematic Code Line:** The script attempted to access an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` using `os.environ['AIPROXY_TOKEN']`.
*   **Root Cause:** The program tried to retrieve an environment variable that was not set or accessible in its execution environment. The `os.environ` object behaves like a dictionary, and a `KeyError` is raised when trying to access a non-existent key.
*   **Highlight:** The red rectangle specifically highlights the environment variable name `'AIPROXY_TOKEN'` that the code is trying to retrieve, which is the missing key.

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

Kind regards

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

```
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

```

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY\_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log of operations and their outcomes from a data science course forum, likely related to an automated task execution system. The system attempts to run various tasks via HTTP POST requests and then read files via HTTP GET requests, encountering consistent errors.

### Key Information:

1.  **System Interface:** The system interacts via `http://localhost:8180` with two primary endpoints observed: `/run` for executing tasks (POST requests) and `/read` for reading file paths (GET requests).
2.  **Task Failures (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error):**
    *   Both attempts to run tasks (an "Install `uv` and run script" task and a "Format `/data/format.md`" task) fail with an `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error`.
    *   The error response body consistently provides `{"detail": "choices"}`. This specific detail string for a 500 error is unusual and may indicate a problem with internal task selection, configuration, or a specific application-level error.
3.  **File Read Failures (HTTP 404 Not Found):**
    *   Immediately following each `HTTP 500` error on the `/run` endpoint, the system attempts to `GET /data/format.md`.
    *   Both `GET` requests fail with `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found`, indicating that the file `/data/format.md` does not exist or is not accessible at that path when the read attempt is made.
    *   These `404` errors lead to explicit "Cannot read /data/format.md" failure messages for steps A1 and A2.
4.  **Sequence of Events:** The pattern suggests that the initial task execution (via `POST /run`) fails, and this failure likely prevents the creation or modification of `/data/format.md`, leading to the subsequent `404` error when the system tries to read it. The 500 error seems to be the primary blocker.
5.  **Specific Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1:** Installing `uv` and running a Python script hosted on GitHub Gist (`datagen.py`) with a specific argument.
    *   **Task 2:** Formatting a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using `prettier@3.4.2` in-place. This implies the file is expected to exist or be created for formatting.

### Transcriptions:

```

I encountered the same issue with `evaluate.py`. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with `evaluate.py`, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the output from a comparison or testing utility, likely within a data science or software development context, specifically for verifying text output or log content.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. File Source:**
The output is derived from or pertains to the file:
`/data/logs-latest.txt`
This suggests it's a recent log file or a text file being processed.

**2. Expected Output (`EXPECTED:`):**
This section shows the desired or correct text output, formatted across multiple lines. The content itself appears to be a sequence of seemingly random English words and phrases, possibly generated for testing purposes (e.g., to test text processing, string manipulation, or file I/O where the exact content isn't as important as its structure or presence).

**Transcription of `EXPECTED` content:**
```
Clearly drug health quickly field everyone majority as. Investment direction themselves suddenly.
West son we reflect. Size quite they new assume manager.
Official one draw various between time box goal. Wonder appear happen themselves. Include want key draw late list.
Hair hit rule employee.

Clear your upon sign. Type per task win.
Consumer beyond economy easy friend piece increase. With city write.
Matter statement last trial television. Not black owner most million answer. Toward contain girl member.
```

**3. Actual Result (`RESULT:`):**
This section shows the actual text output generated by the system or process being tested.

**Transcription of `RESULT` content:**
```
Clearly drug health quickly field everyone majority as. Investment direction themselves suddenly.West son we reflect. Size quite they new assume manager.Official one draw various between time box goal. Wonder appear happen themselves. Include want key draw late list.Hair hit rule employee.Option guess fish difficult our add. Bill practice main discover. Focus couple ball through network should leave.Within PM race former.

Type per task win.Consumer beyond economy easy friend piece increase. With city write.Matter statement last trial television. Not black owner most million answer. Toward contain girl member.
```

**4. Failure Status:**
`X A5 FAILED`
This clearly indicates that a test or assertion labeled "A5" has failed.

**Key Information & Analysis:**

*   **Test Type:** This appears to be a regression test or an integration test that compares a generated text output against a predefined expected output.
*   **The Discrepancy:** The crucial difference between `EXPECTED` and `RESULT` is the presence of **newline characters**.
    *   The `EXPECTED` output is structured into multiple distinct lines.
    *   The `RESULT` output is a single, continuous string where all the lines have been concatenated without any newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`) between them. For example, "suddenly.West" in `RESULT` instead of "suddenly.\nWest" as implied by `EXPECTED`.
*   **Reason for Failure:** The "A5 FAILED" message is almost certainly due to the absence of newline characters in the `RESULT` output. The test expects the text to be correctly formatted with line breaks, but the actual output has collapsed everything into one line.
*   **Potential Causes in a Data Science Context:**
    *   **File I/O Error:** The program might be reading data from a source (e.g., a text file, a stream) but failing to correctly interpret or preserve newline characters, or it might be writing to a file without including the necessary newlines.
    *   **String Manipulation Error:** A string processing function might have inadvertently removed or failed to add newline characters when combining or processing text segments.
    *   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:** If this text is part of a larger data structure that's being serialized and then deserialized, the process might be mishandling text with embedded newlines.
    *   **Environment Differences:** Less likely given the exact text, but sometimes cross-OS newline differences (`\n` vs `\r\n`) can cause such issues, though usually, it would just show mismatched characters rather than complete removal of newlines.

In summary, the screenshot indicates a test failure (`A5 FAILED`) where the program's output, sourced from `/data/logs-latest.txt`, did not match the expected multi-line format. The specific error is the omission of newline characters, causing the entire expected text to appear as a single, concatenated line in the actual result.*

Please, look over it.

Also, in my docker log file, it is showing the error as:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a log from a data science application, likely a web service using an LLM (Large Language Model) to perform tasks.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Application Startup & Server Info:**
*   The application starts a Uvicorn server, indicating a Python web framework (like FastAPI) is being used.
*   The server is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

**2. Task Initiation & LLM Interaction:**
*   A task named "Say Hello Carlton" is initiated.
*   The system interacts with an LLM, specifically `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`.
*   The LLM determines a "tool call" is needed. The tool/function suggested is `extract_specific_text_using_llm`.
*   The arguments proposed for this tool are:
    *   `input_file`: "system input.txt"
    *   `output_file`: "output.txt"
    *   `task`: "Say Hello Carlton"
*   The LLM response also includes token usage details: 83 prompt tokens, 1294 completion tokens, for a total of 1377 tokens.
*   A `costError` message `crypto.createHash is not a function` appears within the LLM's response block, which is unusual for a cost-related field and might indicate an issue with how cost is being processed or a malformed LLM response if this is a JS-related error in a Python context.

**3. Function Execution and Primary Error:**
*   The application attempts to call the function `extract_specific_text_using_llm` with the arguments identified by the LLM.
*   **Error Message 1 (Primary):** `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'`
    *   This is the core problem. The function `extract_specific_text_using_llm` tries to open `input_file_path` which resolves to `system_input.txt`, but this file does not exist at the expected location.
*   **Traceback 1:**
    *   `File "/app/main.py", line 121, in execute_function_call`
    *   `function_to_call(**function_args)`
    *   `File "/app/function_tasks.py", line 290, in extract_specific_text_using_llm`
    *   `with open(input_file_path, "r") as file:`

This traceback clearly shows that `main.py` called `execute_function_call`, which in turn called `extract_specific_text_using_llm` from `function_tasks.py`. The `FileNotFoundError` occurred when `extract_specific_text_using_llm` tried to open `system_input.txt`.

**4. Secondary Errors due to Exception Handling:**
*   The application attempts to handle the `FileNotFoundError`.
*   **Error Message 2 (HTTP Error):** `fastapi.exceptions.HTTPException: 500: Error executing function in execute_function_call: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'`
    *   This indicates that the `FileNotFoundError` was caught and translated into an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, which is then raised.
*   **Traceback 2 (during exception handling):**
    *   `File "/app/main.py", line 146, in run_task`
    *   `execute_function_call(tool["function"])`
    *   `File "/app/main.py", line 126, in execute_function_call`
    *   `raise HTTPException(status_code=500, fastapí.exceptions.HTTPException: 500: Error executing function in execute_function_call: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'`

This traceback shows that `run_task` called `execute_function_call`, and `execute_function_call` is where the `HTTPException` was explicitly raised after the initial `FileNotFoundError` occurred.

Yes, I agree.  
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?  
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.

Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.  
*" I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information `harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final latest d0f14a872042 5 weeks ago 214MB` "*

Also sir, could you please tell me why the error as shown in my previous message is being shown? and if there is no chance of it getting correct.

thanks

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

**Reactions:** 👍 1 ❤️ 1

Hi [@22f2001389](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f2001389)

```
  File "/app/app.py", line 4, in <module>
    from tasksA import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'

```

The error occurs because Python cannot find the `tasksA` module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.

Kind regards

> This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 468630ef32b8

We evaluated you on correct file



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum shows a user successfully pulling and verifying a Docker image in a terminal environment. The context appears to be an IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) study group or course, operating within a temporary Google BigQuery (or similar cloud) environment.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The user is operating within a command-line interface, indicated by the `usr_22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac_@tds-course-temp-bq:~$` prompt. This suggests a virtual machine or cloud-based environment likely provided for the course. The `tds-course-temp-bq` part of the hostname hints at "The Data Science Course" and potentially a temporary BigQuery setup.
2.  **Docker Image Management:** The primary activity is interacting with Docker.
    *   The user first executes a `docker pull` command to download a specific image.
    *   The `--platform arm64` flag indicates that the user is likely running on an ARM-based architecture (e.g., Apple M-series chips or ARM-based cloud servers) and needs the Docker image compiled for that specific platform. This is a common requirement in diverse computing environments.
    *   The image being pulled is `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`. This naming convention (`username/repository:tag`) is standard for Docker Hub. `rohit23f1001156` likely represents a student ID or project owner, `project1_tds` suggests it's related to "Project 1" for "The Data Science" course, and `v3` is the version tag.
3.  **Successful Download:** The output `Status: Downloaded newer image for rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` confirms that the Docker image was successfully fetched from `docker.io` (Docker Hub) and is now available locally. The "newer image" status implies it either updated an existing local image or simply means it's the latest version available.
4.  **Image Verification:** After pulling, the user uses `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"` to verify the image's presence and details. This is a good practice to confirm the previous operation.
    *   The output confirms the image `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` with tag `v3` is present.
    *   Its short Image ID is `468630ef32b8`.
    *   It was created `5 weeks ago`.
    *   Its size is `581MB`.
5.  **No Errors:** All commands executed successfully without any error messages.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, likely used for a Python-based data science project, with strong indications of Docker integration and virtual environment management.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Environment:**
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code.
*   **Operating System:** Windows, indicated by the PowerShell (`PS`) prompt and `C:\Users` path.
*   **Project Context:** A data science project, evidenced by Python files, dependency management (`requirements.txt`), and evaluation scripts.

**2. File Explorer (Left Panel):**
*   The project directory contains a mix of Python-related files, configuration files, and Docker-related files.
*   **Python Executables (likely from a virtual environment or system PATH):**
    *   `pip.exe`
    *   `pip3.13.exe`
    *   `pip3.exe`
    *   `python.exe`
    *   `pythonw.exe`
*   **Configuration Files:**
    *   `.gitignore`: Git version control ignore file.
    *   `pyvenv.cfg`: Configuration file for a Python virtual environment, confirming its use.
    *   `.dockerignore`: Docker ignore file, similar to `.gitignore` but for Docker builds.
    *   `.env`: A common file for environment variables.
*   **Python Scripts:**
    *   `app.py` (currently highlighted/selected)
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `tasksA.py`
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   `requirements.txt`: Specifies Python package dependencies for the project.
*   **Docker-related Files (indicating containerization):**
    *   `docker-compose.deb...` (partial name, likely `docker-compose.development.yml` or similar)
    *   `docker-compose.yml`
    *   `Dockerfile`
*   **VS Code Views:**
    *   `OUTLINE`
    *   `TIMELINE`

**3. Editor Area (Middle-Right):**
*   Only line numbers (17-22) and a single closing parenthesis `)` on line 20 are visible. No actual code content is discernible.

**4. Panels (Right and Bottom):**
*   **PROBLEMS Panel (Top Right):**
    *   Title: `PROBLEMS`
    *   Partial path shown: `C:\Users\Ri` (remainder is cut off). This indicates a problem detected in a file within the specified user directory, though the specific error message is not visible.
*   **Integrated Terminal (Bottom):**
    *   **Prompt:** `PS C:\Users\Ri>` (PowerShell prompt, partial user path)
    *   **Active Virtual Environment:** `(tds_roe)` (This is a crucial piece of information, showing that a Python virtual environment named `tds_roe` is currently activated in the terminal, which is best practice for dependency management in Python projects).
    *   **Partial Command/Suggestion:** `C` (being typed or as part of a suggestion)
    *   **Suggestion/History:** `* History` (likely showing command history or a suggestion for 'C')

**5. Status Bar (Bottom of VS Code):**
*   **Status Message:** `Python extension loading...` This indicates that the Python extension for VS Code is still initializing, which can sometimes affect IntelliSense, linting, or other Python-specific features.
*   **Problem Indicators:** While the PROBLEMS panel is open, the status bar shows 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 info messages in its immediate display area.

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.  
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY app.py /app

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

> **Image Content:** *This image is a popular programming/software development meme.

**Visuals:**
The image depicts an aerial view of a large stadium under construction. One side of the stadium's stands and roof appears largely completed and well-structured. However, a significant portion of the stadium on the right side shows red seating supported by an extensive and complex network of temporary metal scaffolding. This section clearly looks like a makeshift or temporary addition, not a permanent part of the core stadium structure. The background shows a city skyline.

**Transcribed Text:**
The following text is overlaid on the image in large, white capital letters with a black outline:
WHEN YOU CANNOT
REFACTOR THE CODE
BECAUSE OF
A TIGHT DEADLINE

**Key Information & Interpretation:**

*   **Core Message:** The meme uses the visual metaphor of the partially constructed stadium to represent the state of software code, particularly in projects facing strict deadlines.
*   **"Refactor the Code":** In software development (which includes data science, as it involves significant coding), refactoring refers to the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve non-functional attributes of the software, such as readability, maintainability, simplicity, extensibility, and performance. It's about cleaning up and improving the internal design of the code.
*   **"A Tight Deadline":** This phrase highlights a common real-world constraint in software development and data science projects. Under pressure to deliver quickly, developers often cut corners on code quality, design, and proper refactoring, leading to "technical debt."
*   **Visual Metaphor Explained:** The temporary, scaffolding-supported stadium section perfectly illustrates this "technical debt." It's functional (people can sit there for now), but it's not a permanent, well-engineered solution. It represents code that works but is messy, difficult to maintain, extend, or understand later, all because there wasn't time to build it properly (refactor).
*   **Relevance to Data Science Forum:** This meme is highly relevant to a data science course forum because data scientists frequently write, debug, and manage code for data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, model building, and deployment. It addresses common challenges faced by practitioners:
    *   The pressure of project deadlines often leads to suboptimal code.
    *   The importance (and frequent neglect) of code quality and maintainability in data science projects.
    *   The concept of "technical debt" – quick fixes and un-refactored code that will cost more time and effort in the long run.
    *   It serves as a humorous, relatable commentary on the realities of coding and project management in the field.

**Code/Commands/Error Messages:**
There are no specific code, commands, or error messages present in this image. It is a visual meme with overlaid conceptual text.*

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.
2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.
3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.
4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.

I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

Hi [@23f2002400](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2002400)

Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container.  
If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.

### Post #94 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (Course TA, ds-students)

That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.

Just look at docker\_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely showing the result of an automated test or a markdown file formatter. It presents a comparison between an "EXPECTED" output and an "RESULT" output, indicating a failure.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **File Being Tested:**
    *   `/data/format.md`: This indicates that a Markdown file named `format.md` located in the `/data/` directory is being processed or validated.

2.  **Test Status:**
    *   A red dot next to `/data/format.md` at the top, and a prominent red "X A2 FAILED" at the bottom, clearly indicate that the test or assignment (likely "A2") has failed.

3.  **EXPECTED Output:**
    *   This section shows the content the system was expecting to see, formatted in a human-readable Markdown structure:
        *   `# Header`: An H1 header.
        *   A Markdown table with specific column alignments:
            *   `| Start | Mid | End |` (Header row)
            *   `| :---- | --- | --: |` (Alignment row: `Start` is left-aligned, `Mid` is center-aligned, `End` is right-aligned)
            *   `| 1     | 2   | 3   |` (Data row)
        *   A paragraph of text: `Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace.`
        *   A Python code block:
            ```
            ```py
            print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")
            ```

4.  **RESULT Output:**
    *   This section shows the actual output generated by the system, presented as a single, raw string with explicit newline characters (`\n`) and escaped double quotes (`\"`).
    *   It represents the string that was produced, which did not exactly match the "EXPECTED" string.

5.  **Code/Commands/Error Messages Transcriptions:**

    *   **File Path:**
        `/data/format.md`

    *   **EXPECTED Content (as displayed):**
        ```
        # Header

        | Start | Mid | End |
        | :---- | --- | --: |
        | 1     | 2   | 3   |

        Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace.

        ```py
        print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")
        ```
        ```

    *   **RESULT Content (exact string):**
        `"# Header\n\n\n| Start | Mid | End |\n| :---- | --- | --: |\n| 1     | 2   | 3 |\n\nParagraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace.\n\n```py\nprint(\"23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\")\n```\n"`

    *   **Failure Message:**
        `A2 FAILED`

**Analysis of the Discrepancy:**

The core issue is a mismatch between the literal string output. The "EXPECTED" section displays the desired Markdown content visually, including blank lines for spacing. The "RESULT" is the raw string representation that was actually generated.

By comparing the `\n` characters, we can pinpoint potential differences:

*   **Header Spacing:**
    *   `EXPECTED`: `# Header` followed by two blank lines.
    *   `RESULT`: `"# Header\n\n\n"` (This indicates three newlines, meaning two blank lines, which matches the visual `EXPECTED`).
*   **Table Spacing:**
    *   `EXPECTED`: Table followed by one blank line.
    *   `RESULT`: `...| 3 |\n\nParagraph...` (This indicates two newlines, meaning one blank line, which matches the visual `EXPECTED`).
*   **Paragraph Spacing:**
    *   `EXPECTED`: Paragraph followed by one blank line.
    *   `RESULT`: `...whitespace.\n\n```py...` (This indicates two newlines, meaning one blank line, which matches the visual `EXPECTED`).
*   **Code Block Trailing Newlines:**
    *   `EXPECTED`: Code block seems to end with a blank line after the closing backticks.
    *   `RESULT`: `...in\")\n```\n"` (This indicates one newline after the closing backticks, which means no blank line after the code block, just a single newline to terminate the output string. This might be the source of failure if `EXPECTED` implied a *true* blank line after the code block, which would be `\n\n`).

The most likely cause for failure is a very precise comparison of whitespace and newline characters. The "RESULT" string includes all `\n` characters and escaped quotes as it was generated. The test expects this exact string output. Even a single extra or missing space or newline character, or an unescaped character where one is expected, would cause this "FAILED" status. Given the phrasing "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace," the test might also be checking for the *removal* or *preservation* of such whitespace in the processed output.*



  
This is the correct answer, eval script is not considering newlines properly. [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.

Additionally, my Docker image ID was **d2f27c03b878**, but the ID mentioned in the email was **dfac8596cd4c**. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.

I have also attached my Docker [log file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exrdQOCjbrCFux2hC4OQH_BfgiijCzD1/view?usp=drivesdk) for reference

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path\_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided traceback screenshot:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a Python `Traceback` indicating a `KeyError`. This error occurs when a program attempts to access an environment variable (or a dictionary key) that does not exist.

*   **Error Type:** `KeyError`
*   **Missing Key:** `'USER_EMAIL'`
*   **Origin of Error:** The error originates in the user's application code, specifically in the file `/app/main.py` at line 22.
*   **Problematic Code:** The line causing the error is `USER_EMAIL = os.environ["USER_EMAIL"]`. This means the program is trying to retrieve the value of an environment variable named `USER_EMAIL`, but this variable has not been set in the environment where the Uvicorn server is running.
*   **Execution Context:** The traceback shows that the application is being run by `uvicorn` (a fast ASGI server), which in turn uses `click` for command-line interface handling and `asyncio` for asynchronous operations. The `importlib` modules are also involved, indicating the error occurred during the loading or execution of the main application module.

To resolve this, the user needs to ensure that the `USER_EMAIL` environment variable is set before running the application (e.g., using `export USER_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"` in the shell, or configuring it in their deployment environment).

**Analysis of the Error:**

*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError`
*   **Error Message:** `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'`
*   **Location in User Code:** `File "/usr/src/app/app.py", line 22, in run_task`
*   **Problematic Line:** `action = classification.get("action", "").lower()`

This error means that the variable or object on which `.lower()` is called is `None`. Specifically, the expression `classification.get("action", "")` is returning `None` instead of a string (or an empty string as specified by the default value `""`).

This typically happens if:
1.  The `classification` object itself is `None` (e.g., `classification` was not properly initialized or assigned a value). In this case, `None.get(...)` would also raise an `AttributeError`, but it would be `NoneType object has no attribute 'get'`.
2.  More likely, the `classification` object is *not* a dictionary or a dictionary-like object that behaves as expected, or its `get` method, when called with `"action"`, explicitly returns `None` even if the default is provided (which is unusual for standard `dict.get`). The most common cause is that `classification` itself is `None`.

**Conclusion for the Forum:**
The user is experiencing recurring `500 Internal Server Errors` when calling the `/run` endpoint, regardless of the specific task. The root cause is consistently an `AttributeError` on line 22 of `app.py`. The `classification` object (or the result of `classification.get("action", "")`) is `None` when it's expected to be a string (or at least a non-None object with a `.lower()` method).

To resolve this, the user should examine `app.py` at line 22 and the code that initializes or populates the `classification` variable within the `run_task` function to ensure it's not `None` before attempting to call `.lower()` on the result of `classification.get(...)`. The `404 Not Found` errors for `/read` indicate a separate issue with that endpoint or the files it's trying to access.*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a console or terminal output, likely from an automated grading system or a local development server running a data science application. It indicates the results of a series of operations, some failing and some succeeding, leading to a partial score.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Primary Failure: File Not Found / Database Access Error:**
    *   The most prominent issue is an inability to access a specific data file.
    *   A JSON-formatted error explicitly states `"unable to open database file"`.
    *   This is corroborated by an `HTTP GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/b10.csv` which returned an `HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND` status. This indicates the server could not find the specified CSV file at that path.
    *   Further confirmation comes from the specific task "B10" failing with the message "Cannot read /data/b10.csv", strongly linking the database/file error to a specific problem or test case.

2.  **Automated Task/Test Failure:**
    *   The presence of "B10 failed" (with a red circle and a red cross emoji) suggests that "B10" represents a specific test case, assignment problem, or module that failed due to the inability to read the `/data/b10.csv` file.

3.  **Partial Score:**
    *   A score of `12 / 20` is displayed, indicating that while some parts of the system or solution might be working correctly, the failure of B10 (and potentially other unshown issues) has significantly impacted the overall result.

4.  **Successful API Call:**
    *   In contrast to the file access issues, an `HTTP POST` request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returned an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` status. This indicates that the application was able to successfully communicate with an external AI proxy (likely for OpenAI embeddings), suggesting network connectivity and external API integration are working correctly.

**In summary, the user's application or solution is struggling with local file access, specifically failing to read `/data/b10.csv` from a local server, which leads to a failed test case (B10) and a reduced score, despite successful interactions with external APIs.**

My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information:

The user is encountering an `OSError: cannot open resource` during the execution of a Python script, specifically when attempting to load font files using the `Pillow` (PIL fork) library's `ImageFont.truetype` function.

The problem manifests in two consecutive stages:

1.  **Initial Error:** The script first attempts to load `"arial.ttf"`. This fails with `OSError: cannot open resource`.
    *   The traceback indicates the error originates in `datagenmrt9km.py` at line 220, within the `a8_credit_card_image` function.
    *   The deeper layers of the traceback point to `PIL/ImageFont.py` (lines 879, 876, 284) and its internal `core.getfont()` method, which is responsible for opening the font file.

2.  **Subsequent Error (during exception handling):** While handling the first `OSError`, another identical exception occurs. This suggests the script has fallback logic or attempts to load a different font, which also fails.
    *   This second error occurs in the same `a8_credit_card_image` function, but this time at line 224, attempting to load `"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf"`.
    *   The fact that both distinct font paths (`"arial.ttf"` and `"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf"`) result in the same "cannot open resource" error strongly indicates a systemic issue:
        *   **Missing Fonts:** The required font files might not exist at the specified paths in the execution environment.
        *   **Permissions Issues:** The Python process might lack the necessary read permissions for the directories or font files.
        *   **Environment Configuration:** The environment where the script is running (possibly a Docker container, virtual machine, or remote server) might not have common system fonts installed or accessible.

The `INFO` message at the bottom provides context about how the script was initiated, showing a `POST /run` command that involves installing `uv` (a Python package installer/manager) and then running a script fetched from a GitHub Gist. This suggests the environment might be dynamically set up, and font dependencies might not be adequately covered by the `uv` setup or the Gist's script.

The overall context points to a data generation task involving credit card images (`a8_credit_card_image`), where text rendering (requiring fonts) is a critical step that is failing.

```*



The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a sequence of code lines, most likely Python function calls, from what appears to be a data science script or a set of exercises within a data science course.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Nature of Content:** The image shows nine lines of code, each representing a function call. The syntax (`function_name()`) is characteristic of many programming languages, with Python being a very strong candidate given its prevalence in data science and the naming conventions.
2.  **Sequential Naming Convention:** Each function name starts with an `a` followed by a number (a2, a3, ..., a10), then an underscore, and a descriptive word or phrase. This suggests a structured sequence, possibly:
    *   **Assignments/Activities:** `a` could stand for "assignment" or "activity," with each line representing a distinct task or sub-task within a larger project.
    *   **Pipeline Steps:** Each function might represent a step in a data processing pipeline.
3.  **Data Processing / Domain Focus:** The descriptive names provide strong clues about the type of data or processing involved:
    *   `format_markdown()`: Likely deals with text formatting, possibly for reports or documentation.
    *   `dates()`: Suggests operations on date and time data.
    *   `contacts()`: Implies handling contact information (names, addresses, etc.).
    *   `logs()`: Points to processing log files, which often contain event data.
    *   `docs()`: General document processing.
    *   `email()`: Operations related to email data.
    *   `credit_card_image()`: This is highly specific and interesting; it could involve image processing (e.g., OCR to extract numbers from an image of a credit card), or analysis related to credit card fraud, or even anonymization/redaction.
    *   `comments()`: Likely involves text analysis on user comments (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
    *   `ticket_sales()`: Indicates analysis of sales data, specifically for tickets (events, transportation, etc.).
4.  **Purpose within a Course:** Given the context of a "data science course forum," these lines most likely represent:
    *   Individual exercises students are expected to complete.
    *   Parts of a larger project assignment, where each function encapsulates a specific data task.
    *   Modules or functions provided by the course instructors for students to use or understand.
5.  **Missing Information:** The screenshot only shows function calls. It doesn't reveal the function definitions, their internal logic, parameters they might accept, their return values, or any output/errors from their execution.

### Transcribed Code/Commands:

```
a2_format_markdown()

a5_logs()
a6_docs()
a7_email()
a8_credit_card_image()
a9_comments()
a10_ticket_sales()
```*



  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you

> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot details a sequence of events related to a task execution, culminating in an error.

1.  **Task Initiation:** The system is attempting to perform a task which involves two main steps:
    *   Installing a tool/package named `uv` (if it's not already present).
    *   Running a Python script hosted on GitHub Gist. The script's URL is provided.
    *   The script is to be executed with a single argument, which appears to be a unique identifier or course-related ID (`23f3003196@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`).

2.  **Execution Mechanism:** This task is being initiated via an HTTP `POST` request to a local server endpoint (`http://localhost:8503/run`). The entire task description is URL-encoded and passed as the `task` query parameter in this request.

3.  **Immediate Error:** The `localhost` server responded with an `HTTP 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`. This indicates that something went wrong on the server-side while processing the request to run the task.

4.  **Root Cause of the Error:** The `HTTP 500` error was not due to an issue with the local server itself failing to process the request, but rather an issue it encountered when trying to execute the task. The detailed error message reveals that the local server (or an agent it uses) attempted to make a request to an external OpenAI API endpoint via a proxy (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions`) and received a `429 Client Error: Too Many Requests`. This means the external API is rate-limiting the requests, indicating that too many calls have been made from this source within a given timeframe.

**In summary:** The data science environment tried to run a script that likely uses an OpenAI API. This script, or the agent running it, hit an API rate limit on a proxy server, causing a "Too Many Requests" error, which in turn resulted in the local task execution failing with an `HTTP 500` internal server error.

this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20. [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

4.  **Output Details:** The output is a table displaying information about 9 Docker images, organized into five columns:
    *   **REPOSITORY:** The name of the image repository (e.g., `tds-project1`, `mish/myrepo`, `otialli0/tesseract`).
    *   **TAG:** The specific version or tag of the image (mostly `latest`, but also `23f3003027` for two entries).
    *   **IMAGE ID:** A unique identifier for the Docker image. Notably, `mish/myrepo` and `mishkat02/myrepo` share the same `IMAGE ID` (`07940877fae1`), indicating they are the same underlying image, possibly aliased or referenced from different local repositories.
    *   **CREATED:** How long ago the image was created or pulled. This ranges from "5 weeks ago" to "55 years ago" (the "55 years ago" is an unusual timestamp, often indicating a default epoch time or a very old image that has lost its proper metadata).
    *   **SIZE:** The disk space occupied by the image, ranging from 12.2MB to 2.33GB.
5.  **Context for Data Science:** The presence of images like `tesseract` (an OCR engine) suggests that the user might be working on projects involving optical character recognition, a common task in data science. The custom repositories (`tds-project1`, `mish/myrepo`) indicate local development, possibly related to course assignments or personal projects within a data science curriculum. The use of Docker itself is a fundamental skill taught in many data science programs for creating reproducible and portable environments.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) then why is the image id different?

in the docker hub as well as my local terminal the image id is 07b16dc68225

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Kind regards

Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK

```
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


```

Similarly for task B2.

```
INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?  
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build

```
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

```

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Checkin url: [Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub](https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25/commit/a71e3a84b284d7621f2a769308340454ebd58583)

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe\_open function that will throw a HTTP\_403\_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

Dear sir, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2 months back. I actually don’t know how this issues come in, please resolve this.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, displaying the prerequisites for "Project 1" and the results of an automated evaluation against those prerequisites for a student's submission.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Project 1 Prerequisites:** The project requires students to pass five key checks before their submission can be evaluated. These checks are:
    *   GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    *   GitHub repository contains a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
    *   GitHub repository contains a valid `Dockerfile`.
    *   Docker image is publicly accessible and can be run with a specified `podman run` command.
    *   Docker image uses the same `Dockerfile` as in the GitHub repository.

2.  **Evaluation Outcome:** The student's submission has largely **failed** the prerequisite checks, specifically concerning their GitHub repository.
    *   **Passed:** The Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public.
    *   **Failed:**
        *   The GitHub repository is either not present or not public.
        *   The `Dockerfile` is not present in the root of the GitHub repository.
        *   The MIT `LICENSE` file is not present at the root of the GitHub repository.

3.  **Consequence of Failure:** The text explicitly states that if these minimum requirements are not met, the submission will not be evaluated. The overall "Prerequisites" status is "FAIL," and the "Project 1 Score" is currently "0." This implies the student needs to address the failed prerequisites before their project will be further graded.

*March 31, 2025, 20:29 UTC*
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

Github repo link: [GitHub - karthiksirimilla/tds\_project1\_final](https://github.com/karthiksirimilla/tds_project1_final)

My evaluation.log , contains the score 6/20  
Roll no : 23f1002398  
Mailid: 23f1002398@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

My evaluation.log  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum, detailing key information and transcribing code, commands, and error messages:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays the output log from what appears to be an automated grading or task execution system for a data science assignment. The user attempted two tasks, B9 and B10, both of which failed.

1.  **B9 Task Failure:**
    *   The system attempted to retrieve a file named `b9.html` from the path `/data/b9.html` using a GET request to `http://localhost:8309/read`.
    *   This request resulted in an `HTTP 404 Not Found` error, indicating the file was not present at the specified location.
    *   Consequently, the "B9" task failed because the file could not be read.

2.  **B10 Task Failure:**
    *   The objective for Task B10 was to:
        *   Run a `datasette` server using the dataset `/data/ticket-sales.db` on port `8001` in the background.
        *   Query this `datasette` instance to count the number of rows where the `type` column is "Bronze" from the `tickets` table. The query URL specified was `http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze%22`.
        *   Save the result of this query to `/data/b10.csv`.
        *   Then, stop the `datasette` server.
    *   The attempt to execute this entire task (via a POST request to `http://localhost:8309/run`) resulted in an `HTTP 400 Bad Request`.
    *   The detailed error message reveals the root cause: a `HTTPConnectionPool` error with "Max retries exceeded" and an `[Errno 111] Connection refused` when trying to connect to `localhost:8001`. This strongly suggests that the `datasette` server, which was supposed to be started, either failed to launch correctly or was inaccessible on port `8001` when the query attempt was made.
    *   As a result of the failed `datasette` connection and query, the `/data/b10.csv` file was not created.
    *   A subsequent attempt to read `/data/b10.csv` also resulted in an `HTTP 404 Not Found` error, confirming the B10 task's failure.

3.  **Overall Score:**
    *   The user received a score of `6 / 20`, indicating significant issues with the completed tasks.

4.  **Final Request (Unrelated):**
    *   A successful POST request to an AI proxy for embeddings is shown at the end, which seems to be a separate operation from the B9/B10 tasks.

### Post #144 by **Sirimilla Karthik Balaji** (ds-students)
*March 31, 2025, 20:32 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email providing feedback on a student's "Project 1" submission for a data science course, specifically regarding the pre-requisite checks.

### Key Information:

1.  **Context:** The email is from an instructor or automated system to a student ("Dear Learner," "to me") providing evaluation results for "Project 1." The subject line appears to be "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores".
2.  **Prerequisite Requirements:** Project 1 has several mandatory pre-requisite checks that must be passed for the submission to be evaluated. These include:
    *   A public and accessible GitHub repository.
    *   A GitHub repository with an MIT license file.
    *   A GitHub repository with a valid Dockerfile.
    *   A Docker image that is publicly accessible, runnable via a `podman` command (specified below), and uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.
3.  **Evaluation Outcome:** The student *failed* the overall prerequisites.
4.  **Specific Reason for Failure:** The explicit reason for the failure is that the **Dockerfile was not present in the root of the GitHub repository.**
5.  **Successful Checks:** The student *did* successfully meet the requirements for:
    *   Docker image presence and public accessibility on Docker Hub.
    *   GitHub repository presence and public accessibility.
    *   MIT license file presence at the root of the GitHub repository.
6.  **Consequence of Failure:** Because the student failed the prerequisites, their "Project 1 Score" is **0**. The email explicitly states: "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

**Command for Running Docker Image (from Prerequisite 4):**
`podman run -e APROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

**Specific Failure Message from Evaluation:**
`Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL`

**Overall Prerequisite Status:**
`Prerequisites: FAIL`

**Project Score:**
`Project 1 Score: 0`*

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

Github repo link: [GitHub - karthiksirimilla/tds\_project1\_final](https://github.com/karthiksirimilla/tds_project1_final)

My evaluation.log , contains the score 6/20  
Roll no : 23f1002398  
Mailid: 23f1002398@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email providing feedback on "Project 1" for a data science course, likely titled "TDS Jan 25". The email details the prerequisite checks required for project evaluation and the results of these checks for a specific learner.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Context:**
*   **Source:** An email from a course platform, likely related to a "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores" notification.
*   **Purpose:** To inform a student ("Dear Learner") about the outcome of their Project 1 prerequisite evaluation.
*   **Outcome:** The learner has **FAILED** the prerequisites, resulting in a **Project 1 Score: 0**. This is explicitly stated to be due to the submission not being evaluated if minimum requirements are not met.

**Project 1 Prerequisites (Requirements for Evaluation):**
The email lists five specific prerequisites, which are common for data science/software projects involving containerization and version control:
1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
2.  GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
3.  GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile`.
4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman` with specific environment variables and port mapping.
5.  Docker image uses the same `Dockerfile` as in the GitHub repository.

**Prerequisite Evaluation Results:**
The email then provides the actual evaluation results for the learner:
*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** `PASS`
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** `PASS`
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** `FAIL`
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** `PASS`

**Key Failure Point:**
The critical issue leading to the score of 0 is the `FAIL` for "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo". This means the system could not find a `Dockerfile` in the expected location within the student's GitHub repository, or it was incorrectly named/formatted.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Command (from prerequisite #4):**
    ```
    podman run -e APROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
    ```

*   **Error/Failure Message (from evaluation results):**
    ```
    Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
    ```

**Summary of Status:**
*   **Prerequisites:** `FAIL`
*   **Project 1 Score:** `0`

**Additional Observations:**
*   The email is sent to "me".
*   The top bar shows the time "1:30", full Wi-Fi signal, full cellular signal, and 19 unread notifications.
*   The bottom bar shows 99+ unread mail messages and 8 chat messages.*

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

### Post #149 by **Carlton D'Silva** (Regular, ds-students)
*March 31, 2025, 21:01 UTC*
The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Kind regards

There might be some glitches in the system. Could you kindly verify the process again?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation message for "Project 1" within a data science course, sent from "22t1 se2002" to the learner. The message details the prerequisites for Project 1 and the results of the student's submission against these checks.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose of the Message:** To inform the learner about the results of their Project 1 prerequisite checks. Failure to meet these minimum requirements means the submission will not be evaluated further.
2.  **Project 1 Prerequisites:**
    *   **GitHub Repository:** Must exist and be publicly accessible.
    *   **LICENSE File:** GitHub repository must contain a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
    *   **Dockerfile:** GitHub repository must have a valid `Dockerfile`.
    *   **Docker Image Accessibility:** Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable using a specified `podman run` command.
    *   **Dockerfile Consistency:** The Docker image must be built using the same `Dockerfile` present in the GitHub repository.
3.  **Evaluation Results:**
    *   **Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** **PASS**
    *   **Github repo present AND public:** **FAIL**
    *   **Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** **FAIL**
    *   **MIT license present at root of github repo:** **FAIL**
4.  **Overall Outcome:**
    *   **Prerequisites:** **FAIL**
    *   **Project 1 Score:** **0**

**Analysis:**
The student successfully pushed their Docker image to Docker Hub and made it public. However, the critical failure points stem from their GitHub repository. The primary issue appears to be that their GitHub repository was either not found or not publicly accessible, which would then logically lead to the subsequent failures regarding the Dockerfile and MIT license not being found *in the repo's root*. This implies the automated system could not access or verify the contents of the GitHub repository.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Command:**
    `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

*   **Error Messages / Status Indicators:**
    `FAIL` (appears multiple times as a status for individual checks and the overall prerequisites)*



I’ve already received my score in the evaluation log. Additionally, the Docker Hub run logs show no errors, and both the GitHub repo and Docker image are publicly accessible. All the content has been verified and meets the prerequisites.

Let me know if any further action is needed from my end.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a data science course forum, likely displaying instructions for an assignment and the results of a student's attempt.

### Key Information:

1.  **Task Objective:** The core task involves interacting with a "Datasette Server" to perform a SQL query and save the output. Specifically, it instructs the user to:
    *   Start a `datasette` server, potentially in the background.
    *   Use `curl` to make a GET request to the Datasette server, executing a SQL query (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type='Bronze'`).
    *   Save the CSV output of this query to `/data/b10.csv`.
    *   Stop the Datasette server process.
    *   Crucially, the instructions emphasize ensuring `nuvx` and `datasette` are installed and that `/data` is a writable directory.

2.  **Instructions Provided:** The forum post provides detailed, step-by-step instructions, including exact `bash` commands for running `curl`, starting `datasette`, and killing processes (`kill $(jobs -p)` or `kill <PID>`). A combined example command is also given.

3.  **User's Attempt/Result:**
    *   **Failure Point (B10):** The primary issue is the `B10` component of the assignment failed. The error messages indicate that a subsequent process attempted to read `/data/b10.csv` via an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8064/read?path=/data/b10.csv` and received a "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" error. This led to the explicit failure message: "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv".
    *   **Possible Causes for Failure:** The `404 Not Found` suggests the file `b10.csv` was either not created at all, not created in the `/data` directory, or was created but not readable by the user/system checking it (e.g., permissions issues), or the checking mechanism itself is flawed or looking in the wrong place/port. The `curl` command's output (`-o /data/b10.csv`) is critical for this step's success.
    *   **Score:** The user achieved a score of `10 / 20`, indicating partial success on the overall assignment, but this specific `B10` component was a failure.
    *   **Other Activity:** A successful HTTP POST request to an AI proxy for embeddings is also shown (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`), which seems unrelated to the `B10` failure and might be part of a separate grading or submission mechanism.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

starting the server.\n\n### Step 2: Count rows
with SQL\n\n1. Use `curl` or a web browser to
make a request to the URL that runs the SQL
query. Replace `curl` with your choice of method
if necessary.\n\n If using `curl`, run the
following command:\n\n ``bash\n
curl \"http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?
sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22B
ronze%22\" -o /data/b10.csv\n ``\n\n This
command requests the CSV output of the SQL query
and saves it to `/data/b10.csv`.\n\n### Step 3:
Stop the Datasette Server\n\n1. If you are in a
terminal session and want to stop the server,
you can bring the server process to the
foreground with the `fg` command if needed, or
you can kill the process directly using:\n\n
``bash\n kill $(jobs -p)\n ``\n\n This
command will stop all background jobs started in
that terminal session. Alternatively, if you
know the PID of the Datasette server, you can
use:\n\n ``bash\n kill <PID>\n ``\n\n
Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID of
the Datasette server.\n\n### Summary of

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a series of automated checks and their outcomes, likely from a data science course assignment or grading system. The user's ID is `23f2005702@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

Here's a breakdown of the key information, with exact transcriptions:

**1. Initial Task Instruction / Context:**
The system is expecting the user's setup to perform a task involving a SQL query and data export.
*   **Instruction/Context:**
    ```
    Bronze%22
    and save it to /data/b10.csv.
    Then stop the datasette server.
    ```

**2. Datasette Task Attempt and Failure (Problem B10):**
The system attempts to run a `datasette` command to query a database and save results, but encounters an error. It then tries to read the expected output file, which is not found.

*   **HTTP Request 1 (POST) - Datasette Command Execution:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8462/run?task=Run+datasette+via+%60uv%60+datasette+%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales.db+--port+8001%60+in+the+background.%0AFrom+%60ticket-sales.csv%60+count+the+number+of+rows+where+%60type%60+%3D+%27Bronze%27+using%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8001%2Fticket-sales.csv%3Fsql%3DSELECT%252BCOUNT%2528%252A%2529%252BFROM%252Btickets%252BWHERE%252Btype%252B%253D%2527Bronze%2527%0Aand+save+it+to+%2Fdata%2Ffb10.csv.%0AThen+stop+the+datasette+server.%0A
    "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"
    ```
    *   **Error Detail:**
        ```
        HTTP 500 {
          "detail": "'choices'"
        }
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This POST request attempts to execute a command that would run `datasette` on `/data/ticket-sales.db` (presumably aliased as `ticket-sales.csv` via port 8001) in the background. It then attempts to run a SQL query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type = 'Bronze'` and save the output to `/data/fb10.csv`. The `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` with `detail: "'choices'"` indicates a server-side problem during this operation, preventing the command from completing successfully. Note the instruction mentions `/data/b10.csv` but the command tries to save to `/data/fb10.csv`. This discrepancy could be a typo or an intentional part of the problem.

*   **HTTP Request 2 (GET) - Verify File Existence:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8462/read?path=/data/b10.csv
    "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
    ```
    *   **Failure Message:**
        ```
        B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv
        X B10 FAILED
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This GET request attempts to read the file `/data/b10.csv`. Since the previous datasette command failed with a 500 error, it likely did not create this file. Consequently, the request returns `404 Not Found`, confirming the failure of "B10".

**3. Current Score:**
*   **Score:**
    ```
    Score: 1 / 20
    ```
    *   **Analysis:** The very low score indicates that most of the automated checks for this assignment or task have failed.

**4. OpenAI API Request and Rate Limiting:**
A separate issue is encountered when trying to interact with the OpenAI API.

*   **HTTP Request 3 (POST) - OpenAI Embeddings:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings
    "HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests"
    ```
    *   **Error Message:**
        ```
        Failed to send request to OpenAI API: 429
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This POST request is to an AI proxy endpoint for OpenAI embeddings. The `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` error signifies that the rate limit for this API (or the proxy) has been exceeded.

**5. Background Task Execution (uv and datagen.py):**
The system is also running a setup or data generation script.

*   **Running Task Description:**
    ```
    Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and
    run the script
    `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py`
    with `23f2005702@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` as the
    only argument
    ```
*   **HTTP Request 4 (POST) - Task Execution:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8064/run?task=%0AInstall+%60uv%60+%28if+required%29+and+run+the+script+%60https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsanand0%2Ff19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a%2Fraw%2F13246698088795e1942179856aafd46602b66ae%2Fdatagen.py%60%0Awith+%6023f2005702%40d
    ```
    *   **Analysis:** This section details a task to install `uv` (a Python package installer) and then execute a Python script named `datagen.py` downloaded from a GitHub Gist. The user's email (`23f2005702@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) is passed as an argument to this script. The second `HTTP Request` shows the actual `POST` command used to initiate this task on `localhost:8064/run`. There's no error explicitly shown immediately after this request, so it might be an ongoing process or successful, or its outcome is reflected later in the overall score.

**Summary of Problems:**

1.  **Datasette Query Failure (B10):** The primary failure seems to be related to running a `datasette` command to process and save data, resulting in a `500 Internal Server Error` and the subsequent failure to find the expected output file `/data/b10.csv`. The `detail: "'choices'"` in the 500 error is unusual and points to a specific internal server issue or malformed command.
2.  **OpenAI API Rate Limiting:** An attempt to use the OpenAI API resulted in a `429 Too Many Requests` error, indicating a temporary block due to exceeding usage limits.
3.  **Low Score:** These failures collectively lead to a very low score of 1 out of 20, indicating that the core objectives of the assignment were not met.*

*   **Project Score:** Consequently, the "Project 1 Score" is **0**.
*   **Specific Checks and Outcomes:**
    *   **Docker Image:** The most critical issue is that the Docker image is either **not present in Docker Hub or not public**, resulting in a **FAIL**. This is the sole reason for the overall prerequisite failure.
    *   **GitHub Repository:** The GitHub repository is **present and public**, which **PASSED**.
    *   **Dockerfile:** A `Dockerfile` is **present in the root of the GitHub repository**, which **PASSED**.
    *   **MIT License:** An MIT license is **present at the root of the GitHub repository**, which also **PASSED**.

**Conclusion:**
The student successfully completed most of the setup requirements, including creating a public GitHub repository with a Dockerfile and an MIT license. However, the failure to correctly push their Docker image to Docker Hub and/or make it public is the single point of failure preventing them from passing the project prerequisites and receiving a score above zero.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exact Text):**

These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL
Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS

Prerequisites: FAIL
Project 1 Score: 0*

Dear team,

The evaluation shows that the Github repo was not found, however the repository has published and public.  



> **Image Content:** *Based on the screenshot, here's a description of the key information and the exact transcription:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays the results of a "Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations" for a data science course or project. It outlines several critical checks required for project submission, assessing the presence and public accessibility of project components on Docker Hub and GitHub.

The evaluation indicates that:
*   A Docker image was successfully found on Docker Hub and is public (PASS).
*   However, the GitHub repository either isn't present or isn't public (FAIL).
*   A `Dockerfile` is missing from the root of the GitHub repository (FAIL).
*   An MIT license file is also missing from the root of the GitHub repository (FAIL).

Due to multiple failing prerequisites, the overall "Prerequisites" status is a FAIL, resulting in a "Project 1 Score" of 0. This implies that meeting these prerequisites is mandatory to receive any score for Project 1.

**Transcription:**

Respected Team,  
I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the automated prerequisite evaluation results for a student's "Project 1" in a data science course.

Here's the key information:

*   **Critical Evaluation Policy:** The top message clearly states that if a student fails to meet the minimum prerequisites, their submission will not be evaluated.
*   **Overall Prerequisite Status:** The student's submission has **FAILED** the overall prerequisites.
*   **Project Score:** As a direct consequence of failing the prerequisites, the "Project 1 Score" is **0**.
*   **Specific Evaluation Breakdown:**
    *   **Docker Image Status:** The primary reason for failure is that the "Docker image" is either "not present in dockerhub" or "not public". This check received a **FAIL**.
    *   **Github Repository Status:** The "Github repo" is "present AND public," which is a **PASS**.
    *   **Dockerfile Presence:** A "Dockerfile" is "present in root of github repo," which is a **PASS**.
    *   **MIT License Presence:** An "MIT license" is "present at root of github repo," which is a **PASS**.

The student needs to address the issue with their Docker image on Docker Hub (ensure it's pushed and set to public visibility) to have their project evaluated.

> **Image Content:** *The screenshot displays a single entry from a list or table, likely representing a project, repository, or container image within a data science development or hosting platform. It provides key metadata about this specific resource.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the key information:

*   **Column Headers:**
    *   `Name`: Identifies the name of the resource.
    *   `Last Pushed`: Indicates the last time the resource was updated or pushed. The upward arrow next to "Pushed" suggests the list is currently sorted by this column in ascending order.
    *   `Contains`: Describes the type of content the resource holds.
    *   `Visibility`: Specifies who can access the resource.
    *   `Scout`: This column's exact function is less common without platform context, but its value provides information about a specific feature related to the resource.

*   **Row Data:**
    *   **Name:** `coolsisters7/llm`
        *   This appears to be a user or organization name (`coolsisters7`) followed by a repository or project name (`llm`). The `/llm` strongly suggests it's related to Large Language Models.
    *   **Last Pushed:** `about 1 month ago`
        *   Indicates the resource was last updated approximately one month prior to the screenshot being taken.
    *   **Contains:** `IMAGE` (displayed as a pill-shaped tag)
        *   This is a critical piece of information, signifying that the resource is a container image (e.g., a Docker image), which is commonly used in data science for packaging environments, applications, or models.
    *   **Visibility:** `Public`
        *   The resource is publicly accessible, meaning anyone can view or pull it.
    *   **Scout:** `Inactive`
        *   A feature named "Scout" is currently inactive for this specific image. This could refer to a monitoring, indexing, or performance tracking service provided by the platform.*



  
Can Anyone explain what I did wrong ?

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation report for a student's submission to "Project 1" of a data science course.

Here's the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The report assesses whether a student has met the pre-requisite requirements for "Project 1". Failure to meet these minimum requirements results in the submission not being evaluated and receiving a score of 0.
2.  **Prerequisite Details:**
    *   The evaluation checks five specific items, detailed on a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.
    *   **GitHub Repository:** Must exist and be publicly accessible.
    *   **License:** Must have a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license in the GitHub repository.
    *   **Dockerfile:** Must have a valid `Dockerfile` in the GitHub repository.
    *   **Docker Image Accessibility & Runnability:** The Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable using a `podman` command.
    *   **Dockerfile Consistency:** The Docker image must be built from the same `Dockerfile` present in the GitHub repository.
3.  **Evaluation Results:**
    *   **Docker Image in Docker Hub & Public:** **FAIL** (This is the critical failure point).
    *   **GitHub Repo Present & Public:** PASS
    *   **Dockerfile Present in Root of GitHub Repo:** PASS
    *   **MIT License Present at Root of GitHub Repo:** PASS
4.  **Overall Status:**
    *   **Prerequisites:** FAIL
    *   **Project 1 Score:** 0 (due to prerequisite failure)
5.  **Conclusion:** The student has failed the prerequisites for Project 1 specifically because their Docker image is either not present on Docker Hub or is not publicly accessible. While their GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are correctly set up, the Docker image issue prevents the project from being evaluated.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Command (from requirement 4):**
    ```
    podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
    ```

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jayeshbansal) ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a file viewer interface, likely from a version control system like GitHub or a similar platform used in an academic setting, given the file content. It shows structured data in a table format, related to submissions for a data science course project.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Interface Context:** The top section shows tabs like "Preview," "Code," and "Blame," indicating it's a tool for viewing file contents, potentially a `.csv` or `.tsv` file, in different modes. The "Preview" tab is currently active, suggesting the system is rendering structured data.
2.  **File Statistics:** The file being viewed is named, but the name is not fully visible. It has `1069 lines (1069 loc)` and is `127 KB` in size, suggesting a moderately sized dataset or log.
3.  **Search Functionality:** A search bar is present and pre-filled, indicating a search was performed.
4.  **Course/Program Identification:** The email domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` strongly suggests this pertains to a Data Science study program at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).
5.  **Project Submission Data:** The table headers clearly indicate that the data being displayed is a record of project submissions, specifically for "Project 1."
6.  **Required Project Components:** For "Project 1," students are required to provide:
    *   A **Timestamp** of their submission/entry.
    *   Their **Email Address** (likely a student ID).
    *   A **GitHub repository link** where their code for Project 1 is hosted. This implies version control and code sharing are expected.
    *   The **name of a Docker image published on DockerHub**. This indicates that the project involves containerization and potentially deployment, a common practice in modern data science and MLOps.
7.  **Specific Entry Displayed:** One particular entry (row 1022) is fully visible, matching the email address in the search bar. This suggests the user specifically looked up this student's submission.

    *   `t` (keyboard shortcut hint)
    *   `+` (button to add new file/directory)
*   **Code Actions:** `Code` (Green button with download/clone options)

**Latest Commit Information (at the top of the file list):**
*   **Committer:** `PalakAnand30`
*   **Commit Message:** `Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE`
*   **Commit Hash (partial):** `ab381b5`
*   **Commit Age:** `2 months ago`
*   **Total Commits:** `5 Commits` (link to the commit history)

**File and Directory Listing (as of the latest commit):**
Each entry shows its name, the last commit message affecting it, and how long ago that commit occurred. All visible entries show "2 months ago", indicating they were last modified around the same time.

*   **`__pycache__`** (Folder icon)
    *   Last Commit Message: `Initial commit`
*   **`app`** (Folder icon)
    *   Last Commit Message: `committing final files`
*   **`.DS_Store`** (File icon)
    *   Last Commit Message: `committing final files`
*   **`Dockerfile`** (File icon)
    *   Last Commit Message: `Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile`
*   **`MIT LICENSE`** (File icon)

> **Image Content:** *Here's a detailed analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays an automated assessment or grading output for a data science course project, likely titled "Project 1". The assessment checks several critical prerequisites related to software development best practices, version control, and containerization.

The core information conveyed is that the project has *failed* its prerequisites, resulting in a score of 0 for "Project 1". The breakdown shows four specific checks:

1.  **Docker Image Status:** The project failed the check to determine if the Docker image is present on Docker Hub *and* is public. This is highlighted with a red circle, indicating it's the primary point of failure.
2.  **GitHub Repository Status:** The project *passed* the check confirming the GitHub repository is present and public.
3.  **Dockerfile Status:** The project *passed* the check for a `Dockerfile` being present in the root of the GitHub repository. The term "Dockerfile" is highlighted, possibly by the user.
4.  **MIT License Status:** The project *passed* the check for an MIT license being present at the root of the GitHub repository.

Despite passing three out of four checks, the failure of the first prerequisite (Docker image presence/public status) has led to an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" (underlined in red) and a final "Project 1 Score: 0". The "???" annotation on the right suggests user confusion or frustration regarding the zero score despite multiple passing conditions. This implies that all prerequisites must be met for the project to receive any score, or at least a passing score on the prerequisites.

**Transcription:**

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL
Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS

Prerequisites: FAIL
Project 1 Score: 0*



  
[

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a table or list from what appears to be a data science platform or forum, likely showing information about different data assets, commits, or projects.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Table Structure:** The screenshot presents data organized into three columns: "Last Pushed", "Contains", and "Visibility".
2.  **"Last Pushed" Column:** This column indicates the timestamp of the last activity or update for each entry. An upward arrow next to "Last Pushed" suggests the list might be sorted by this criterion, possibly in ascending order, or that it's an actionable sort button.
    *   The first entry was updated "about 2 hours ago" (highlighted by a red underline).
    *   The second entry was updated "2 months ago".
3.  **"Contains" Column:** This column describes the type of content associated with each entry.
    *   Both entries are listed as containing "IMAGE". This could mean they are image files, datasets of images, or perhaps models/notebooks related to images.
4.  **"Visibility" Column:** This column specifies the access level for each entry.
    *   Both entries are designated as "Public" (the first "Public" entry is highlighted by a red circle). This implies the content is accessible to everyone.
5.  **Context:** The terms "Last Pushed" and "Visibility" (Public) are common in version control systems (like Git, often integrated into data science platforms like Hugging Face, Kaggle, GitHub) or content sharing platforms where users can upload and manage datasets, models, or code. The "IMAGE" type suggests data related to computer vision or image processing. The red annotations likely point to specific information the user wants to draw attention to, perhaps related to recent activity or public accessibility.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository page, likely belonging to a student or participant in a data science course, given the context of a "data science course forum." It provides a clear overview of the repository's structure, recent activity, and its public status.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Repository Details:**

*   **Owner:** `Mayank8IITM`
*   **Repository Name:** `tds-trail-1`
*   **Visibility:** `Public` (This is explicitly circled in red, indicating the repository is publicly accessible.)
*   **Main Branch:** `main` (This is the default and only visible branch).
*   **Branches:** `1 Branch`
*   **Tags:** `0 Tags`
*   **Total Commits:** `10 Commits` (The latest commit shown is `6937764` from `2 months ago`).

**Navigation and Current View:**

*   The `Code` tab is currently active, showing the repository's file structure.
*   Other available tabs include `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Actions`, `Projects`, `Wiki`, `Security`, `Insights`, and `Settings`.

**Repository Contents (Files and Folders with Last Commit Messages and Age):**

The following files and folders are present in the `main` branch, along with their last commit messages and when they were last updated (all 2 months ago, indicating a period of inactivity or completion):

*   **`__pycache__`** (Folder)
    *   Last Commit: `Project is done 7/10`
*   **`data`** (Folder)
    *   Last Commit: `Project is done 7/10`
*   **`.dockerignore`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `updated dockerfile`
*   **`Dockerfile`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile` (This file is circled in red, suggesting it might be a focal point of discussion, perhaps related to Docker containerization.)
*   **`LICENSE`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `Create LICENSE` (This file is circled in red, indicating the project has a defined license.)
*   **`README.md`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `Create README.md` (This file is underlined in red, highlighting its presence, which is crucial for project documentation.)
*   **`datagen.py`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `A2 and A9 left`
*   **`evaluate.py`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `A2 and A9 left`
*   **`main.py`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `Project is done 7/10`
*   **`requirements.txt`** (File)
    *   Last Commit: `added dockerfile`

**Inferences relevant to a Data Science Course:**

*   The presence of `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and `requirements.txt` strongly suggests that this project is set up for **containerization with Docker**, a common practice in MLOps and reproducible data science environments.
*   Python scripts like `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `main.py` indicate a **Python-based project**, likely involving data processing, model training, or evaluation.
*   The `data` folder implies that the project handles or uses **data files**.
*   Commit messages like `Project is done 7/10` and `A2 and A9 left` sound like **progress updates or references to assignments** within an academic course context.
*   The `README.md` file is essential for documenting the project, which is a good practice taught in data science courses.
*   The `LICENSE` file indicates consideration for how the code can be used and shared, also relevant for collaborative or open-source projects.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations" report, likely from an automated grading system in a data science or software engineering course. It outlines the minimum requirements for a project submission to be evaluated.

**Key Information:**

*   **Overall Status:** The project submission has *failed* the prerequisites ("Prerequisites: FAIL") and, as a consequence, has received a "Project 1 Score: 0". The top line (partially visible) states: "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."
*   **Specific Evaluation Items:**
    *   **Docker Image:** The Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public (**PASS**). This requirement was met.
    *   **GitHub Repository Presence & Public Status:** The GitHub repository is *not* present AND public (**FAIL**). This is a critical failure, as subsequent checks might depend on repo access.
    *   **Dockerfile Presence:** A `Dockerfile` is *not* present in the root of the GitHub repository (**FAIL**). The term "Dockerfile" is highlighted.
    *   **MIT License Presence:** An `MIT license` file is *not* present at the root of the GitHub repository (**FAIL**).
*   **Implied Issues:** The user needs to ensure their GitHub repository is correctly set up as public and accessible, and that both the `Dockerfile` and `MIT license` files are located directly in its root directory.

**Transcription of Text (including highlighted elements):**

If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated.

These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL
Is <mark>Dockerfile</mark> present in root of github repo: FAIL
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL

Prerequisites: FAIL
Project 1 Score: 0

The task B6 was  
<https://quotes.toscrape.com/> has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author’s name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

Hi Course Team,

I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one is true?



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email from a data science course, "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores," providing a student with the results of their Project 1 prerequisite evaluation.

**Key Information:**

*   **Sender:** An entity identified as "22t1 se2002" (likely a student ID or automated system associated with the course) sent the email at 1:24 am.
*   **Recipient:** The email is addressed to the "Learner."
*   **Purpose:** The email informs the learner about their Project 1 prerequisite evaluation results. Failing these prerequisites means the submission will not be evaluated.
*   **Prerequisite Requirements:** The email lists five key checks required for Project 1:
    1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
    4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a specific `podman run` command.
    5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.
*   **Evaluation Results:**
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: **PASS**"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: **PASS**"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: **FAIL**"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: **PASS**"
*   **Overall Outcome:**
    *   "Prerequisites: **FAIL**" - Despite passing most checks, the failure of a single prerequisite (Dockerfile not in the root of the GitHub repo) resulted in an overall prerequisite failure.
    *   "Project 1 Score: **0**" - As a direct consequence of failing the prerequisites, the project received a score of 0, indicating it was not evaluated further.
*   **Course/Team:** The email is from the "TDS Team."

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

The command used for running the Docker image is:
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the results of an automated prerequisite evaluation for "Project 1" in a data science or software development course. It assesses four key criteria related to the student's project setup on Docker Hub and GitHub.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The evaluation aims to check if the student has fulfilled the necessary preliminary requirements for Project 1.
*   **Overall Status:** Three out of four prerequisites have been successfully met (PASS), but one crucial item has failed (FAIL).
*   **Successful Prerequisites:**
    *   The student's Docker image is correctly present and public on Docker Hub.
    *   The student's GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    *   An MIT license file is present at the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Failed Prerequisite:** The most critical piece of information is the **FAIL** status for the "Dockerfile present in root of github repo" check. This indicates that the automated system could not find a file named `Dockerfile` at the top level of the student's linked GitHub repository. This is the primary issue the student needs to address to proceed with Project 1.

**Transcription:**

These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS*



my dockerfile is available in github, Please look into the issue  
Thank you

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

I also have same issue, can you check this…

[Repo link](https://github.com/21f3001076/TDS_Project_1)



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot provides a comprehensive overview of a project repository, likely hosted on GitHub or a similar platform, indicating it's part of a data science course (given the "TDS Project 1" naming).

Here's the key information observed:

**1. Repository Context & Activity:**
*   **Current Branch:** `main` (visible in the top-left dropdown).
*   **Last Commit:** Made by user `lakshay654` `2 months ago`. This indicates the last activity on the project was a couple of months prior to the screenshot.
*   **Actions:** "Code" button (typically for cloning/downloading the repository) and an ellipsis menu (for more options) are present in the top-right.

**2. Project File Structure:**
The repository contains a standard set of files commonly found in Python-based development projects, particularly those designed for deployment or sharing:
*   `Dockerfile`: Indicates that the project is set up for containerization (e.g., using Docker), which is crucial for ensuring consistent environments and ease of deployment.
*   `LICENSE`: Specifies the project's licensing terms, identified as an `MIT license` in the lower section of the screen.
*   `README.md`: The main documentation file for the project, which is currently being viewed.
*   `app.py`: Likely the main entry point for the application, probably a Python web application or script.
*   `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries and their versions required for the project to run, essential for dependency management.
*   `task_handler.py`: A specific Python module, suggesting a modular design where task-related logic is encapsulated.

**3. Project Overview (from README.md):**
The `README.md` file (selected in the bottom panel) provides immediate insights into the project's purpose:
*   **Project Title:** `TDS Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent`
    *   "TDS Project 1" strongly suggests this is an assignment or core project for a course, potentially "The Data Science Project 1" or similar.
    *   "LLM-based Automation Agent" indicates the project's core functionality involves leveraging Large Language Models to build an automated agent, which is a highly relevant and contemporary topic in data science and AI.
*   **Key Section Heading:** `Create an API`
    *   This confirms that the automation agent's functionality is exposed via an Application Programming Interface, allowing other services or users to interact with it programmatically.

**4. Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are **no explicit code blocks, command-line inputs/outputs, or error messages** directly visible or transcribable in this screenshot. The screenshot primarily displays a file directory listing and a portion of a `README.md` file.*

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.

This situation is particularly disheartening—**seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.**

I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Kind regards

I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly

Respected Sir,  
I have submitted my project following all the guidelines and fulfilling all the prerequisites. My docker file is available publicly and it is present in the root directory of github repo, still the mail says that the file is missing and my score is zero. Can you please look into this issue



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a file listing, likely from a version control system interface (like GitHub or GitLab) within a data science course forum context. It provides an overview of key project files, their last commit messages/versions, and the time since their last modification.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Project Files:** The list shows several Python scripts and configuration files, indicative of a typical data science or machine learning project:
    *   `datagen.py`: A Python script likely responsible for generating or preparing data.
    *   `dockerfile`: Configuration file for Docker, used to define an environment for containerizing the application. This is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and consistent deployment of the data science solution.
    *   `evaluate.py`: A Python script for evaluating the performance or output of a model or task.
    *   `requirements.txt`: A text file listing all Python package dependencies and their versions. This ensures that the exact software environment can be recreated.
    *   `tasksA.py`: A Python script likely implementing a specific task or component, possibly "Task A" of a larger assignment or project.
    *   `tasksB.py`: A Python script for another specific task or component, "Task B," suggesting modularity or distinct processing steps.

2.  **Commit Messages/Versions:** The second column shows details about the last change to each file:
    *   Most files (`datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`) show "v1", which could represent a version tag, a common initial commit message for the first stable version, or simply "version 1".
    *   `requirements.txt` is at "v1.1", indicating it had a minor update after the initial "v1" baseline, likely to update or add a dependency.
    *   `dockerfile` has a specific commit message: "docker updatae". Note the typo "updatae" instead of "update", which is common in manual commit messages. This indicates a recent modification specifically related to the Docker configuration.

3.  **Last Modified Time:** All files are uniformly listed as modified "2 months ago". This suggests that this view captures a specific snapshot of the project at that time, or that no commits have occurred to any of these files in the last two months within this repository branch. This consistency could imply a release point, a completed assignment submission, or a period of project inactivity.

**In summary,** this screenshot presents a well-structured, containerized data science project using Python, with clear components for data handling, task execution, evaluation, and environment management, all managed under version control. The consistent timestamp suggests a stable or archived state from two months prior.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (from the screenshot):**

*   `datagen.py`
*   `dockerfile`
*   `evaluate.py`
*   `requirements.txt`
*   `tasksA.py`
*   `tasksB.py`
*   `v1`
*   `docker updatae`
*   `v1.1`
*   `2 months ago`*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation report for "Project 1" in a data science course, sent from "22t1 se2002" to the learner. The report details a series of critical pre-requisite checks related to GitHub repository setup and Docker image deployment. Failure to meet these minimum requirements results in the submission not being evaluated and receiving a score of zero.

**Key Information:**

*   **Sender and Context:** The message is from "22t1 se2002" (likely an automated system or course administrator) sent at 1:27 AM, indicating an automated or very early morning evaluation process for "Project 1".
*   **Purpose:** To inform the learner about their compliance with "Project 1" prerequisites, which are mandatory for the submission to be evaluated.
*   **Prerequisites:** Five specific checks are outlined:
    1.  A public and existing GitHub repository.
    2.  A `LICENSE` file with an MIT license in the GitHub repository.
    3.  A valid `Dockerfile` in the GitHub repository.
    4.  A public Docker image that can be run using a specific `podman` command, implying a functional containerized application.
    5.  The Docker image must be built from the `Dockerfile` present in the GitHub repository.
*   **Consequence of Failure:** Explicitly stated that if minimum requirements are not met, the submission "will not get evaluated," and the final project score will be 0.
*   **Evaluation Results (for this learner):**
    *   **Docker image:** Passed the check for being present in Docker Hub and public.
    *   **GitHub repository:** Failed the check for being present and public.
    *   **Dockerfile:** Failed the check for being present at the root of the GitHub repository.
    *   **MIT License:** Failed the check for being present at the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Overall Outcome:** The learner's submission failed the overall prerequisite checks, resulting in a "Project 1 Score: 0". The primary issues for this learner are related to the GitHub repository's accessibility and content (missing Dockerfile and MIT license).

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

**Command:**
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

**Evaluation Messages/Statuses:**
`Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS`
`Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL`
`Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL`
`Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL`

**Summary Statuses:**
`Prerequisites: FAIL`
`Project 1 Score: 0`*

**Key Information:**

This email, sent on **Mar 29, 2025, 12:17 AM (3 days ago)**, is from "22t1 se2002" to the recipient, a "Learner," regarding the evaluation of their **project 1 docker image submission**.

The core message is that the Docker image submission has been evaluated, and the results are presented. A significant point is that **"MISSING" indicates that a file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured**, leading to a **score of 0** for MISSING files.

The evaluation environment specifications are also mentioned:
*   Docker images were expected to become responsive within 5 minutes from launch. If not, they were not considered.
*   Images were run on an **8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit**.
*   Each docker image had **1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth**, which is noted as being nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet.

The email then provides a list of files related to the evaluation:

1.  **Evaluation log file:** Stated as `MISSING`. This file was supposed to contain the performance report on individual tasks.
2.  **Docker log file:** A Google Drive link is provided for this, which gives the technical performance of the container.
3.  **Server start log file:** (See attachment) Separate logs for arm vs x86 architectures, indicating whether the docker service started or responded to requests.
4.  **Evaluation script file:** (See attachment) Separate logs for arm vs x86, containing the actual tests run against the submission and the `scoring` mechanism.
5.  **Data generation file:** (See attachment) This file depends on the evaluation script file to create data for tasks.
6.  **Docker orchestration file:** (See attachment) This file handles the retrieval of the Docker image from Docker hub and launching the container instance, including sending environment variables and port mappings.
7.  **Solution script:** (See attachment zip) This file solves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only, serving as a sample of what can be achieved by leveraging LLM concepts.

The ID of the evaluated docker image is provided.

Finally, the email clarifies that the current `scores` are **not final**. Learners have an opportunity to report any problems or discrepancies (e.g., bugs in evaluation scripts) until **Tuesday**. After this deadline, the `score` will be considered final. The instructors will also review the highest `scores` (including the `score` of the sample script) to normalize the rest of the `scores`. The sender apologizes for the delay in providing the evaluation results.

Got a email stating that prereq failed stating below..  
Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL

but i can see that image is public as shown below image.. am i missing something..



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a single entry from what appears to be a list or table of projects, repositories, or assets, likely from a platform used in a data science course (e.g., GitHub, Docker Hub, or a course submission system). It provides the following details for one specific item:

1.  **Name:** `rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25`. This is the unique identifier for the item. The format `username/project-name` is common on platforms like GitHub or Docker Hub. `tds-project1-jan25` likely refers to "The Data Science Project 1" related to "January 25".
2.  **Last Pushed:** `2 days ago`. This indicates the last time an update or push was made to this project or asset.
3.  **Contains:** `IMAGE`. This label, presented as a gray pill, signifies that the project or repository contains an "image." In a data science context, this most commonly refers to a Docker image or a container image, which packages an application, its dependencies, and the environment. This suggests the project might be a containerized data science application or environment.
4.  **Visibility:** `Public`. This indicates that the project or asset is publicly accessible and viewable by anyone.

In summary, this screenshot shows a public, recently updated container image (likely a Docker image) submitted or managed by a user named `rsjay1976` for "The Data Science Project 1" with a January 25 identifier.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no visible code snippets, command-line instructions, or error messages present in this screenshot. The information displayed is tabular data describing a project entry.*

Given that you noticed an error on our side, you could have informed us about the same. However, you made your changes 22 hours ago, which is not acceptable.

```

Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a public GitHub repository named `tds_project-1`, likely associated with a data science course (given the "tds" prefix and the "submission" commit messages).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Repository Overview:**
*   **Repository Name:** `tds_project-1`
*   **Visibility:** `Public`
*   **Branch:** Currently on the `main` branch.
*   **Branches Count:** `1 Branch`
*   **Tags Count:** `0 Tags`
*   **Total Commits:** `6 Commits` (The latest commit `c61a6ef` was made "now").

**File and Folder Structure with Latest Commit Information:**

The repository contains the following files and folders, along with their last commit messages and when they were last updated:

| Item              | Type   | Last Commit Message         | Last Updated Time |
| :---------------- | :----- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |
| `22f3000585`      | Commit | `Create LICENSE`            | `now`             |
| `__pycache__`     | Folder | `Final Submission`          | `2 months ago`    |
| `venv`            | Folder | `First submission`          | `2 months ago`    |
| `Dockerfile`      | File   | `First submission`          | `2 months ago`    |
| `LICENSE`         | File   | `Create LICENSE`            | `now`             |
| `MIT LICENSE`     | File   | `Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE` | `2 months ago`    |
| `app.py`          | File   | `Final Submission`          | `2 months ago`    |
| `requirements.txt` | File   | `First submission`          | `2 months ago`    |
| `test.txt`        | File   | `First submission`          | `2 months ago`    |

**Analysis and Observations:**

*   **Project Type:** The presence of `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `__pycache__`, and `venv` strongly indicates this is a Python-based project.
*   **Containerization:** The `Dockerfile` suggests the project is set up for containerization (e.g., with Docker), which is common for reproducible data science environments.
*   **Development Stages:**
    *   Many files (`__pycache__`, `venv`, `Dockerfile`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `test.txt`) show "First submission" or "Final Submission" commit messages from "2 months ago." This suggests a period of active development or submission around that time.
    *   The `MIT LICENSE` file was involved in a "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE" commit 2 months ago.
    *   The most recent activity, happening "now", is the `Create LICENSE` commit, which created/updated the `LICENSE` file. This indicates a very recent modification to the repository's licensing information, potentially overriding or complementing the previous `MIT LICENSE` file.
*   **Virtual Environment:** The `venv` folder is a standard Python virtual environment, typically used to manage project-specific dependencies.
*   **Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` is where the project's Python dependencies are listed.
*   **Main Application:** `app.py` is likely the main application script for the data science project.
*   **Testing/Data:** `test.txt` could be a placeholder for test data, unit tests, or general notes.

**Code/Commands/Error Messages:**
There are no explicit code, commands, or error messages visible in this screenshot. The transcribed text primarily consists of file names, folder names, commit messages, and timestamps as they appear in the GitHub interface.*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated prerequisite evaluation report for "Project 1" in what appears to be a data science or software development course. The report indicates whether essential components of the project submission meet minimum requirements.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Overall Status:** The submission **failed** the prerequisite evaluations ("Prerequisites: FAIL").
2.  **Consequence of Failure:** As stated at the top, failing to meet minimum requirements means the "submission will not get evaluated." This is reinforced by the "Project 1 Score: 0" at the bottom, indicating the actual project content was not assessed due to the unmet prerequisites.
3.  **Successful Prerequisites:**
    *   A Docker image was found on Docker Hub and is public.
    *   A GitHub repository was found and is public.
    *   A `Dockerfile` was present in the root of the GitHub repository.
4.  **Point of Failure:** The sole reason for the overall failure is the absence of an **MIT license file** in the root directory of the GitHub repository ("Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"). All other checks passed.
5.  **Actionable Insight:** The student needs to add an MIT license file to the root of their GitHub repository to pass the prerequisites and have their project evaluated.

**Transcription of Text (Code, Commands, Error Messages):**

```
If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated.

These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL

Prerequisites: FAIL
Project 1 Score: 0
```*



Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Can you also clarify my issue?

My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log.  
You can check the details in the images below. Screenshot of mail and repository

Roll no. : 21f3001076

[GitHub Repo link](https://github.com/21f3001076/TDS_Project_1)



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information:

This screenshot displays an automated or checklist-based evaluation of prerequisites for "Project 1" in a data science course. The overall result indicates a complete failure to meet these prerequisites, leading to a score of zero for the project.

**The student has met only one of the required conditions, but failed three critical ones, which collectively caused the entire prerequisite check to fail.**

**Successful Condition:**
*   **Docker Image on Docker Hub:** The student successfully pushed their Docker image to Docker Hub and made it public.

**Failed Conditions (critical issues that need to be addressed):**
1.  **GitHub Repository Accessibility:** The GitHub repository is either not present at the expected location or, more likely, is set to private when it needs to be public. This is often a blocking issue for further automated checks.
2.  **Missing Dockerfile:** A `Dockerfile` is not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository. This file is essential for defining how a Docker image is built.
3.  **Missing MIT License:** An `MIT license` file is not present in the root directory of the GitHub repository. This is a common requirement for open-source projects, indicating the terms under which the code can be used.

**Overall Outcome:**
*   All prerequisites are marked as "FAIL."
*   The student's score for Project 1 is 0, indicating that passing the prerequisites is a gating factor for earning any points on the project.

### Transcription:

```
These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

***However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.***



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum details the various files and logs provided to students to understand the evaluation process and troubleshoot their project submissions, particularly those involving Docker containers and Large Language Models (LLMs). It appears to be a breakdown of diagnostic and informational resources for a project (likely "Project 1") that has undergone automated evaluation.

---

### Key Information:

The forum post provides a comprehensive list of resources related to the automated evaluation of a student's project submission. These resources are categorized as follows:

1.  **Performance Reports:**
    *   **Evaluation log file:** Contains a performance report on the student's individual tasks.
    *   **Docker log file:** Provides technical performance details of the submitted Docker container.

2.  **Debugging & Troubleshooting Files:**
    *   **Server start log file:** Crucial for diagnosing issues if the Docker service failed to start or respond to requests. Separate logs are provided for `arm` and `x86` architectures.
    *   **Evaluation script file:** Reveals the actual tests executed against the submission and explains the scoring mechanism. Separate logs are provided for `arm` and `x86` architectures.
    *   **Data generation file:** This file is essential as the evaluation process relies on it to create the data used for the tasks.
    *   **Docker orchestration file:** Describes how the student's Docker image is pulled from Docker Hub, how the container instance is launched, and how environment variables and port mappings are handled during the evaluation.

3.  **Sample Solution:**
    *   **Solution script:** A complete sample solution for "Project 1" (the project being evaluated), which exclusively uses prompt engineering techniques. This serves as an example of what can be achieved by applying core LLM concepts.

4.  **Evaluation Environment Detail:**
    *   The preamble mentions a compute environment "nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet," indicating a high-performance evaluation setup.
    *   The specific ID of the Docker image that was evaluated is provided for precise identification.

Most files are provided as attachments, while the primary evaluation and Docker logs are accessible via Google Drive links.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

The screenshot primarily contains descriptive text and URLs, not specific code snippets, commands, or error messages. However, the URLs and the Docker image ID are exact values that should be transcribed:

*   **Evaluation log file URL:**
    `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYe44D8gieDOLu9dCrKdsKwVAQ7i_C-N/view?usp=drivesdk`
*   **Docker log file URL:**
    `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VTVeD-lwg3CFPFUYAcUqNzaGD7MlzyeC/view?usp=drivesdk`
*   **Docker image ID:**
    `11aa22fc1545`*



But here’s the catch:\*\* Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:\*

* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
* Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
* Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
* Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
* **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP**, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents**, and it would do that for you—without **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as a **terminal version of** [OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/).

---

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

## To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29**, **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0**—since it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

*April 01, 2025, 16:15 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated or manual evaluation report for "Project 1" prerequisites, likely from a data science course or platform. The overall outcome is that the submission failed the prerequisites and will not be evaluated, resulting in a score of zero.

The report details several checks, indicating which ones passed and which failed. The critical issue identified is the absence of a `Dockerfile` in the root of the GitHub repository.

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** Evaluation of prerequisites for "Project 1".
*   **Overall Status:** The submission **will not get evaluated** because it **failed** the prerequisites.
*   **Final Score:** **Project 1 Score: 0**.
*   **Passed Prerequisites:**
    *   Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public.
    *   GitHub repository is present and public.
    *   MIT license is present at the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Failed Prerequisite (The problem):**
    *   `Dockerfile` is **not** present in the root of the GitHub repository. This single failure caused the overall prerequisite evaluation to fail.
*   **Sender:** The evaluation was sent by the "TDS Team" (likely "The Data Science Team").

Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks

There is no Dockerfile in the root directory of your GitHub repository. The standard naming convention for a Dockerfile is Dockerfile.

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Hi [@thinkmachine](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/thinkmachine)  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj).

[@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.

Once again, thank you both!

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/lakshaygarg654)

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

### Post #223 by **Aryan Tikam** (ds-students)
*April 02, 2025, 18:26 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response, likely from an API call related to a data science application, specifically one interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM).

**Key Information:**

1.  **HTTP Status Code:** The primary error indicated is `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`. This means the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
2.  **Top-level Error Message:** The general error message provided is `"Internal server error"`.
3.  **Detailed Breakdown (`"details"` field):**
    *   The server was attempting to perform a "Task handling error" related to getting an "LLM response".
    *   It "Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts", suggesting retry logic was implemented but ultimately failed.
    *   The root cause of the failure is a nested `Error code: 401`. This is an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error, meaning the request lacked valid authentication credentials for the LLM service.
    *   Further details within the 401 error:
        *   `'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.'` This is the critical piece of information, indicating that the token used by the server to authenticate with the LLM is problematic because its source (issuer) is not recognized or trusted.
        *   `'type': 'invalid_request_error'`
        *   `'code': 'invalid_issuer'` This specific error code confirms the problem lies with the authenticity or validity of the token's origin.

**In summary:** While the user received an HTTP 500 error from their application, the underlying issue is an authentication failure (HTTP 401) when the application tried to communicate with an LLM. The authentication token supplied by the application to the LLM service was rejected because it was not issued by a recognized authority. This suggests a misconfiguration of the LLM API key/token within the application's environment.

**Transcription of the Error Message:**

```
HTTP 500 {
  "details": "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}",
  "error": "Internal server error"
}
```*



  
Can anyone explain what errors of this sort mean?

You have to show which task triggered this error. Is it all of them or only one of them. Only then we can diagnose what the problem is.

### Post #225 by **Aryan Tikam** (ds-students)
*April 03, 2025, 03:32 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a console log from what appears to be an automated task or assessment within a data science course environment. The primary issue is a series of failed HTTP requests, ultimately preventing a file operation and causing a specific task ("A2") to fail.

Here's the key information, including exact transcriptions of code, commands, and error messages:

---

### Key Information & Analysis:

1.  **Intended Operation:** The system was attempting to run a task to format the file `/data/format.md` using `prettier` version `3.4.2` in-place. This suggests a code formatting or linting step common in development workflows.

2.  **First Failure Point (Task Execution):**
    *   A `POST` request to `http://localhost:8365/run` (likely an internal service for executing tasks) failed with an `HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`.
    *   The detailed error message reveals the root cause: The server failed to obtain a response from an **LLM (Large Language Model)** service after 3 attempts. The LLM service itself returned an `Error code: 401`.
    *   The specific reason for the 401 error is an **authentication issue**: "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer." This indicates that the environment's credentials for interacting with an external (or internal) LLM API are invalid or misconfigured. This is the core problem preventing the task from proceeding.

3.  **Second Failure Point (File Read):**
    *   Following the initial task failure, a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8365/read?path=/data/format.md` was attempted, likely to verify or retrieve the file after the (failed) formatting.
    *   This request also failed, returning an `HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST`. This implies the request to read the file itself was malformed or invalid in some way from the server's perspective, or the server had another internal reason for deeming the request "bad" (e.g., perhaps related to the earlier LLM auth failure, making file access impossible).
    *   The user-facing error message confirms this: "Cannot read /data/format.md".

4.  **Overall Outcome:** The task labeled "A2" has definitively failed, likely due to the inability to format the file, which in turn was caused by the LLM authentication issue.

---

### Transcriptions:

*   **Initial Task Message:**
    ```
    Running task: Format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` in-place
    ```

*   **HTTP POST Request & 500 Error:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8365/run?task=Format%20%2Fdata%2Fformat.md%20with%20prettier%403.4.2%20in-place "HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR"
    ```

*   **Detailed HTTP 500 Error (JSON-like):**
    ```
    HTTP 500 {
    "details": "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}}",
    "error": "Internal server error"
    }
    ```

*   **HTTP GET Request & 400 Error:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8365/read?path=/data/format.md "HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST"
    ```

*   **User-Facing Failure Messages:**
    ```
    A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md
    X A2 FAILED
    ```*



  
Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.

### Post #237 by **Carlton D'Silva** (Regular, ds-students)
*April 03, 2025, 06:51 UTC*
We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

    *   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
    *   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Overall Status:** "Prerequisites: FAIL"
*   **Actionable Insight:** The learner successfully pushed their Docker image to Docker Hub and made it public. However, they failed three critical GitHub-related prerequisites: their GitHub repository was not public, they were missing a `Dockerfile` in the root of their repository, and they were missing an MIT `LICENSE` file in the root of their repository. This overall failure means their Project 1 submission will not be graded.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

The following command is provided as an example for how the Docker image should run:

```
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
```

The evaluation results are presented as:

*   Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
*   Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL
*   Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
*   Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL
*   Prerequisites: FAIL*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation or feedback for "Project 1" in a data science course, detailing whether the submitted project meets its prerequisites.

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The project requires a Docker image and a GitHub repository, with specific conditions for both. The evaluation is automated, checking for compliance.
*   **Prerequisite for Evaluation:** The submission *must* meet minimum requirements, otherwise, it "will not get evaluated."
*   **Project 1 Evaluation Summary:**
    *   The student's "Project 1" ultimately **failed** its prerequisites, resulting in a "Project 1 Score: 0."
*   **Specific Prerequisite Checks and Outcomes:**
    *   **Failed:** The most critical failure point is that the "Docker image" is either "not present in dockerhub" or "not public." This single failure caused the overall prerequisite failure.
    *   **Passed:**
        *   The "Github repo" is present and public.
        *   The "Dockerfile" is present in the root of the GitHub repository.
        *   The "MIT license" is present at the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Running Environment/Command:** The project is expected to be accessible and runnable using `podman`, specifying an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and port mapping.

Sir,it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir please look into this.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations" report from a data science course, indicating the outcome of an automated or semi-automated check on a student's submission.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The document evaluates if a student's project submission meets the minimum technical requirements for "Project 1" to be considered for grading. Failure to meet these prerequisites results in the submission not being evaluated.
2.  **Core Requirement (Runnability):** The project requires a Docker image that is accessible and runnable via `podman`. A specific command `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` is provided as an example of how the image should be run, indicating it needs to expose port 8000 and handle an environment variable.
3.  **Consistency Requirement:** The Docker image used for evaluation must be built from the exact `Dockerfile` present in the student's GitHub repository.
4.  **Evaluation Outcome:** The student's submission **failed** the prerequisites overall.
    *   **Primary Failure Point:** The most critical issue identified is that the "Docker image [was not] present in dockerhub AND is public." This single failure is the direct cause of the overall prerequisite failure.
    *   **Passing Criteria:** The student successfully met other requirements:
        *   Their GitHub repository was present and public.
        *   A `Dockerfile` was present in the root of the GitHub repository.
        *   An MIT license was present at the root of the GitHub repository.
5.  **Consequence:** Due to the prerequisite failure, the "Project 1 Score" is **0**, implying the project was not fully evaluated for its content or functionality.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **Command/Instruction:**
    `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

*   **Evaluation Status Messages:**
    *   `If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated.`
    *   `These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:`
    *   `Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL`
    *   `Is Github repo present AND public: PASS`
    *   `Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS`
    *   `Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS`
    *   `Prerequisites: FAIL`
    *   `Project 1 Score: 0`*



  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

Hi Prashant,

Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation.

Kind regards

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.  
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email from a data science course, providing critical information regarding project submissions and a mandatory sanity check process.

**Key Information:**

*   **Course & Semester:** The email is for "[TDS Jan 2025]", indicating a Data Science course for the January 2025 term.
*   **Sender:** `donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **Recipient:** `25t1_se2002-announce` (Likely an announcement list for a specific batch or module).
*   **Date & Time:** Sun, Feb 16, 8:18 PM.
*   **Subject:** "[TDS Jan 2025] Important: Please check your submissions for basic sanity"
*   **Purpose:** The email informs learners about a "basic sanity check" performed on Project 1 submissions before detailed evaluation. This check ensures submissions meet fundamental technical requirements.
*   **Submission Status:** Out of "530+ submissions," only "284 submissions have cleared this basic sanity check." This implies a significant number (over 250) failed the initial checks.
*   **Previous Communication:** The course team had already sent individual emails to the "250+ learners on the errors that we observed a little while back." These emails were from the "course admin id (se2002)" with the subject `"[IMPORTANT]"`.
*   **Action Required:** Learners who failed the sanity check are instructed to "do check your Inbox and SPAM folder" for the specific email detailing their errors and "take immediate action to check for sanity of your submission and correct the errors that have been reported."
*   **Consequence:** Failure to correct errors puts "Your Project 1 submission is on the risk of scoring 0 Marks".
*   **Submission Version:** The team clarifies that they "have taken the last submission in the form for the validation."
*   **From:** TDS team

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (as requirements/IDs):**

The email does not contain direct executable code, commands, or error messages in the traditional sense, but it lists specific technical requirements and identifiers:

*   **Basic Sanity Checks (Requirements):**
    *   `- Is the GitHub repo public?`
    *   `- Does it have an MIT license?`
    *   `- Does it have a DockerFile?`
    *   `- Is the Docker image accessible?`

*   **Course Admin ID:** `se2002` (referred to as the sender of individual error emails)

*   **Email Subject for Errors:** `"[IMPORTANT]"` (the subject line of the individual emails sent to learners with errors)*

my repo has both the dockerfile with correct name (Dockerfile and in the root folder), license and is public. Please look into this . [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir . [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [GitHub - veershah1231/tds\_proj\_1: Tds project](https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1) and i have made them 2 months ago and is not a new commit.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated prerequisite evaluation report for "Project 1" in a data science course, likely sent to a student.

**Key Information:**

*   **Sender:** The message is from `22t1 se2002`, sent at `1:27 am`. This appears to be an automated system or an instructor alias for the course.
*   **Recipient:** The message is addressed `to me`, indicating it's specific feedback for the student viewing it.
*   **Context:** The message pertains to "Project 1" in a data science curriculum, emphasizing mandatory "pre-requisite checks" that must be passed for the submission to be evaluated.
*   **Penalty for Failure:** A clear statement indicates, "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."

**Defined Project 1 Prerequisites:**

The message outlines five specific requirements for Project 1:

1.  Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible
2.  Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license
3.  Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile
4.  Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
5.  Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository

**Evaluation Results:**

The report provides the specific outcome for each checked prerequisite:

*   Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: `PASS`
*   Is Github repo present AND public: `FAIL`
*   Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: `FAIL`
*   Is MIT license present at root of github repo: `FAIL`

**Overall Outcome:**

*   Prerequisites: `FAIL`
*   Project 1 Score: `0`

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **Command for running Docker image (from requirement 4):**
    `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`
*   **Evaluation Results (status messages):**
    *   `PASS`
    *   `FAIL`
*   **Final Score:**
    *   `0`

**Analysis of the Student's Status:**

The student successfully uploaded and made their Docker image public on Docker Hub. However, they failed on multiple critical GitHub repository requirements. Specifically:
1.  Their GitHub repository was either not present or not publicly accessible.
2.  The `Dockerfile` was not found in the root of their GitHub repository.
3.  The `LICENSE` file with the MIT license was not found in the root of their GitHub repository.

Because of these failures, the overall prerequisites for Project 1 were not met, resulting in the submission not being evaluated, and a preliminary score of 0. The student needs to address these GitHub repository issues (public access, Dockerfile location, LICENSE file location) before their project can be properly assessed.*



why is it saying i got 0? please look into it.

### Post #248 by **NIKHIL TEJA C** (ds-students)
*April 03, 2025, 08:56 UTC*
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) Sir I received a mail like everyone that my git-hub repository is not public and not MIT licensed. I even filled the g-form correctly while submitting.  
But I had fulfilled the above required criteria. Please look into this matter ASAP.  
Here is my git repo link : [[GitHub - 23f1001415/llm\_aa\_tds\_project](https://github.com/23f1001415/llm_aa_tds_project)]. (<https://github.com/23f1001415/llm_>  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email from a data science course platform, likely `study.iitm.ac.in` (IIT Madras), providing an automated evaluation of prerequisites for "Project 1".

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Context & Sender/Recipient Information:**
*   **Application:** Gmail web interface.
*   **Sender:** `22t1 se2002 <se2002@study.iitm.ac.in>` - This suggests an automated system or course staff account from an academic institution (IIT Madras). "22t1" might refer to a specific batch or term.
*   **Recipient:** "to me" (the user viewing the email).
*   **Subject (Implied):** Not explicitly shown in the main view, but the content clearly indicates "Project 1 Prerequisites Evaluation."
*   **Date Sent:** Tuesday, April 1, 1:22 AM (2 days ago from the current system time).
*   **Current System Date/Time:** 14:15 (2:15 PM) on 03-04-2025 (April 3, 2025), confirming the "2 days ago" timestamp.
*   **Gmail Search:** The user is currently viewing emails filtered by the search term "tds" (likely referring to "The Data Science" course).

**2. Purpose of the Email:**
*   To inform the learner about the results of prerequisite checks for "Project 1".
*   It states that failure to meet these minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.

**3. Project 1 Prerequisites (Expected Requirements):**
The email lists five specific requirements for "Project 1":
1.  "Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible"
2.  "Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license"
3.  "Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile"
4.  "Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME"
5.  "Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository"

**4. Evaluation Results:**
The email provides a specific evaluation for each criterion (or related criteria):
*   **"Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"** (This indicates requirement 4, related to public accessibility of the Docker image, has been met).
*   **"Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"** (This directly contradicts requirement 1, indicating the GitHub repository was either not found or not publicly accessible).
*   **"Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"** (This indicates requirement 3 has not been met).
*   **"Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"** (This indicates requirement 2 has not been met).

**5. Overall Outcome:**
*   **"Prerequisites: FAIL"**
*   **"Project 1 Score: 0"**
    This indicates the student has not met the necessary conditions for their Project 1 submission to be evaluated, resulting in a zero score for the prerequisites.

**6. Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

The following command is provided as an example for how the Docker image should run:
```
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
```*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository page, likely from a student or participant in a data science course, given the context of a "data science course forum." It shows the structure and recent activity of a project related to Large Language Models (LLM).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Overview:**
*   **Repository Name:** `llm_aa_tds_project`
*   **Owner/User:** `23f1001415`
*   **Visibility:** `Public`
*   **URL:** `https://github.com/23f1001415/llm_aa_tds_project`
*   **Branch:** `main` (1 branch total)
*   **Tags:** `0 Tags`
*   **Current Activity:** `0 stars`, `1 watching` (likely the repository owner), `0 forks`. This indicates it's a personal or course-specific project not yet widely adopted.
*   **Last Update:** The most recent activity visible across files is `2 months ago`, indicating the project hasn't seen recent changes.
*   **Total Commits:** `6 Commits`

**2. Project Contents & Structure:**
The repository contains a standard set of files and directories for a Python-based application, with an emphasis on containerization and data science components:

*   **Directories:**
    *   `__pycache__/`: Python bytecode cache (typically ignored by version control).
    *   `data/`: Likely contains datasets or input files for the project.
*   **Configuration/Environment Files:**
    *   `.dockerignore`: Specifies files and directories to exclude when building a Docker image.
    *   `.env`: Environment variables, possibly for configuration or credentials.
    *   `Dockerfile`: Defines the steps to build a Docker image, indicating the project is set up for containerization.
*   **Project Documentation & Licensing:**
    *   `LICENSE`: Specifies the `MIT license`, indicating the project is open-source.
    *   `README.md`: Provides a basic project description or instructions.
*   **Python Application Files:**
    *   `app.py`: The main application entry point. Given the LLM context, this could be a web application (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) or a core script.
    *   `datagen.py`: A script likely responsible for generating or preparing data.
    *   `evaluate.py`: A script for evaluating model performance or other aspects of the project.
    *   `tasksA.py`: A Python module likely containing a set of tasks or functions.
    *   `tasksB.py`: Another Python module, possibly with different tasks or related functionalities.

**3. Commit Messages (Transcribed Exactly):**
*   **Overall Last Commit (displayed at the top of the file list):** `23f1001415 Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code` (commit hash `50eacaf`)
*   **Individual File Commit Messages:**
    *   `__pycache__`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `data`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `.dockerignore`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `.env`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `Dockerfile`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `LICENSE`: `Initial commit`
    *   `README.md`: `Initial commit`
    *   `app.py`: `Create app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `evaluate.py`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`
    *   `tasksA.py`: `Create tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`: `Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code`

**4. Technologies Used (Languages Section):**
*   **Python:** `98.4%` (Dominant language)
*   **Dockerfile:** `1.6%` (Used for containerization)

**5. Missing Information/Further Details:**
*   **No Repository Description:** The "About" section states "No description, website, or topics provided," suggesting it's an early-stage project or a private project not intended for public discovery.
*   **No Releases or Packages:** This confirms it's a development repository, not a deployed application or library.
*   **No Explicit Code/Commands/Errors:** The screenshot is of the GitHub file browser, so there are no code snippets, terminal commands, or error messages displayed within the main content area.

**6. Contextual Clues:**
*   The browser tabs show `TDS Jan 25 Pr...` which could refer to a "The Data Science" course or similar.
*   Multiple GitHub tabs open suggest the user is actively working with or browsing GitHub repositories, possibly as part of a course or project.
*   The date in the bottom right corner shows `03-04-2025`, indicating the screenshot was taken (or the system clock was set to) April 3rd, 2025.

In summary, this is a well-structured, containerized Python project, likely part of an LLM-focused data science curriculum, that has been set up but not actively developed or deployed recently.*

This was your submission and we could not locate a docker repo against it.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a "404 Not Found" error page on Docker Hub, indicating that the requested resource could not be found.

Here's a detailed analysis:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform:** The user is on **Docker Hub** (`hub.docker.com`), which is a cloud-based registry service for building, storing, and distributing Docker images.
2.  **Navigation:** The top navigation bar shows "Explore" (currently selected) and "My Hub". There's also a search bar labeled "Search Docker Hub" with a "Ctrl+K" shortcut.
3.  **User Context:** The user appears to be logged in, indicated by the initial "J" in a blue circle in the top right corner. The browser also shows an "Update" button, suggesting the browser itself might need an update.
4.  **Attempted Action (URL & Breadcrumbs):**
    *   **URL:** The URL in the address bar is `https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags`.
    *   **Breadcrumbs:** The page also displays breadcrumbs: "Explore / vedant2204 / project". This indicates the user was attempting to navigate to a repository named `project` under the user or organization `vedant2204`, specifically trying to access its `tags` section.
5.  **Error Message:** The main content area prominently displays a "404 Not Found" error.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **URL:** `https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags`
*   **Breadcrumbs:** `Explore / vedant2204 / project`
*   **Main Error Code:** `404`
*   **Error Message 1:** `Oops!`
*   **Error Message 2:** `The page you have requested was not found`
*   **Search Shortcut Hint:** `Ctrl+K`

**Implications for a Data Science Course Forum:**

This screenshot would typically be posted in a data science course forum if a student or instructor is encountering an issue related to:

*   **Accessing a specific Docker image:** They might be trying to find or pull a Docker image relevant to a course project (e.g., an image containing specific libraries or environments like Jupyter, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   **Incorrect Repository Name:** The `vedant2204/project` part of the URL is likely the name of the Docker image repository. A 404 error here suggests that either:
    *   The repository `project` does not exist under the `vedant2204` user/organization.
    *   There's a typo in the `vedant2204` username or the `project` repository name.
    *   The repository might exist but is private, and the logged-in user (`J`) does not have permissions to view it (though a 404 is more typical for "not found" than "access denied").
    *   The repository or its `tags` page was deleted or moved.
*   **Incorrect Path within a Repository:** The `/tags` suffix might be an incorrect or outdated path for viewing repository tags.
*   **Troubleshooting Docker Builds/Pulls:** A student might be trying to verify that an image they were told to use or build is indeed available on Docker Hub, and this screenshot shows they hit a roadblock.

The user `J` needs to verify the correct username (`vedant2204`) and repository name (`project`) on Docker Hub, and potentially the exact path to view its tags.*

If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a page from a container image registry (very similar in appearance and functionality to Docker Hub), showcasing details for a specific repository. Given the context of a data science course forum, this would likely be part of a discussion on deploying machine learning models or API services using Docker.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Identification:**
*   **Repository Name:** `zakiy7/my-fastapi-app`
*   **Owner/Publisher:** `zakiy7`
*   **Type:** Indicated by the "IMAGE" label and the container-like icon, this is a Docker or OCI-compliant container image repository.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Updated about 1 month ago.
    *   0 stars, 26 downloads (suggesting it might be a private, course-specific, or new public repository).

**2. Navigation and Overview:**
*   The user is currently viewing the "Tags" section of the repository, which lists different versions (tags) of the container image available.
*   The current sort order for tags is "Newest".
*   There's a "Filter tags" search bar, allowing users to search for specific image tags.

**3. Details of the `latest` Image Tag:**
*   **Tag Name:** `latest` (a common default tag for the most recent stable build of an image).
*   **Last Pushed:** This specific `latest` tag was pushed "about 1 month ago" by `zakiy7`.
*   **Digest:** `740fcf3f65bb` (This is a truncated SHA256 hash of the image manifest, providing a unique and immutable identifier for this specific image build).
*   **OS/ARCH:** `linux/amd64` (Indicates the image is built for Linux operating systems running on AMD64/x86-64 architecture, which is standard for most server deployments).
*   **Last Pull:** The `latest` tag was last pulled "5 days" ago, indicating recent usage or download activity.
*   **Compressed Size:** `261.49 MB` (This is the size of the compressed image layers that will be downloaded).

**4. How to Pull the Image (Code/Command):**
*   The screenshot prominently displays the command required to download this specific image tag using Docker.
*   Next to the `latest` tag details, there is a ready-to-copy command:

```
docker pull zakiy7/my-fastapi-app:latest
```

This command instructs the Docker client to download the image named `zakiy7/my-fastapi-app` with the tag `latest` from the configured Docker registry. This is the primary way users would obtain and run this containerized application.*



  
Hi sir, my Architecture says amd64, in the google docs I have selected x86, i hope it is correct. Also, I have used podman to test the pull and its working well. Please let me know if i need to do anything else.

We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.

That way there is no architecture issues.

Its part of our secondary check. And more students have gotten scores in this check. So dont worry.

Am assuming no lenient correction can be done for that? like during the evaluation …

podman run --rm -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:5000 $IMAGE\_NAME

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the main page of a GitHub repository, likely belonging to a student or team working on a data science or machine learning project, given the context of a "data science course forum."

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Details:**

*   **URL:** `github.com/23f1002643/llm-automation-agent`
    *   This indicates the repository owner is `23f1002643` (possibly a student ID or project identifier) and the repository name is `llm-automation-agent`.
    *   "LLM" stands for Large Language Model, and "automation-agent" suggests a project focused on building an automated system using LLMs, which is highly relevant to modern AI/data science.
*   **Branch:** The current branch displayed is `main`.
*   **Branch Count:** There is `1 Branch`.
*   **Tag Count:** There are `0 Tags`.
*   **Search/Action Bar:**
    *   A "Go to file" search bar is present with a 't' shortcut hint.
    *   "Add file" button dropdown.
    *   "Code" button dropdown (typically for cloning/downloading the repository).

**2. Latest Commit Information (for the `main` branch):**

*   **Commit Message:** `23f1002643 Add files via upload` (This is the latest commit message for the entire `main` branch, although individual files might have older, distinct commit messages).
*   **Commit Hash (partial):** `c883879`
*   **Commit Age:** `2 months ago`
*   **Total Commits:** `4 Commits` (clickable link to view commit history).

**3. Repository Contents (Files and Folders):**

The repository contains several files and one folder, all of which appear to have been committed `2 months ago`. The commit messages for individual files are `Add files via upload` (for most) or `Initial commit` (for `LICENSE` and `README.md`).

*   **`__pycache__`** (Folder): This is a standard directory created by Python to store bytecode compiled from source files (`.pyc` files). It's typically excluded from version control in production projects, so its presence suggests an initial or less refined setup.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`Dockerfile`** (File): Indicates the project is set up for containerization (e.g., using Docker). This is common for deploying data science applications and ensuring reproducible environments.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`LICENSE`** (File): A standard file defining the legal terms under which the project can be used and distributed.
    *   Last Commit: `Initial commit`, `2 months ago`
*   **`README.md`** (File): A Markdown file serving as the project's main documentation, providing an overview, instructions, etc.
    *   Last Commit: `Initial commit`, `2 months ago`
*   **`app.py`** (File): Likely the main application script for the LLM automation agent.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`datagen.py`** (File): Suggests a script responsible for generating data, which is crucial for training, fine-tuning, or testing LLMs.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`evaluate.py`** (File): Implies a script for evaluating the performance or output of the LLM automation agent, essential for measuring success and iterating on the model.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`requirements.txt`** (File): A standard Python file listing all project dependencies. This is critical for others (or the developer themselves) to set up the correct Python environment to run the project.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`tasksA.py`** (File): Suggests a module or script containing definitions or implementations for a set of tasks (Task A) that the LLM agent can perform.
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`
*   **`tasksB.py`** (File): Similar to `tasksA.py`, likely containing definitions or implementations for another set of tasks (Task B).
    *   Last Commit: `Add files via upload`, `2 months ago`

**4. User Context (from browser tabs/bookmarks):**

The user's browser tabs/bookmarks visible at the top include "My Dashboard", "TDS" (likely The Data Science or a similar abbreviation), "Java", "MLP" (Machine Learning Project/Pipelines), "SC" (Software Construction/Cybersecurity), "TDS" again, "Rajasthan Books", "Difficulty Rating for...", and "20 Best Account Ma...". This broad range of technical and academic topics further supports the idea that the user is involved in a technical, possibly educational, setting related to data science and software development.

**Summary for a Data Science Course Forum:**

This GitHub repository showcases an `llm-automation-agent` project, indicating a practical application of Large Language Models. The file structure with `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `Dockerfile` suggests a well-structured project covering data generation, application logic, task definitions, evaluation, and containerization for deployment. The presence of `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` is excellent for reproducibility. The `2 months ago` commit history with only 4 commits suggests it's a relatively new or recently completed project, perhaps a course assignment. The repeated "Add files via upload" commit messages might suggest the user is new to Git command-line workflows and uploaded files directly via the GitHub web interface.*



  
I checked it multiple times before submitting, I got 9/10 in task A.

Sir,  
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log output from a data science environment, likely showing the results of a dependency installation process followed by an attempt to run a Python script, which ultimately failed.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Package Building and Downloading:** The log indicates the system was building and downloading several Python packages commonly used in data science and database operations.
    *   **Building:** `antiorm==1.2.1`, `db==0.1.1`, `db-sqlite3==0.0.1`. These appear to be database-related libraries, with specific versions.
    *   **Downloading:** `scipy (35.6MiB)`, `pandas (12.1MiB)`, `numpy (15.4MiB)`, `pydantic-core (1.9MiB)`, `duckdb (19.3MiB)`. These are core data science libraries, with their respective download sizes.

2.  **Successful Installation:**
    *   The log confirms that `pydantic-core`, `numpy`, `duckdb`, `pandas`, and `scipy` were successfully downloaded.
    *   The built packages (`antiorm`, `db`, `db-sqlite3`) were also confirmed as built.
    *   A summary line states that "Installed 33 packages in 56ms", indicating a very quick and seemingly successful overall dependency installation.

3.  **Program Execution Error:**
    *   Immediately after the successful installation, a Python `Traceback` is shown, indicating a runtime error in a user's script.
    *   The error occurred in the file `/app/app.py` on line 22.
    *   The specific line of code that caused the error is `from tasksA import *`.
    *   The error message is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'`, meaning the Python interpreter could not find a module or package named `tasksA` when trying to import it. This suggests that `tasksA` is either a custom module that was not correctly placed in the Python path, or it's a third-party package that was not included in the installation process (unlike the other packages listed).

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository, likely part of a data science course project, showcasing the contents of a `Dockerfile`.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Context:**
*   **Platform:** GitHub web interface.
*   **User/Organization:** `GaURaVinDeX`
*   **Repository Name:** `tds-project1`
*   **Current View:** The "Code" tab is active, showing the file browser and the content of a selected file.
*   **Commit Message:** The current view is for the `Initial commit` by `GaURaVinDeX`.

**2. Repository Details (Left Pane - File Browser):**
*   **Branch:** `main` (selected in the branch dropdown).
*   **File Structure:**
    *   `__pycache__` (folder)
    *   `.gitignore`
    *   `Dockerfile` (currently selected and displayed)
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `app.py`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`

**3. Dockerfile Content and Purpose (Right Pane):**
The `Dockerfile` is being displayed, indicating an attempt to containerize a Python application. It contains 23 lines (16 lines of code excluding comments/blank lines) and is 607 Bytes.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Comments (Dockerfile):**

```dockerfile
1 FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm
2
3 # Install dependencies
4 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates
5
6 # Download and install uv
7 ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
8 RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh
9
10 # Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
11 RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn
12
13 # Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
14 ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"
15
16 # Set up the application directory
17 WORKDIR /app
18
19 # Copy application files
20 COPY app.py /app
21
22 # Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
23 CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]
```

**4. Analysis of Dockerfile Steps:**
*   **Base Image:** `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm` - Uses a slim Debian-based Python 3.12 image.
*   **System Dependencies:** Installs `curl` and `ca-certificates` using `apt-get`.
*   **`uv` Installation:** Downloads and runs `uv/install.sh` from `astral.sh` to install `uv`, then removes the installer script. `uv` is a modern, fast Python package installer and runner.
*   **Python Package Installation:** Installs `fastapi` and `uvicorn` using `pip` (or `uv` acting as `pip`). This suggests the application is a FastAPI web service.
*   **PATH Configuration:** Adds `/root/.local/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable, likely where `uv` is installed.
*   **Application Directory Setup:**
    *   `WORKDIR /app`: Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container for subsequent instructions.
    *   `COPY app.py /app`: Copies the `app.py` file from the host's build context into the `/app` directory inside the container.
*   **Application Command:** `CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]` - Specifies the default command to execute when the container starts. It uses `uv` to run the `app.py` script.

**5. Highlighted Section:**
A red rectangle and arrow highlight a crucial part of the Dockerfile:
*   The rectangle encompasses lines 16, 17, 19, and 20.
*   Line 16: `# Set up the application directory` (Comment)
*   Line 17: `WORKDIR /app` (Command to set the working directory)
*   Line 19: `# Copy application files` (Comment)
*   Line 20: `COPY app.py /app` (Command to copy the application's main file)
*   The arrow specifically points to the comment `# Copy application files`.

**Significance of Highlighted Section:**
This section is critical for any Dockerized application. It defines where the application files reside within the container and how the main application file (`app.py`) is brought into the image. Issues here (e.g., incorrect paths, forgetting to copy files) are common sources of errors when building and running Docker images. The highlight suggests this might be a point of instruction or a potential area of concern for users in the data science course.*



  
You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email or forum message from the "TDS Team" to a learner, "22t1 se2002," regarding the prerequisite evaluation for "Project 1" in a data science course.

The core information conveyed is that the learner's Project 1 submission did not pass the mandatory prerequisite checks and, as a result, will not be further evaluated, resulting in a score of 0.

The email outlines five key prerequisites for Project 1:
1.  The GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible.
2.  The GitHub repository must contain a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
3.  The GitHub repository must have a valid `Dockerfile`.
4.  The Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via a specific `podman run` command.
5.  The Docker image must use the same `Dockerfile` as in the GitHub repository.

The email then presents the specific evaluation results for the learner's submission:
*   The Docker image was successfully found in Dockerhub and was public.
*   The GitHub repository was found and was public.
*   The `Dockerfile` was present in the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **However, the MIT license file was *not* found at the root of the GitHub repository.**

This single failure led to the overall prerequisite status being "FAIL," and consequently, the Project 1 score being 0. A concluding note advises against replying to the email and directs the learner to contact the course team for further assistance.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository hosted by a user named "00-Arya". It provides an overview of the project's file structure and basic repository statistics. This is a common way for students or practitioners in a data science course to share and manage their code and projects.

### Key Information:

1.  **Repository Identity and Status:**
    *   **URL:** `github.com/00-Arya` (This indicates the repository belongs to the GitHub user "00-Arya". The specific repository name isn't fully visible but implies it might be the user's profile repository or a project named "00-Arya".)
    *   **Visibility:** Public repository.
    *   **Statistics:**
        *   **Stars:** 0
        *   **Forks:** 0
        *   **Watching:** 1 (likely the owner)
        *   **Branch:** 1 (`main` branch is currently selected)
        *   **Tags:** 0
    *   **Last Commit:** The latest commit was made by "00-Aryan" 2 months ago, suggesting the project hasn't been updated recently.

2.  **File and Folder Structure (Indicative of a Data Science Project):**
    The directory listing shows several files and folders, many of which are characteristic of a data science or machine learning project:
    *   `__pycache__` (folder): A standard directory created by Python to cache compiled bytecode, common in Python projects.
    *   `data` (folder): Highly indicative of a data science project, suggesting that datasets, either raw or processed, are stored here.
    *   `.env` (file): A file typically used to store environment variables, which can include API keys, database connection strings, or other configuration settings, vital for deployment or local setup.
    *   `Dockerfile` (file): This file indicates that the project is designed to be containerized using Docker. This is crucial for creating reproducible environments, especially in data science, to ensure models run consistently across different machines.
    *   `LICENCE` (file): Contains the licensing information for the project, indicating how others can use, modify, and distribute the code.
    *   `app.py` (file): Often the main application entry point. In a data science context, this could be a script for a web application (e.g., Streamlit, Flask) that serves a model, an API endpoint, or the primary pipeline orchestrator.
    *   `datagen.py` (file): Suggests a script responsible for data generation, data augmentation, or preparing data for model training/evaluation. This is a common component in machine learning workflows.
    *   `evaluate.py` (file): A script likely used for evaluating the performance of models, calculating metrics, or running validation tests. Essential for assessing model success.
    *   `requirements.txt` (file): Lists all the Python packages and their versions that are necessary for the project to run. This ensures that anyone setting up the project can install the exact dependencies needed.
    *   `tasksA.py` (file): Suggests a script related to a specific task or module named "Task A".
    *   `tasksB.py` (file): Similarly, suggests a script related to "Task B". The presence of distinct task files implies a structured approach to different problem components or assignments within the project.

3.  **Repository Footers:**
    *   **README:** Indicates that a `README.md` file is present (though not visible in this specific view), which usually provides a description of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.
    *   **MIT license:** Explicitly states the project is under the MIT License.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There are no code snippets, command-line outputs, or error messages visible in this screenshot. The content displayed is solely the file and folder names within a GitHub repository.

**File/Folder Names (as they appear):**

*   `__pycache__`
*   `data`
*   `.env`
*   `Dockerfile`
*   `LICENCE`
*   `app.py`
*   `datagen.py`
*   `evaluate.py`
*   `requirements.txt`
*   `tasksA.py`
*   `tasksB.py`*

[@thinkmachine](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/thinkmachine)

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief.

*However* with regards to your long post…

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a *very* experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
2. Wastes valuable time and resources
3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
4. Complicates testing
5. Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards

Hi Sir,  
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is **4db729a03f74** , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.  
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from a Docker image registry or a similar platform (like Docker Hub, GitLab Container Registry, etc.), providing details about a specific Docker image tag. In a data science course forum context, this information is critical for students to correctly pull and utilize pre-built environments or project dependencies.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

*   **Image Tag:** The specific version or label of the Docker image being displayed is `version1`. This allows users to target a particular snapshot of the image.
*   **Last Pushed:** The image tag `version1` was last pushed approximately `1 month` ago by the user `abhay227`. This indicates the recency of the image update and who is responsible for it.
*   **Image Digest:** A unique identifier for the image's content is `4db729a03f74`. This is typically a truncated SHA256 hash, ensuring that the pulled image is exactly what was intended, preventing content tampering.
*   **Operating System/Architecture:** The image is built for `linux/amd64` systems. This is crucial for compatibility, as it means the image is designed to run on standard Linux environments with AMD64 (x86_64) processors.
*   **Last Pulled:** This specific image (or digest) was last pulled about `1 month` ago. This indicates its usage activity.
*   **Compressed Size:** The compressed size of the Docker image is `261.98 MB`. This gives users an idea of the download size and the disk space required for the image.
*   **Docker Pull Command:** A ready-to-use command is provided for users to download this specific image. This is the most actionable piece of information for a student in a data science course.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Docker Pull Command:**
    ```
    docker pull abhay227/tds_project:version1
    ```
*   **No error messages are visible in the screenshot.***

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Kind regards

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton). It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) *tedious* assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.

*(…caution: long post ahead )*

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers**: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it’s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

* Reason about the task, understand intent,
* Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
* Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
* Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in [this ICLR 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools**:

* A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
* A Python script runner
* A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was **emergent behavior**, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.

---

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a very small, cropped segment of what appears to be a tabular data structure, typical of a spreadsheet, a data frame output, or a database table view.

**Key Information:**

*   **Column Header/Label:** There is a cell in the top row labeled **B1**. This suggests it's a column name or identifier.
*   **Data Value:** Directly below the "B1" label, in the next row, there is a cell containing the numerical value **0**. This indicates that the first (or an initial) entry for the column "B1" is zero.
*   **Context:** Given the context of a data science course forum, this snippet likely represents a small part of a dataset being discussed, possibly showing an example of a specific column's values, or an output from a data manipulation operation.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit code, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The visible elements "B1" and "0" are a column label and a data value, respectively.*

**Key Information:**

1.  **Task Completion:** A step or test labeled "B1" has successfully passed, indicated by the green checkmark.
2.  **Current Running Task:** A new task is currently in progress, marked by a yellow circle. This task is explicitly identified as "Delete /data/format.md". This means the system is attempting to remove a file named `format.md` from the `/data` directory.
3.  **Task Execution Mechanism:** The deletion task is being initiated via an HTTP POST request.
    *   The request is directed to a local server running on `localhost` at port `8325`, specifically to the `/run` endpoint.
    *   The task to be executed ("Delete /data/format.md") is passed as a URL query parameter (`task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md`). The `+` represents a space, and `%2F` represents a forward slash (`/`) in the URL encoding.
4.  **HTTP Request Status:** The HTTP request itself was successful, receiving an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" response. This indicates that the server successfully received and processed the request to initiate the deletion task. It does *not* necessarily mean the file has already been deleted, but that the command to delete it was successfully sent and accepted.

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files

Dear [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir  
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

* My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
* I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
* I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
* For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a grading email from a data science course, likely at IIT Madras, detailing the score breakdown for a project.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Scoring System:**
*   Each completed task (A1-A10, B1-B10) is worth 1 mark.
*   C1-C5 are designated as bonus tasks.
*   The total score is out of 20.
*   Task scores are normalized to 20 based on the highest score in Project 1 (which was 16).
*   Each successfully completed task, after normalization, contributes **1.25** marks to the final score (20 / 16 = 1.25).

**2. Bonus Calculation:**
*   Bonus is awarded based on **number of commits** and **repo size**.
*   These features are processed by removing cache and environment files to prevent outliers from influencing scores.
*   A "power transform and scaling with weights of 2.5" is applied to each of these bonus features.

**3. Final Score Calculation:**
*   The final score is capped at 20.
*   The formula is: `MIN (20, (task score + bonus))`

**4. Submitted Repositories:**
*   **Github repo submitted:** `https://github.com/harrypandey829/tds_llm_automation-agent`
*   **Docker repo submitted:** `hariompandey6388/ll-automation-agent2`

**5. Pre-requisites Check Results (1 for pass, 0 for fail):**
*   **Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb):** `1` (Pass)
*   **Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb):** `0` (Fail)
*   **Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License):** `0` (Fail)
*   **Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists:** `0` (Fail)

**6. Task Scores:**
The table shows the individual scores for tasks A1 through B10. All visible task scores are **0**.
*   A1: `0`
*   A2: `0`
*   A3: `0`
*   A4: `0`
*   A5: `0`
*   A6: `0`
*   A7: `0`
*   A8: `0`
*   A9: `0`
*   A10: `0`
*   B1: `0`
*   B2: `0`
*   B3: `0`
*   B4: `0`
*   B5: `0`
*   B6: `0`
*   B7: `0`
*   B8: `0`
*   B9: `0`
*   B10: `0`
*   Tasks C1-C5 are partially visible but their scores are cut off.

**Summary and Implications for the User:**
The user whose report this is seems to have significant issues with their GitHub repository submission. Their GitHub repo failed to be found or was not public, and it was missing a LICENSE/LICENSE.md file and a Dockerfile. These prerequisite failures likely explain why all visible task scores (A1-A10, B1-B10) are `0`, as the grading system might not have been able to access or process their work correctly. The Docker repo, however, did pass its existence check. The final score will be heavily impacted by these zero task scores and potential loss of bonus due to GitHub issues.*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository page, likely belonging to a student or participant in a data science course, given its context within a "data science course forum."

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Identification:**
*   **URL:** `github.com/harrypandey829/tds_llm_automation-agent`
*   **Owner:** `harrypandey829`
*   **Repository Name:** `tds_llm_automation-agent`
*   **Visibility:** `Public`
*   **Engagement:** `0 stars`, `1 watching`, `0 forks` (suggesting a new, personal, or course-specific project not yet widely adopted or shared).

**2. Project Context & Description:**
*   **About Section:** `This is my final effort towards tds project.`
    *   **Analysis:** This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that the repository represents a completed or final submission for a project, likely related to a course or initiative identified as "tds" (possibly "The Data Science" project/course). The repository name `tds_llm_automation-agent` further supports this.

**3. Repository Content and Structure:**
*   **Current Branch:** `main` (default branch selected).
*   **Commit History:** `3 Commits` (indicating a very recent project or one in early development).
*   **License:** `MIT license` (explicitly stated in the "About" section and indicated by a `LICENSE` file), showing it's an open-source project.
*   **Programming Language:** Predominantly `Python 100.0%` (partially visible in the "Languages" section), which is typical for LLM and data science projects.

**4. Key Files and Directories (indicating project functionality):**
*   **`_pycache_` (folder):** A standard directory for compiled Python bytecode, common in Python projects.
*   **`.env` (file):** Indicates the presence of environment variables, likely for configuration, API keys (e.g., for LLMs), or sensitive information, which is good practice.
*   **`LICENSE` (file):** Contains the MIT license text.
*   **`app.py`:** Likely the main application script or entry point for the LLM automation agent.
*   **`datagen.py`:** Suggests functionality for data generation, which could be for training, testing, or synthesizing data relevant to the LLM agent's tasks.
*   **`dockerfile`:** A critical file for containerization, indicating that the project is designed for reproducibility and easy deployment (e.g., using Docker). This is a common and highly valued practice in modern data science and MLOps.
*   **`evaluate.py`:** Implies a script dedicated to evaluating the performance, accuracy, or effectiveness of the LLM automation agent.
*   **`tasksA.py`:**
*   **`tasksB.py`:** These two files suggest modularization of different tasks or functionalities that the LLM automation agent is designed to perform. They might define specific prompts, workflows, or sub-agents.
*   **`README`:** A `README` file is present (indicated by the `README` link at the bottom), which would typically contain project setup, usage instructions, and further details.

**5. Release & Package Status:**
*   **Releases:** `No releases published`
*   **Packages:** `No packages published`
    *   **Analysis:** This is consistent with a course project or a new personal project that hasn't reached a formal release stage or published reusable Python packages.

**Summary for a Data Science Course Forum:**
This screenshot shows `harrypandey829`'s GitHub repository for their `tds_llm_automation-agent` project, which is explicitly stated as their "final effort towards tds project." The project is a public, Python-based application focusing on an LLM automation agent. Key files like `dockerfile`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `tasksA/B.py` suggest a well-structured project with components for data handling, containerization, performance evaluation, and specific task implementation. The low commit count and lack of releases indicate it's either a very new project or perhaps a final, clean submission. Forum members looking for examples of LLM-based course projects, especially those leveraging Docker for reproducibility, would find this relevant.

Hi sir  
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.  
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir  
Thank you

Dear [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir,

I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot appears to show the results or feedback for a component of an assignment or task within a data science course.

1.  **Failure Indicator:** The top line, marked with a red 'X' icon, indicates that a specific test or component identified as "B10" has "FAILED". This suggests there's an issue with this particular part of the student's submission or code.
2.  **Partial Score:** The second line shows a "Score: 8 / 20". This indicates that the student achieved 8 points out of a possible 20. The failure of "B10" likely contributed to this incomplete score.
3.  **HTTP Request Detail:** The bottom line provides a technical detail about an "HTTP Request". It specifies a "POST" request being made to a URL that starts with "https://aiprc". This suggests the task involves interacting with an API or an external service (e.g., submitting results, querying data, validating code), and this request might be related to the "B10 FAILED" status. The URL is truncated, so the full endpoint is not visible.

**Transcriptions:**

*   Error Message: `B10 FAILED`
*   Score: `Score: 8 / 20`
*   Command/Request: `HTTP Request: POST https://aiprc`*

Respected sir,  
I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.

Dear [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir,  
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.  
Thank you.

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi Hari,

I just *manually* checked your repo.



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a description of the key information from the provided image:

This screenshot displays a web browser window showing a "404 Not Found" error page on GitHub.com. The user was attempting to access a specific GitHub repository, likely related to course materials or a project.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Browser Context:** The image shows a standard web browser interface (e.g., Chrome, Edge) with navigation buttons (back, forward, refresh) and an address bar.
2.  **Website:** The user is on `github.com`, identifiable by the URL and the prominent GitHub Octocat mascot in the error page design.
3.  **Attempted Resource:** The address bar indicates the user was trying to access a repository located at `https://github.com/harrypandey829/tds_llm_automation-agent`.
    *   `harrypandey829` is likely the GitHub username or organization.
    *   `tds_llm_automation-agent` is the name of the repository the user was trying to reach.
4.  **Error Type:** The large "404" prominently displayed signifies an HTTP 404 Not Found error. This means the server could not find the requested resource (the specified GitHub repository or page within it) at the provided URL.
5.  **Error Message:** Accompanying the 404 code, there is a playful, Star Wars-themed message: "This is not the web page you are looking for."
6.  **Visual Cue:** The GitHub Octocat is depicted in what appears to be a Jedi robe, reinforcing the Star Wars reference in the error message and adding to GitHub's characteristic branding. The background looks like a desert scene (reminiscent of Tatooine), further enhancing the "lost" or "not found" theme.

**Implications for a Data Science Course Forum:**

*   A user is likely trying to access code, data, or project files hosted on GitHub as part of their data science course.
*   The "404 Not Found" error suggests one of the following:
    *   A typo in the URL entered by the user.
    *   The repository `tds_llm_automation-agent` under the `harrypandey829` account has been moved, renamed, deleted, or made private.
    *   The link provided in the course materials might be outdated or incorrect.
*   The user would need assistance in either verifying the correct URL, finding an alternative resource, or determining if the repository has been removed.

**Transcribed Information (Code, Commands, or Error Messages Exactly as They Appear):**

*   **URL:** `https://github.com/harrypandey829/tds_llm_automation-agent`
*   **Error Code:** `404`
*   **Error Message:** `This is not the web page you are looking for.`*

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir When I submitted project 1, I was passing part A with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code.  
Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum, detailing the key information and transcribing relevant elements:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Project Context:** The project is named `LLM_Automation_Agent-main`, suggesting a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and automated task execution.

2.  **Development Environment:** The user is working in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on a Windows machine (indicated by `PS C:\Users\avina\...` in the terminal). The project is likely Python-based given the `.py` files and listed dependencies.

3.  **File Structure:**
    *   The project contains common Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`).
    *   There's a `data` directory containing `ticket-sales.db` (an SQLite database file) and `ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
    *   Other standard files like `dockerfile` and `LICENSE` are present.

4.  **`app.py` Content:** The `app.py` file, currently open in the editor, appears to be an application script. Its commented-out lines indicate potential dependencies for the project, hinting at its functionality.

5.  **Specific Task (A10) Description:**
    *   The terminal output reveals "A10 Task".
    *   **Goal:** Calculate the "total sales of all the items in the `Gold` ticket type" from the SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db`.
    *   **Database Schema:** The `ticket-sales.db` database has a table named `tickets` with columns: `type`, `units`, and `price`.
    *   **Output Requirement:** The calculated total sales value must be written to the file `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.

6.  **Execution Flow and Outcome for Task A10:**
    *   **Instruction Delivery:** An initial HTTP 200 response contains the task instruction, URL-encoded: `the+items+in+the+%22Gold%22+ticket+type%3F+Write+the+number+in+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales-gold.txt%60`. This implies the task was successfully received and the instruction to write the answer to the specified file was processed.
    *   **Verification:** A subsequent HTTP GET request was made to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` to read the content of the file that was supposed to contain the answer. This request also returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, meaning the file was successfully read.
    *   **Evaluation Failure:**
        *   **Expected Result:** The system expected the value `177250.79` in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
        *   **Actual Result:** The value found in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` was `200401.84`.
        *   **Conclusion:** Due to the mismatch, "A10 FAILED".

7.  **Scoring:** The message "Score: 1 / 10" indicates that this is part of an assessed problem or challenge, and the user only received 1 point out of a possible 10 for Task A10, likely because the file was written to, but with an incorrect value.

8.  **Problems Count:** The "PROBLEMS" tab shows a count of `4`, suggesting there are other issues or errors within the project, potentially related to other tasks or code quality.

To replicate the test environment:

Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

```
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser (description="Fetch the latest commit before a given deadline.")
parser.add_argument (
    "--owner",
    type=str,

    help="GitHub username."
)
parser.add_argument (
    "--repo",

        # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs (extract_path, exist_ok=True)

        # Extract the zip file
        with zipfile.ZipFile (extract_path + zip_filename, "r") as zip_ref:

```

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

These instructions are same for everyone. So check first before posting here.

Then post with your queries after testing as mentioned above.  
Also check the evaluation logs first to see why it failed. Address that question.  
Posting “it ran before submission” is insufficient evidence.  
The whole point of deployability is that it runs anywhere at anytime.  
That is what is being tested, not that it ran on your machine (unless you replicate the test environment exactly).

Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.

Dear [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir,  
I run evalution script that you provide us via mail recently, my code is actively running and able to pass 11 task but I was awarded 1 Marks pls check where is the issue,[My full code was done in linux Environment] (github codespace)  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from a development environment, likely VS Code, running within a data science or programming course context, specifically related to Large Language Models. It shows the output of a test or assessment run, indicating both successes and failures, along with a system prompt and an IDE recommendation.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Assessment/Task Status:**
    *   A test or challenge identified as "C5" has failed.
    *   The specific reason for C5's failure is the inability to read a file: `/data/c5.txt`. This failure is confirmed by an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` which resulted in a "404 NOT FOUND" error. This strongly suggests the file is either missing, the path is incorrect, or the local server is not correctly serving the file.
    *   Another HTTP request, a POST to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`, was successful with a "200 OK" status. This indicates that part of the task, possibly related to generating or using embeddings from an OpenAI-like API, worked correctly.
    *   The user's current score is `11 / 25`, implying partial completion or success on some tasks, but significant points were lost, likely due to the C5 failure and potentially other unseen issues.

2.  **User & Project Context:**
    *   The user's identity is `singh-yash129`.
    *   The user is currently working within the directory `/workspaces/Large-Language-Model`, suggesting the course or project is focused on Large Language Models.
    *   The Git branch indicated is `(main)`.

3.  **Development Environment:**
    *   The interface strongly resembles VS Code.
    *   There's a pop-up dialog recommending the installation of the official `Python` extension from Microsoft, which is critical for Python development features like IntelliSense, debugging, and linting. This indicates that Python is the primary language being used for this project.
    *   The status bar at the bottom shows:
        *   Cursor position: `Ln 61, Col 4`
        *   Indentation: `Spaces: 4`
        *   File Encoding: `UTF-8`
        *   Line Endings: `LF`
        *   Detected Language: `Python`
        *   A "Chat limit reached" notification is also present, possibly from a built-in AI assistant feature.

**Things i have done for my project to work locally:**

carlton:

> `git clone <your repo url>`

cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from a file explorer or project sidebar within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or code editor, likely Visual Studio Code, given its typical dark theme and iconography. It displays the structure of a project named "TDS_PROJECT_1".

### Key Information:

1.  **Project Root:** The main project directory is named `TDS_PROJECT_1`. It is currently expanded, showing its contents.
2.  **Sub-Directory:** Inside `TDS_PROJECT_1`, there is a sub-directory named `tds-project-1`. This directory is currently collapsed (indicated by the `>` arrow) and has a small green circle next to it, which often signifies a status, such as being untracked or recently modified in a version control system like Git.
3.  **File:** Also within `TDS_PROJECT_1`, there is a file named `LICENSE`. It is represented with a key icon, which is a standard visual cue for license files.
4.  **Toolbar Icons:** Above the project structure, there are several common IDE toolbar icons, which typically allow users to:
    *   Create a New File (icon with a document and a plus sign).
    *   Create a New Folder (icon with a folder and a plus sign).
    *   Refresh/Reload the file explorer (circular arrow icon).
    *   Possibly Collapse All folders or perform another file management action (stack of documents icon).
5.  **Context:** This setup indicates a newly initialized or very early stage of a data science project, as it contains a primary project folder, a sub-folder (perhaps for source code or specific project components), and a standard `LICENSE` file.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There is no explicit code, commands, or error messages visible in this screenshot. The transcribed elements are file and folder names:

*   `TDS_PROJECT_1`
*   `tds-project-1`
*   `LICENSE`*



All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.

carlton:

> Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder

when i do this( ) i get this error

carlton:

> `docker build -t <your image name>`

```
PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1> docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build

```

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):  
1)

```
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

```

**OR**  
2)

```
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

```

*Both the things work for me*()

carlton:

> `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name>`

```
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

```

Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)

carlton:

> `uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2003751@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 

```

Done this to evaluate my project

Any finally the main part (DRUM ROLLS ,not this one (IUKUK))



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot, describing the key information and transcribing the visible text.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The screenshot displays a terminal interface, likely within a VS Code or similar IDE environment, indicated by the tabs "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "TERMINAL" (currently active), "PORTS", "COMMENTS", and "DEBUG CONSOLE".
2.  **Task Description (C5):** The user is attempting a task labeled "C5", which involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) or sentiment analysis. The specific task is to determine if the statement `'I hate you'` has a positive or negative connotation.
3.  **Expected Output:** The result of the sentiment analysis should be saved as a single string containing either `'POSITIVE'` or `'NEGATIVE'` (in uppercase) to the file `/data/c5.txt`.
4.  **Task Outcome:** Task "C5 failed" and resulted in a score of "6 / 25". This indicates a significant failure in meeting the task requirements.
5.  **Error Message:** The primary error reported is "Server disconnected without sending a response."
6.  **HTTP Request Log:** Despite the "Server disconnected" error, a preceding HTTP POST request appears to have been successful at the HTTP level. The request was made to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` and received an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" status. This suggests that the connection to the proxy/API endpoint was established and returned an OK status, but the subsequent failure ("Server disconnected without sending a response") implies an issue with the response body (e.g., malformed, empty, or unexpected content) or a processing step after the initial HTTP handshake. The `/openai/v1/embeddings` endpoint clearly indicates the task involves interacting with an OpenAI (or compatible) embeddings service, likely for generating text embeddings as part of the sentiment analysis.
7.  **Current Prompt:** The terminal is currently at a PowerShell prompt (`PS`) within a project directory `D:\TPS_Project`.

**Transcriptions:**

```
PROBLEMS OUTPUT TERMINAL PORTS COMMENTS DEBUG CONSOLE
🟡 Running task: Does the statement 'I hate you' have a positive or negative connotation? Reply as a single string containing either 'POSITI
VE' or 'NEGATIVE' in uppercase. Save the result to /data/c5.txt
🔴 C5 failed: Server disconnected without sending a response.
❌ C5 FAILED
🎯 Score: 6 / 25
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
PS D:\TPS_Project> 
```*



**THATS 6/25**

Currently I’m getting a big 0 beacause the github doen’t contain the dockerfile(which it does clearly)  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the results of a "Pre-requisites check," likely an automated validation process for a project submission or setup in a data science course. The results are binary: `1` indicates a pass, and `0` indicates a fail.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The output details the status of several technical requirements related to project repositories and file structures.
*   **Evaluation Method:** Each prerequisite is evaluated as either passed (1) or failed (0).
*   **Checks Performed and Their Status:**
    1.  **Docker Repository Existence & Public Status:** Checked if a Docker repository exists, is public, and has a timestamp before February 18th. This check **passed**.
    2.  **GitHub Repository Existence & Public Status:** Checked if a GitHub repository exists, is public, and has a timestamp before February 18th. This check **passed**.
    3.  **GitHub Repository License File:** Verified the presence of either a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file in the GitHub repository, specifically requiring an MIT License. This check **passed**.
    4.  **GitHub Repository Dockerfile:** Checked for the existence of a `Dockerfile` within the GitHub repository. This check **failed**.
*   **Overall Outcome:** Three out of four prerequisites were met successfully. The user needs to address the missing `Dockerfile` in their GitHub repository to pass all checks.
*   **Context:** The checks involve common tools and practices in software development and data science projects: Docker for containerization and GitHub for version control and collaboration, including licensing and project structure. The timestamp requirement suggests a deadline for setting up these repositories.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages (exactly as they appear):**

```
Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1
Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0
```*



Hopping to get a response from you guys,  
Thanks a lot(wrote this much for first time for any course)

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)  
(i have already made a rookie mistake in my dockerfile otherwise i would have got 9/25 but keeping that aside please let me get 6/25)

*April 06, 2025, 14:10 UTC*
Good evening sir.

My original project evaluation conducted by IITM gave me 7/20, however the new evaluation gave me 0/20.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an evaluation log for a student (ID `23f1002223`) from a data science course at IIT Madras, indicated by the filename `23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`. The log details the execution and outcomes of several automated tasks, specifically showing failures for "B9" and "B10", and concludes with a total score.

Here's a breakdown of the key information, with exact transcriptions of code, commands, and error messages:

---

**Overall Context:**
*   The log is from an automated evaluation system, likely a grading script for a data science assignment.
*   It primarily shows HTTP requests made to a local server (`localhost:8301`) for running specific tasks (`/run`) and reading output files (`/read`).
*   Each task has a description, an HTTP request, its response, and a final status (pass/fail).
*   The final score is `7 / 20`, indicating that some parts of the assignment were completed successfully (not shown in this snippet), while the displayed tasks (B9, B10) failed.

**Task B9 Analysis:**

*   **Task Description:**
    ```
    Running task: Convert https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Science-at-IIT-Madras/ds-course-materials/main/data/B9_Task_Knifes/2Fd0dd1f61b33d64e29d8bc1372a94ef6a2fee76a9/README.md to `/data/b9.html`
    ```
    *   This task aims to convert a Markdown file (likely `README.md` from a specific GitHub repository path) into an HTML file named `b9.html` and save it in the `/data/` directory.

*   **HTTP Request (Conversion Command):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8301/run?task=Convert+https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FData-Science-at-IIT-Madras%2Fds-course-materials%2Fmain%2Fdata%2FB9_Task_Knifes%252F2Fd0dd1f61b33d64e29d8bc1372a94ef6a2fee76a9%252F2FREDME.md+to+%2Fdata%2Fb9.html
    ```
    *   This is a POST request to the local evaluation server's `/run` endpoint. The `task` parameter contains the URL-encoded command to perform the conversion. Note the `2FREDME.md` which URL-decodes to `/README.md`.

*   **HTTP Response (Conversion Status):**
    ```
    HTTP 200 { "message": "B9 Task 'Convert https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Science-at-IIT-Madras/ds-course-materials/main/data/B9_Task_Knifes%2Fd0dd1f61b33d64e29d8bc1372a94ef6a2fee76a9/README.md' executed successfully" }
    ```
    *   The conversion task *itself* reported success (HTTP 200 OK).

*   **HTTP Request (File Read Attempt):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8301/read?path=/data/b9.html
    ```
    *   Immediately after the conversion, the system attempted to read the newly created `/data/b9.html` file.

*   **Error Message (B9 Failure):**
    ```
    B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html
    ```
    ```
    X B9 FAILED
    ```
    *   Despite the conversion reporting success, the system failed to read the output file. This indicates a potential issue where the file was not actually created, was created in the wrong location, or created with permissions that prevented the evaluation system from accessing it.

**Task B10 Analysis:**

*   **Task Description:**
    ```
    Running task: Run datasette via `uvx datasette /data/tickets.db` in the background on port `8001`. From `tickets` count the number of rows where `type` is `Bronze` and save it to `/data/b10.csv`. Then stop the datasette server.
    ```
    *   This is a multi-step task:
        1.  Start a `datasette` server (using `uvx datasette /data/tickets.db`) in the background on port `8001`.
        2.  Query the `tickets` table within the `datasette` instance to count rows where the `type` column is `Bronze`.
        3.  Save this count to `/data/b10.csv`.
        4.  Stop the `datasette` server.

*   **HTTP Request (Task Execution Command):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8301/run?task=Run+uvx+datasette+%2Fdata%2Ftickets.db+in+the+background+on+port+8001%0AFrom+tickets+count+the+number+of+rows+where+type+is+Bronze+and+save+it+to+%2Fdata%2Fb10.csv.%0AThen+stop+the+datasette+server.
    ```
    *   Another POST request to the local server's `/run` endpoint, with the entire multi-line instruction URL-encoded in the `task` parameter (`%0A` represents a newline character).

*   **HTTP Response (B10 Failure):**
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    { "detail": "HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=+%22Bronze%22 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fa26027c8e0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))" }
    ```
    *   The `POST` request to execute the B10 task immediately failed with an `HTTP 400 Bad Request`.
    *   The `detail` provides the root cause: an `HTTPConnectionPool` error, specifically `Errno 111 Connection refused` when trying to connect to `localhost:8001`.
    *   This indicates that the `datasette` server, which was supposed to be started on port 8001, either failed to start, didn't start quickly enough, or wasn't accessible at that address when the system attempted to query it. The query URL `/ticket-sales.csv?sql=...` suggests an attempt to query data from the datasette server.

*   **HTTP Request (File Read Attempt):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8301/read?path=/data/b10.csv
    ```
    *   The system still attempted to read the expected output file `/data/b10.csv`, even though the task execution had already failed.

*   **Error Message (B10 Failure):**
    ```
    B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv
    ```
    ```
    X B10 FAILED
    ```
    *   As expected, the file could not be read because the preceding `datasette` operation failed to produce it.

**Final Score:**
```
Score: 7 / 20
```
*   The student achieved 7 out of 20 points, implying that other tasks (not shown in this log snippet) were either partially or fully successful.*



This was from the official evaluation sir, could you kindly look into it.

did everything as mentioned i got 7/25 but in mail i got 2 which is bonus?  
i know i didn’t add flask in docker it was my mistake but can we just for once neglect that. pleaseeeeeeeee



> **Image Content:** *As an expert in analyzing data science course forum screenshots, here's a detailed breakdown of the provided image:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The user is operating in a PowerShell (PS) terminal on a Windows machine (`C:\Users\choud\OneDrive\Desktop\tds1\TDS_Project_1>`). This suggests they are working on a local development setup.
2.  **Course/Project Context:** The directory `TDS_Project_1` and the nature of the errors (HTTP requests, file reading, API calls, and a score system) strongly indicate this is part of a data science course assignment or project involving web services and potentially AI/ML model integration (given the OpenAI embeddings call).
3.  **Core Problem (C5 Failure):** The primary issue highlighted is the failure of "C5" (likely "Check 5" or "Criterion 5" of an automated grading system). This failure is directly attributed to the inability to read a file: `/data/c5.txt`.
    *   **HTTP Error:** A `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` resulted in an `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` response. This means the local server running on port 8000 could not find the specified file at the given path.
    *   **Application Error:** The message "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" confirms that the application or testing script explicitly failed on this file read operation.
4.  **Grading Status:** The current score is **7 / 25**. This indicates that while some parts of the assignment might be working, a significant portion (including C5) has failed, leading to a low score.
5.  **Successful Operation:** A subsequent `POST` request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. This is crucial because it confirms that:
    *   The application can successfully make external network requests.
    *   It can communicate with an OpenAI embeddings API (or a proxy to it), suggesting that the AI/ML integration part of the project might be correctly implemented or configured.
    *   The failure of C5 is specific to the local file reading mechanism, not a general network or API issue.

**Exact Transcriptions:**

```
}
HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
🔴 C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt
❌ C5 FAILED
🎯 Score: 7 / 25
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
PS C:\Users\choud\OneDrive\Desktop\tds1\TDS_Project_1> 
```*

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

Hi [@Abhay222](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/abhay222)

Docker image submitted by you doesn’t exists.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum perspective, focusing on the key information and exact transcriptions:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform/Context:** The user is on **Docker Hub (`hub.docker.com`)**, a cloud-based registry service that allows users to find, store, and manage Docker container images. This suggests the user is likely working with Docker containers as part of their data science workflow (e.g., pulling pre-built environments, deploying applications).
2.  **User's Intended Action:** The URL and breadcrumbs indicate the user was attempting to access a specific Docker repository and view its tags (versions).
    *   The URL `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags` shows an attempt to view the tags for a repository named `version1` under the user or organization `abhay227`.
    *   The breadcrumb navigation `Explore / abhay227 / version1` further confirms this intended path.
3.  **Problem Encountered:** The user received a **"404 Not Found" error**. This is a standard HTTP status code indicating that the server could not find the requested resource.
4.  **Implication for Data Science Workflow:** For a data science context, a 404 on Docker Hub typically means:
    *   The Docker image repository `abhay227/version1` either does not exist, is misspelled, or has been deleted.
    *   The repository might be private, and the user is not logged in or does not have the necessary permissions to view it.
    *   There might be a typo in the URL or the repository name being sought.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **URL:** `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags`
*   **Breadcrumbs:** `Explore / abhay227 / version1`
*   **Error Code:** `404`
*   **Error Message (Headline):** `Oops!`
*   **Error Message (Description):** `The page you have requested was not found`
*   **Search Bar Hint:** `Ctrl+K`
*   **Buttons in Header:** `Sign in`, `Sign up`*

Hi [@23f1000879](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1000879)

This basically tells you didn’t validate docker Dockerfile and docker image by building and running them, otherwise you would have corrected the mistake.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays information about a specific Docker image tag, likely from a Docker registry interface (e.g., Docker Hub). It provides details essential for identifying, using, and understanding the image.

Here's the key information:

*   **Tag:** The specific version of the image is identified as `version1`.
*   **Last Pushed:** The `version1` tag was last pushed "about 1 month" ago by the user `abhay227`.
*   **Digest:** The unique identifier for this image layer/manifest is `4db729a03f74`. This is the content-addressable ID for the specific image referenced by the tag.
*   **OS/ARCH:** The image is built for `linux/amd64` architecture, meaning it's compatible with Linux operating systems running on AMD64 (x86-64) processors.
*   **Last Pull:** The image was last pulled "about 1 month" ago.
*   **Compressed size:** The compressed size of the image is `261.98 MB`.

**Docker Pull Command:**

The screenshot also provides the exact command to pull this specific image tag:

```
docker pull abhay227/tds_project:version1
```*



  
but it is available under version1.

repo that you submitted through google form was different then this one.

Your Gform response



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot depicts a web interface, likely a data management or submission tracking system, for a data science course, possibly at IIT Madras. It shows a list of student project submissions.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

*   **Interface Type:** The top bar with "Preview", "Code", "Blame" tabs, and file metadata ("1069 lines (1069 loc) • 127 KB") suggests a file viewer, similar to what you might find on GitHub for viewing large CSVs or text files, or a custom course management system. The "Preview" tab is active, meaning the content is displayed in a formatted, readable way.
*   **Search Functionality:** A prominent search bar allows users to filter the displayed data.
*   **Data Content:** The main area of the screen is a table with columns capturing specific details about student projects.
    *   **Columns:**
        *   `Timestamp`: The date and time of the submission or record entry.
        *   `Email Address`: The student's email ID.
        *   `What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?`: A direct question indicating a requirement for students to submit their project code via GitHub.
        *   `What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?`: Another direct question, implying students are required to containerize their projects and publish them on DockerHub.
*   **Specific Entry (Row 919):** An example entry is visible, likely for a student with an IIT Madras email ID, detailing their submission for Project 1.
*   **Context:** The email domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` clearly points to a data science study program at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). The nature of the questions (GitHub repository, DockerHub image) indicates a practical, project-oriented course curriculum focusing on modern data science or software development practices. The future date (2/16/2025) for the timestamp might suggest this is a test entry or from a system set up for a future academic session.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, followed by a transcription of the visible code, commands, and error messages.

---

### Key Information Description

The screenshot displays an evaluation log for a data science course, indicated by the filename `23f1000879@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`. It details the execution and results of several tasks (B7, B8, B9, and B10), with an overall final score of **8 out of 20**, suggesting that many tasks failed or were incomplete.

Here's a breakdown of each task's status:

*   **Task B7 Failed:** The task involved reading an image file (`/data/b7.png`), but the system reported an "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" error, meaning the file could not be located, and consequently, it "cannot identify image file".
*   **Task B8 Failed:** The failure for B8 is attributed to a programming error: "not all arguments converted during string formatting". This typically points to an issue with a format string lacking sufficient arguments or having type mismatches.
*   **Task B9 Partially Succeeded but Ultimately Failed:**
    *   The first part of Task B9 successfully executed a "Convert" operation, transforming a `README.md` file from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/.../README.md`) into HTML and saving it to `/data/b9.html`. This step received an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" success message.
    *   However, the subsequent attempt to read the newly created `/data/b9.html` file failed with an "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" error, stating "Cannot read /data/b9.html". This indicates a potential issue where the file was saved in an inaccessible location or was not properly persisted for subsequent reading.
*   **Task B10 Failed:**
    *   Task B10 aimed to run a `datasette` server (`uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001`), query a database for the count of "Bronze" type tickets, save the result to `/data/b10.csv`, and then stop the server.
    *   The execution of this task resulted in an "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request". The detailed error message, "`Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused`" for `localhost:8001`, clearly indicates that the `datasette` server either failed to start or was not reachable.
    *   Consequently, the final step of reading `/data/b10.csv` also failed with an "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" error, as the file was likely never created due to the datasette server connection issue.

The log concludes with a final `HTTP Request: POST` to an `aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` endpoint for "embeddings" which received a "200 OK", suggesting a successful system-level logging or data submission operation unrelated to the student's task failures.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag `"abhay227/version1"` instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is `4db729a03f74`, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.  
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays the results of a "Pre-requisites check," likely for a project, assignment, or submission within a data science course. The header clarifies that '1' signifies a pass, and '0' signifies a fail. All items listed show a '1', indicating that all prerequisites have been successfully met. The checks cover the following aspects:

1.  **Repository Existence and Visibility:** Both a Docker repository and a GitHub repository must exist and be public. There's also a timestamp requirement, indicating they should have been created or last updated before February 18th.
2.  **GitHub Repository Content:**
    *   A `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file must exist within the GitHub repository, specifically mentioning an MIT License.
    *   A `Dockerfile` must exist within the GitHub repository.

The output suggests a successful completion of all required preparatory steps for a task involving Docker and GitHub.

---

**Transcription:**

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1*



Hi, all my pre-requisites have been fulfilled, and the evaluation logs say I have a score of 10/25. But I have gotten a score of 0, saying ‘Task A module missing’. This is a kind request to confirm the scores.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Google Sheet titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs," which appears to be a log of errors encountered during the evaluation of "Project 1" (P1) for a data science course. The sheet is in "View only" mode, suggesting it's a shared resource for review rather than collaborative editing.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The document serves as a centralized log for technical issues or errors encountered by students during the automated or manual evaluation of their "Project 1" submissions.
2.  **User Identification:** Column A, labeled "email," contains unique identifiers for students, likely in the format `studentID@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This indicates students from IIT Madras's data science (ds.study) program. The `23f` prefix in the student IDs (e.g., `23f100049`) might denote the academic year and perhaps batch (e.g., 2023 Fall).
3.  **Error Descriptions:** Column B contains concise descriptions of the errors encountered for each student's submission. These errors are highly technical, indicative of programming, deployment, or environment setup issues.
4.  **Common Error Themes:** A quick scan reveals several recurring issues:
    *   **Missing Modules:** Many entries indicate `<module_name> module missing` (e.g., `taskA module missing`, `app module missing`, `flask module missing`, `openai module missing`, `PhaseA module missing`). This is a common Python-related error, suggesting issues with dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt` not correctly specified or installed), incorrect file structure, or typos in module names.
    *   **Syntax Errors:** At least one clear syntax error is logged.
    *   **Environment/Configuration Issues:** `.env file missing` points to missing environment variables crucial for application setup.
    *   **Deployment/Containerization Issues:** A significant error related to Docker container networking (`Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)`) indicates problems with container configuration that prevent external access.
    *   **Tooling Issues:** `npx not found` suggests that a specific Node.js package executor tool, likely used in a setup or test script, was not available in the environment.
    *   **Application State Observation:** `application running on 5000 port` is not an error but an observation, possibly indicating that while the application started, it might not have passed subsequent tests or reached the expected state for evaluation.
5.  **Context:** The errors point to a project that likely involves Python programming (Flask, OpenAI), possibly Node.js components (npx), and definitely Docker for deployment/evaluation, suggesting a practical, hands-on data science project with a focus on application development and deployment.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The screenshot displays a Windows File Explorer window, specifically showing the contents of a compressed ZIP file.
*   **File Being Viewed:** The user has opened a ZIP archive named `23f1001524 - docker_logs.zip`.
*   **File Location:** This ZIP file is located in the user's `Downloads` directory.
*   **User Action:** The user has attempted to search *within* the opened `docker_logs.zip` file for the string `23f1001524` using the search bar at the top right of the File Explorer window.
*   **Observed Outcome/Problem:** The search within the ZIP archive returned "No items match your search." This indicates that there are no files or folders *inside* `docker_logs.zip` that contain the string `23f1001524` in their names.
*   **Potential Issue/Implication:** The filename itself (`23f1001524 - docker_logs.zip`) contains the search term. It appears the user might be expecting to find content *inside* the ZIP file that matches the string in the ZIP's *own filename*. If the ZIP is meant to contain logs specific to `23f1001524`, it's unexpected that a search for that string *within* the archive yields no results. This could mean the archive is empty, the relevant files within it are named differently, or the search is being performed incorrectly (e.g., case sensitivity, or looking for content rather than filenames).
*   **Relevance to Data Science Course:** The file name `docker_logs.zip` strongly suggests this archive contains log files from Docker containers. Docker is a fundamental tool for deploying and managing applications, including data science models and services. Analyzing Docker logs is a common task in troubleshooting, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of containerized applications in data science and MLOps contexts. The "23f1001524" likely represents a student ID, project identifier, or specific versioning.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (exactly as they appear):**

*   **File Name (from title bar and address bar):** `23f1001524 - docker_logs.zip`
*   **File Path (from address bar):** `Downloads > docker_logs.zip`
*   **Search Query (from search bar):** `23f1001524`
*   **Status/Error Message:** `No items match your search.`*



  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot, focusing on key information for a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The screenshot displays a Windows File Explorer window. The user is currently viewing the contents of a compressed (ZIP) file.
2.  **File Location:** The ZIP file, named `evaluation_logs.zip`, is located within the user's "Downloads" folder. This suggests the file was recently downloaded, likely as part of a course assignment, dataset, or output from an evaluation process.
3.  **File Purpose (Inferred):** The file name `evaluation_logs.zip` strongly suggests it contains log files or results from an evaluation process, which is highly relevant in data science for monitoring model performance, debugging, or analyzing experiment outcomes.
4.  **Current View/Problem:** The main content area of the File Explorer is currently empty of items, displaying the message: "No items match your search."
5.  **Active Search:** Crucially, there is an active search term in the search bar (top right) within the `evaluation_logs.zip` view. The search term is "23f1001524". This indicates the user is attempting to find specific files or folders *within* the ZIP archive that contain this string.
6.  **Potential Issue:** The "No items match your search" message means that no entries inside `evaluation_logs.zip` contain "23f1001524" in their name. This does **not** necessarily mean the ZIP file is empty. The user might need to clear the search term to see all the actual contents of the archive.
7.  **Available Action:** The "Extract all" button is prominently displayed, indicating the user has the option to decompress the archive to access its contents directly.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **File Path/Breadcrumbs:** `Downloads > evaluation_logs.zip`
*   **File Name (as seen in tab):** `23f1001524 - evaluation_logs.z` (Note: The `.z` might be a display truncation or a less common variant, but context implies a `.zip` file.)
*   **Search Term (in File Explorer search bar):** `23f1001524`
*   **Status/Error Message:** `No items match your search.`
*   **Action Button Text:** `Extract all`*



I cannot find my docker\_logs nor evaluation\_logs and nor anything on the forms . The mail I got says that i received 0 in project tasks but clearly my project is not evaluated. Please look into this. during earlier evaluation i got 7 marks but this time it is 0.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated project evaluation report from a data science course, providing a detailed breakdown of a student's submission, prerequisite checks, and final scores.

Here's the key information:

**1. Overall Context & Grading Formula:**
*   The report is for a project submission (likely "P1").
*   The final `t score` calculation is based on: `MIN (20, (task score + bonus))`.

**2. Submission Details:**
*   **Github repo submitted:** `https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1`
*   **Docker repo submitted:** `veershah1231/tdsproject1final`

**3. Pre-requisites Check (1 for pass, 0 for fail):**
All pre-requisites passed, indicating the submission met the basic requirements for evaluation:
*   `Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`
*   `Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`
*   `Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1`
*   `Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1`

**4. Task Scores Breakdown:**
The project's functional tasks were evaluated, but all scored 0. This is represented in three tables:
*   **Table A (A1-A10):**
    *   A1: 0
    *   A2: 0
    *   A3: 0
    *   A4: 0
    *   A5: 0
    *   A6: 0
    *   A7: 0
    *   A8: 0
    *   A9: 0
    *   A10: 0
*   **Table B (B1-B10):**
    *   B1: 0
    *   B2: 0
    *   B3: 0
    *   B4: 0
    *   B5: 0
    *   B6: 0
    *   B7: 0
    *   B8: 0
    *   B9: 0
    *   B10: 0
*   **Table C (C1-C5):**
    *   C1: 0
    *   C2: 0
    *   C3: 0
    *   C4: 0
    *   C5: 0

**5. Summary Scores:**
*   `Your task score is: 0`
*   `Your bonus is: 1`
*   `Your P1 score is: 1`

**6. Important Note Regarding Logs and Evaluation:**
This section provides a crucial explanation for the task score of 0.
*   `We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.`
*   `You will only have an evaluation log if your API service actually started working within 5 minutes. Otherwise you will have only a docker log.`

**Conclusion:**
The student (`veershah1231`) successfully submitted their project and passed all pre-requisites. However, the core functionality of their project (likely an API service) did not start or become responsive within the allocated 5-minute window for evaluation. This resulted in a "task score" of 0 for all individual components (A, B, C series). The student did receive a "bonus" of 1 and their "P1 score" is 1. The implication for the student is to review their Docker logs to diagnose why their API service failed to start up within the required time, as this directly impacted their task score.*

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.

Could you rerun the test ?

*April 06, 2025, 15:16 UTC*
Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:

```
bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

[Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment:

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

Kind regards

You can take it up with [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Kindest regards.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be a log or output from an automated evaluation system for a data science course, showing the results of several tasks or tests (B9, B10). The student's submission seems to have encountered errors, resulting in a low score.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Status:**
*   The overall score is 7 / 20.

**Task B9 Analysis:**
*   **Initial Request:** `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8369/read?path=/data/b9.html "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`
    *   This indicates an attempt to read a file named `b9.html` from `/data/` via an HTTP GET request to `localhost` on port `8369`.
    *   The server responded with "404 Not Found", meaning the file was not found at the specified path.
*   **Error Message:** `B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html`
*   **Result:** `X B9 FAILED`
    *   Task B9 failed because the system could not read the expected HTML file.

**Task B10 Analysis:**
*   **Task Description:**
    `Running task: Run datasette via 'uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001' in the background.`
    `From 'tickets' count the number of rows where 'type' is "Bronze" using http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22Bronze%22`
    `and save it to /data/b10.csv.`
    `Then stop the datasette server.`
    *   This task involves starting a `datasette` server on port 8001, querying a database (`ticket-sales.db`) for a count of "Bronze" type tickets, saving the result to `b10.csv`, and then stopping the server.

*   **POST Request (Attempt to run task):**
    `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8369/run?task=Run+datasette+via+%60uvx+datasette+%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales.db+--port+8001%60+in+the+background.%0AFrom+%60tickets%60+count+the+number+of+rows+where+%60type%60+is+%22Bronze%22using%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8001%2Fticket-sales.csv%3Fsql%3DSELECT%2BCOUNT%28%2A%29%2BFROM%2Btickets%2BWHERE%2Btype%3D%2522Bronze%2522%0Aand+save+it+to+%2Fdata%2Fb10.csv.%0AThen+stop+the+datasette+server.%0A "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"`
    *   This is a URL-encoded POST request to `localhost:8369/run` to execute the described datasette task.
    *   The server responded with "400 Bad Request", indicating an issue with the request itself.

*   **HTTP 400 Error Detail:**
    `HTTP 400 {`
    `"detail": "HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22Bronze%22 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7c9f911c0b60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))"`
    `}`
    *   The detailed error explains that the `HTTPConnectionPool` (likely from `urllib3`) failed to connect to `localhost:8001`.
    *   Specifically, it reports `[Errno 111] Connection refused`. This strongly suggests that the datasette server, which was supposed to be running on port 8001, either failed to start, crashed, or was not accessible when the system tried to query it.

*   **GET Request (Attempt to read result):**
    `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8369/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`
    *   After the failed attempt to run the datasette task, the system tried to read the expected output file `b10.csv`.
    *   As the task likely failed to generate the file, the server responded with "404 Not Found".

*   **Error Message:** `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv`
*   **Result:** `X B10 FAILED`
    *   Task B10 failed because the system could not read the expected CSV file, likely due to the upstream datasette server connection issue.

**Final Successful Request (unrelated to B9/B10 failures):**
*   `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
    *   This indicates a successful POST request to an OpenAI embeddings API proxy, which seems to be a separate component of the evaluation system, perhaps for grading or logging purposes.*



  
Respected Sir,  
see the above image its from the scores we got from mail just before the latest one, in that I had got 7/20 and now new mail shows I got 0?? how is this possible…  
the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : [23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\_evaluation.log - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNVy9KSfSITZg_KGLF2_wwLWjzNl8mb5/view)

*   "We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites."
*   "You will only have an evaluation log if your API service actually started working within 5 minutes. Otherwise you will have only a docker log."

**Key Insights and Interpretation:**

*   **Successful Setup, Failed Execution:** The student successfully set up their GitHub and Docker repositories, included necessary files (LICENSE, Dockerfile), and submitted them on time, as indicated by all prerequisites passing.
*   **Zero Task Performance:** Despite passing prerequisites, the core task (reflected by the table values and "Your task score is: 0") did not function correctly, resulting in zero points for the main assignment.
*   **Bonus Impact:** A bonus of `1` point was awarded. This bonus appears to be the sole contributor to the final "P1 score" of `1`, as the task score was `0`.
*   **Reason for Failure (Implied):** The note about logs is critical. Since the task score is `0` and an evaluation log is only provided if the API service started within 5 minutes, it strongly suggests that the student's API service failed to start within the given time limit. This would explain why all task-related evaluations resulted in `0`. The student would likely only have the "docker log" to troubleshoot the issue.*

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:  
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker\_logs.zip or evaluation\_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
and nor do i find my id in the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs so please help sir  
Thank you

Here's the key information:

*   **Current Location:** The user has navigated to and opened a ZIP file located at `This PC > Downloads > docker_logs.zip`. This suggests the user is attempting to access or examine log files related to Docker, which is a common tool used in data science for creating reproducible environments.
*   **Active Search Filter:** In the search bar at the top right, there is an active search query: `23f2001390`.
*   **Observed Content:** The main content area shows the message: `No items match your search.`. This indicates that the ZIP archive either contains no files, or more likely, no files within the archive match the active search query `23f2001390`.
*   **Expected Content (Implied):** Given the filename `docker_logs.zip`, the user likely expects to find log files generated by Docker containers or processes inside this archive.
*   **Preview Pane:** The right-hand pane is the preview pane, displaying `Select a file to preview.`, as no file is currently selected (because none are displayed).

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **File Path/Navigation Bar:** `This PC > Downloads > docker_logs.zip`
*   **Search Query:** `23f2001390`
*   **Informational Message:** `No items match your search.`
*   **Prompt in Preview Pane:** `Select a file to preview.`*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a Windows File Explorer window, showing the contents of a `.zip` archive.

### Key Information:

1.  **Location and File Being Inspected:** The user has navigated to their `Downloads` folder and is currently viewing the contents of a compressed (ZIP) file named `evaluation_logs.zip`. This suggests the file likely contains logs or results related to an evaluation process, common in data science for tracking model performance, experiment runs, or script outputs.
2.  **Active Search:** A search query `23f2001390` is entered in the search bar within the `evaluation_logs.zip` archive. This string appears to be a specific identifier (e.g., a unique run ID, model ID, or user ID) that the user is looking for within the log files.
3.  **Search Result:** The main file display area shows the message "No items match your search.", indicating that no files or folders within the `evaluation_logs.zip` archive have names containing "23f2001390".
4.  **Preview Pane Status:** The right-hand pane displays "Select a file to preview.", which is the default message when no file is selected or available for preview.
5.  **Context for a Data Science Course Forum:** This image suggests a user might be encountering an issue where they expect to find specific evaluation logs (identified by "23f2001390") within a provided ZIP file, but the search is not yielding any results. Potential reasons could include:
    *   The target files are named differently.
    *   The identifier is *within* the file content, not its name (requiring extraction and text search).
    *   The `evaluation_logs.zip` file is empty or corrupted, or the specific logs are genuinely missing.
    *   The user is searching in the wrong directory or an outdated version of the archive.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   **File Path (Address Bar):** `This PC > Downloads > evaluation_logs.zip`
*   **Search Query:** `23f2001390`
*   **Displayed Message:** `No items match your search.`

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Google Sheet titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs," which appears to be a compilation of errors encountered by students during an evaluation process, likely for "Project 1" (p1) in a data science course. The sheet is in "View only" mode, suggesting it's a shared log for review.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Purpose:** The log tracks specific errors (`error_reason`) encountered by individual students, identified by their `email` address. This is crucial for identifying common failure points in student submissions or the evaluation setup itself.
2.  **Structure:**
    *   **Column A: `email`** - Contains the unique email ID of the student, primarily in the format `[studentID]@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
    *   **Column B: `error_reason`** - Describes the specific error or issue that occurred during the evaluation of that student's submission.
3.  **Common Error Themes:**
    *   **Missing Modules:** A very high frequency of errors indicates missing Python modules (e.g., `taskA`, `requests`, `functions`, `app`, `nest_asyncio`, `whisper`, `flask_cors`, `phaseA`). This is the most prevalent issue, suggesting dependency management problems (e.g., incorrect `requirements.txt`, virtual environment setup issues, or missing installations in the evaluation environment).
    *   **File/Path Issues:** Errors related to files or directories not being found (`app.py`, `uv.`). This points to problems with the expected file structure or executable paths within the submission.
    *   **Container/Networking Issues:** Specific errors related to Docker container binding and port accessibility (`Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)`), and applications running on specific ports (`application running on 5000 port`). This indicates challenges with containerization setup or network configuration for the evaluation.
    *   **Syntax Errors:** A fundamental coding error (`SyntaxError: unmatched ']'`).
    *   **Script Usage:** A message indicating the correct usage of a script, which might imply students are running it incorrectly.

This log is highly valuable for course administrators or instructors to diagnose systemic issues with the evaluation environment or provide targeted feedback and resources to students based on the most common error types.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

*   `requests modue missing`
*   `application running on 5000 port`
*   `functions module missing`
*   `Usage: /app/start.sh <email>`
*   `/bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv.: not found`
*   `app module missing`
*   `nest_asyncio module missing`
*   `whisper module missing`
*   `taskA module missing`
*   `SyntaxError: unmatched ']'`
*   `taskA module missing` (repeated multiple times)
*   `flask_cors module missing`
*   `error: Failed to spawn `app.py`, Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)`
*   `Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)`
*   `phaseA module missing`*

i also not found anything in this form , but i got mail to score=0  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Google Sheet titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs," which serves as a log of errors encountered during an evaluation phase (likely "Project 1" or "Phase 1") for a data science course. The sheet is in "View only" mode, suggesting it's for review or analysis rather than direct editing by forum users.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The sheet aggregates error messages from student project evaluations, indicated by student email addresses in Column A and corresponding error descriptions in Column B.
*   **Participants:** The email addresses in Column A (e.g., `23f2001286@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) suggest students from IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) enrolled in a Data Science program.
*   **Error Categories:** The errors fall into several common categories for data science projects, indicating issues with:
    *   **Missing Modules/Dependencies:** Many errors indicate that required Python modules (e.g., `taskA`, `pydub`, `flask`, `PhaseA`, `pytesseract`) are not found. "taskA" and "PhaseA" appear to be project-specific modules.
    *   **Import Issues:** Problems importing main application modules or specific components from utility modules.
    *   **Docker/Containerization Configuration:** Critical errors related to Docker container networking, specifically binding to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) instead of `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces), preventing external access to port 8000. This is a common issue when deploying applications within containers that need to be accessed from outside the container's host.
    *   **Syntax Errors:** Basic coding mistakes like unterminated string literals.
    *   **Missing System Libraries:** Errors related to core system libraries (`libGL.so.1`), often needed by image processing or graphical libraries.
    *   **Python Version Incompatibility:** Students using a Python version (e.g., 3.12.9) that is newer than what the project's dependencies or evaluation environment supports (e.g., `only versions >=3.6, <3.10 are supported`).

**Transcribed Error Messages (from Column B, rows 89-111):**

*   **Row 89:** `taskA module missing`
*   **Row 90:** `pydub module missing`

Hi Hari,

Your docker failed to build.

Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in

[Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that
> import requests
> import pandas
> DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")
> url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
> try :
> response = requests.get(url,headers=github\_headers, timeout=60)
> fetch\_commit = None
> if response.status\_code == 200:
> commits = response.json()
> for commit in commits:
> sha = commit["sha"]

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

Thats why there are no logs.  
Kind regards

We cannot allow changes to repos. This is a blanket rule for everyone. No exceptions. Since the only way to get your project to work is to make changes to it, we cannot score you for changes.

Kind regards

Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.

What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Most common reason for during running docker image was `taskA module was missing` which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

This is error that you got while building docker image using docker file in your github repo tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

In your Dockerfile you are trying to copy requirements.txt but it doesn’t exists in the directory where Dockerfile is located

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

```

here u can see it installs using pip install …

here it’s requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for AIPROXY\_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git doesn’t allow upload of `.env` file I couldn’t upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY\_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because`.env` file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the `.env` file so it didn’t build so I had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports both`.env` file and environment variable one)

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an evaluation log from a data science course, likely for a programming or data manipulation assignment. It details the steps taken by an automated grading system, the tasks it attempted, and the resulting successes or failures, along with specific error messages. The overall score indicates a low performance.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**General Information:**
*   **Source:** The log file is `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`, suggesting it's from an evaluation system at an IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) domain.
*   **Evaluation Context:** The log shows the execution of specific tasks (labeled B9, B10) and checks for their outcomes, culminating in a score.

**Task B9 Analysis:**
*   **Status:** Failed.
*   **Error Message 1:**
    ```
    B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html
    ```
*   **Error Message 2:**
    ```
    X B9 FAILED
    ```
*   **Related HTTP Request (context from above the crop):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8369/read?path=/data/b9.html "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
    ```
*   **Conclusion for B9:** Task B9 required the system to read a file named `/data/b9.html`. The grading system attempted to retrieve this file via an HTTP GET request to `localhost:8369`, but the file was not found, resulting in a "404 Not Found" error. This led to B9 being marked as failed.

**Task B10 Analysis:**
*   **Task Description (Intended Action):**
    ```
    Running task: Run datasette via `uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001` in the Background. From `tickets` count the number of rows where `type` is `Bronze` using `http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze%22` and save it to `/data/b10.csv`. Then stop the datasette server.
    ```
    *   **Explanation:** The student was required to:
        1.  Start a `datasette` server with the `/data/ticket-sales.db` database on port `8001` in the background.
        2.  Execute an SQL query (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type = 'Bronze'`) against this datasette instance via its CSV API.
        3.  Save the result of this query to `/data/b10.csv`.
        4.  Stop the datasette server.

*   **Execution Command (HTTP POST Request by Grading System):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8369/run?task=Run+datasette+via+%60uvx+datasette+%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales.db+--port+8001%60+in+the+background.%0AFrom+%60tickets%60+count+the+number+of+rows+where+%60type%60+is+%60Bronze%2522%0Ausing%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8001%2Fticket-sales.csv%3Fsql%3DSELECT%2BCOUNT%28%2A%29%2BFROM%2Btickets%2BWHERE%2Btype%2B%3D%2B%2522Bronze%2522%0Aand+save+it+to+%2Fdata%2Fb10.csv.%0AThen+stop+the+datasette+server. "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"
    ```
    *   **Error Message for B10 Execution:**
        ```
        HTTP 400 { "detail": "HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze%22 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7c9f911c0b60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))" }
        ```
    *   **Analysis of B10 Execution Error:** The grading system attempted to execute the multi-step B10 task. The core issue is that it failed to connect to `localhost` on `port 8001`. The specific error `[Errno 111] Connection refused` indicates that nothing was listening on that port, or a firewall blocked the connection. This strongly suggests the `datasette` server was either not started successfully by the student's script/command, or it crashed/stopped immediately after starting.

*   **Verification Command (HTTP GET Request by Grading System):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8369/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
    ```
    *   **Error Message for B10 Verification:**
        ```
        B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv
        ```
        ```
        X B10 FAILED
        ```
    *   **Analysis of B10 Verification Error:** Since the `datasette` connection failed, the SQL query could not be executed, and consequently, the `/data/b10.csv` file was never created or populated. When the grading system tried to read this file, it received a "404 Not Found" error, leading to B10 being marked as failed.

**Overall Score:**
*   **Score:**
    ```
    Score: 7 / 20
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** The student received a score of 7 out of a possible 20 points, indicating significant issues with the assigned tasks, as both B9 and B10 (which appear to be major components) failed due to file not found and connection refused errors, respectively.

**Other HTTP Request (Likely unrelated to student tasks/errors):**
*   **Successful Request:**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
    ```
    *   **Analysis:** This is a successful HTTP POST request to an AI proxy endpoint, possibly for generating embeddings. This appears to be a background operation of the grading system itself or an unrelated process, as it returned "200 OK" and is not associated with any failure in the displayed logs.*

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) ,

I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays output from a terminal, likely from an automated grading or testing system within a data science course. It shows the results of HTTP requests and a score.

**Key Information:**

*   **Failed Test Case (C5):** The primary issue is the failure of a component or test labeled "C5".
    *   An `HTTP GET Request` to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` resulted in an `"HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"`.
    *   The specific error message confirms the problem: "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt". This indicates the local server encountered an error trying to access or read the specified file `/data/c5.txt`. This could be due to incorrect file path, missing file, or permission issues.
*   **Successful API Call:** Another part of the system successfully made an API call.
    *   An `HTTP POST Request` to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returned an `"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` status. This suggests that the part of the code responsible for interacting with an external AI service (likely related to OpenAI embeddings) is working correctly.
*   **Overall Score:** The student or system achieved a "Score: 9 / 25". This indicates a significant portion of the assignment or task was not completed successfully, likely due in part to the "C5" failure.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"
C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

*April 07, 2025, 10:16 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot depicts a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, configured with a dark theme, showing the successful cloning of a Git repository.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Left Panel (File Explorer / Sidebar):**
*   **Root Folder:** `llmagent` is visible and appears to be the newly cloned repository, as it matches the name of the repository cloned in the terminal.
*   **Files within `llmagent`:**
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `readme.md`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`
*   **Inference:** The presence of Python files (`.py`), a `Dockerfile`, and specifically `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, strongly suggests this is a data science or machine learning project, possibly related to Large Language Models (LLMs) given the "llmagent" name.

**2. Middle Panel (Main Editor Area):**
*   **Current View:** It shows the VS Code "Start" screen, offering options like "New File", "Open File", "Open Folder", and "Clone Git Repository". This indicates the user has just opened VS Code or hasn't opened any specific file yet after the cloning operation.
*   **Recent Projects:** The "Recent" section lists "llmagent-3bb328b23e3749a0117aa393731a49758a5708d", confirming the `llmagent` project was recently accessed or cloned into `C:\Users\USER\Dow...` (likely `Downloads`).

**3. Bottom Panel (Integrated Terminal):**
*   **Active Tab:** "TERMINAL" is the active tab, indicating the user is interacting with the command line. Other tabs like "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", and "PORTS" are available.
*   **Shell:** The prompt `PS C:\Users\USER\Downloads\New folder (33)>` indicates that **PowerShell** is being used as the terminal shell.
*   **Current Directory:** The operation was performed in `C:\Users\USER\Downloads\New folder (33)`.
*   **Executed Command:** The user successfully ran a `git clone` command.

**4. Right Panel (Walkthroughs):**
*   **Content:** This panel displays "Walkthroughs" such as "Learn t..." (likely "Learn more" or "Learn the basics"), "GitHub", and "Get Sta..." (likely "Get Started"). This is a standard VS Code onboarding or discovery feature.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows a user's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, actively engaged in a development workflow for a project named "llmagent," likely a large language model (LLM) related application.

Here's the key information:

**User Environment & Setup:**
*   **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is being used.
*   **Operating System:** PowerShell prompt (`PS C:\Users\USER...`) indicates a Windows environment.
*   **Project Location:** The current working directory is `C:\Users\USER\Downloads\New folder (33)`.
*   **Project Name:** The main project directory is `llmagent`.

**Project Structure & Files:**
*   The `llmagent` directory contains several Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a `Dockerfile` (suggesting containerization), `LICENSE`, and a `readme.md`.
*   A `.env` file is present and currently selected/open in the editor. The `U` next to it in the Explorer panel indicates it is an untracked file (i.e., not yet added to Git's version control). This is common for `.env` files as they often contain sensitive information.

**Editor Content:**
*   The `.env` file contains a single environment variable: `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. This suggests the project interacts with an AI proxy service or API that requires authentication.

**Terminal Activity:**
*   The `TERMINAL` tab is active.
*   The user successfully executed a `git clone` command.
*   The terminal output shows the standard messages of a successful Git repository clone operation.

> **Image Content:** *As an expert at analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a detailed description of the key information presented:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) interface, indicating an active development environment. The user is working on a Python project, likely related to data science or AI, given the file names and code content.

1.  **Project Structure:**
    *   The left "EXPLORER" pane shows a folder named `lmagent` (likely a typo for `llmagent`, hinting at Large Language Model Agents).
    *   Inside this folder, several Python files are visible: `app.py`, `datagen.py` (listed twice, possibly a duplicate or symlink), `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`.
    *   Other project files include `.env` (for environment variables), `Dockerfile` (for containerization), `LICENSE`, and `readme.md`.
    *   The `evaluate.py` file is currently selected in the file explorer and open in the editor. The `.env` file is also listed as open in "OPEN EDITORS."

2.  **`evaluate.py` Script Context:**
    *   The active file in the editor is `evaluate.py`.
    *   Comments at the top of the file provide metadata for the script:
        *   It `requires-python` version `>=3.13`.
        *   It lists several `dependencies` that are crucial for the project's functionality: `faker`, `httpx`, `lxml`, `numpy`, `pillow`, and `python-dateutil`. These dependencies suggest tasks like synthetic data generation (`faker`), HTTP requests (`httpx`), XML/HTML parsing (`lxml`), numerical operations (`numpy`), image processing (`pillow`), and robust date/time handling (`python-dateutil`).

3.  **Code Functionality (Imports & Variables):**
    *   The script imports a comprehensive set of standard Python libraries (`sys`, `hashlib`, `httpx`, `io`, `json`, `logging`, `numpy`, `os`, `random`, `re`, `subprocess`), indicating a wide range of tasks from system interaction to data manipulation and process management.
    *   Specialized imports include `parse` from `dateutil.parser` for date parsing, `fromstring` from `lxml.html` for HTML parsing, and `Image` from `PIL` (Pillow) for image processing.
    *   A significant part of the script involves importing multiple functions from a local module named `datagen` (presumably `datagen.py`). These functions (`get_markdown`, `get_dates`, `get_contacts`, `get_logs`, `get_docs`, `get_email`, `get_credit_card`, `get_comments`, `get_tickets`) strongly suggest that the project heavily relies on generating diverse types of synthetic data for testing or evaluation purposes.
    *   The presence of `openai_api_key` and `gemini_api_key` variables at the bottom of the visible code (even if truncated) is a critical indicator. It implies that this project interacts with large language models from OpenAI and Google (Gemini), likely for tasks such as generating responses, evaluating outputs, or interacting with agent-based systems that use these models. This reinforces the "lmagent" (LLM Agent) hypothesis.

added the new `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` from the mail, trying to replicate the test environment  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, common in data science and software development workflows, showing a project structure and the content of an active file.

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** The user is working in a VS Code-like integrated development environment (IDE) with a dark theme.
2.  **Project Structure (Explorer Panel):**
    *   The project root folder is named `llmagent`. This name suggests a focus on Large Language Models (LLM) or an agent built around LLMs.
    *   The folder contains several files and sub-folders:
        *   `.env`: A file likely used for environment variables. It has a `U` status indicator, typically meaning "Untracked" or "Unstaged" in Git, indicating it's new or modified and not yet committed.
        *   `app.py`: The main Python application file, currently open and active.
        *   `datagen.py`: A Python file, possibly for data generation. It has an `M` status indicator, meaning "Modified" in Git.
        *   `Dockerfile`: A configuration file for building Docker images, indicating the project can be containerized.
        *   `evaluate.py`: A Python file, likely for evaluating models or data. It also has an `M` status indicator.
        *   `LICENSE`: A file containing the project's software license.
        *   `readme.md`: A Markdown file, typically providing project documentation and setup instructions.
        *   `tasksA.py`: A Python file, likely containing tasks or functions related to "Task A".
        *   `tasksB.py`: A Python file, likely containing tasks or functions related to "Task B".
3.  **Active File:** The `app.py` file is currently selected in the Explorer and open in the editor panel.
4.  **File Content (`app.py`):** The `app.py` file contains only commented-out lines. It appears to be a list of project dependencies. The structure `dependencies = [` suggests that this list might be intended to be uncommented and used, perhaps for installation or as a reference. The comments `/// script` and `///` might denote custom sections or markers within the file.
5.  **Dependencies Listed:** The commented-out list includes various Python libraries relevant to data science, web development, and general utilities:
    *   `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
    *   `fastapi`: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
    *   `uvicorn`: An ASGI server for FastAPI and other asynchronous web applications.
    *   `python-dateutil`: For parsing and manipulating dates/times.
    *   `pandas`: A fundamental library for data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `db-sqlite3`: Appears to be a reference to SQLite database interaction (though `sqlite3` is built-in to Python, this might indicate a specific wrapper or a note).
    *   `scipy`: A library for scientific computing, building on NumPy.
    *   `pybase64`: For Base64 encoding/decoding.
    *   `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
    *   `httpx`: A modern, async-compatible HTTP client library.
    *   `markdown`: For working with Markdown.
    *   `duckdb`: An in-process SQL OLAP database management system.

moved the new `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py` into the project folder



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, specifically demonstrating the successful Dockerization of a Python application named `llmagent`.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Project Structure (VS Code Explorer Panel):**
The left-hand sidebar shows the file structure of a project located in `C:\Users\User\Downloads\New folder (33)\llmagent`. Key files indicate a Python-based application:
*   `.env`: Likely contains environment variables.
*   `app.py`: The main application script, currently open in the editor.
*   `datagen.py`: Suggests data generation capabilities.
*   `Dockerfile`: Crucial for defining the Docker image build process.
*   `evaluate.py`: Implies an evaluation component, common in data science/ML projects.
*   `LICENSE`, `readme.md`: Standard project documentation.
*   `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`: Additional Python scripts, possibly for specific tasks or workflows.

**2. Application Dependencies (app.py editor):**
The `app.py` file, though mostly commented out, lists a series of Python dependencies. This gives insight into the application's functionality:
*   `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
*   `fastapi`, `uvicorn`: Indicate a web API built with FastAPI, served by Uvicorn.
*   `python-dateutil`: For date/time parsing.
*   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   `db-sqlite3`: For SQLite database interaction.
*   `scipy`: For scientific computing.
*   `pybase64`: For base64 encoding/decoding.
*   `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from `.env`.

**3. Docker Build Process (Terminal Panel):**
The primary activity shown is a successful Docker image build.

*   **Command Executed:**
    ```
    docker build -t llm-agent .
    ```
    This command initiates a Docker build, tagging the resulting image as `llm-agent` and using the current directory (`.`) as the build context (where the `Dockerfile` is located).

*   **Build Output and Steps (Detailed):**
    The output shows a successful build (`FINISHED` in 5.9 seconds) and reveals the steps defined in the `Dockerfile`:
    *   `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`: The image is based on a slim Python 3.12 image, optimized for size.
    *   `apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates`: System packages are updated, and `curl` along with `ca-certificates` (for secure connections) are installed.
    *   `ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh && RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh`: The `uv` installer script (a fast Python package manager) is downloaded, executed, and then removed.
    *   `pip install ...`: A large number of Python packages are installed, including those listed in `app.py`'s comments and additional ones like `httpx`, `markdown`, `duckdb`, `faker`, and `pillow`. This suggests a broad range of functionalities, from web services to data processing, database interaction (DuckDB), and potentially image manipulation (Pillow) and synthetic data generation (Faker).
    *   `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   `COPY *.py /app/`: Copies all Python files (`.py`) from the build context into the `/app` directory in the container.
    *   `COPY .env /app/`: Copies the `.env` file into the `/app` directory in the container.
    *   The build successfully creates an image with SHA256 hash `fb34f25e6111f02b5247d2c47a065db05054eff59ff72ce05d20e0baa178717` and tags it as `llm-agent`.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, likely used by a student in a data science or programming course. It shows the file explorer, an open `.env` file, and a terminal output detailing the execution of an evaluation script, including errors and successes.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. VS Code File Explorer (Left Panel):**
*   **Root Folder:** `New folder (33)`
*   **Project Folder:** `llmagent`
*   **Files/Folders within `llmagent`:**
    *   `_pycache_` (a Python bytecode cache directory)
    *   `.env` (environment variables file, currently open in the editor, marked `U` for uncommitted changes)
    *   `app.py` (another Python file, open in an editor tab)
    *   `datagen.py` (data generation script, marked `M` for modified)
    *   `Dockerfile` (likely for containerization with Docker)
    *   `evaluate.py` (the main evaluation script, marked `M` for modified)
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `readme.md`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`

**2. Editor Panel (Center):**
*   **Currently Open File:** `.env`
*   **Content of `.env`:**
    ```
    AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJHbgciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6IkIwIHRvbWF6IHVwMCIsImFwaV91cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5vcGVuYWkuY29tLyIsInByb2plY3RfaWQiOiJsYW5nZ2VuZSIsImF1dGhvcml6YXRpb25fYXJndW1lbnRzIjp7fSwicm9sZXMiOlsibW9kZWwiXSwiZGF0YV9kaXJlY3RvcnkiOiIvZGF0YSIsImRhdGFzZXRSIjoiZGF0YSIsImRhdGFzZXRfZmlsZXMiOiJkYXRhZmlsZS50eHQifSwiaWF0IjoxNzAyMzgwNjcwLCJleHAiOjE3MDMyMzgwNjcwLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5zdHVkeS5paXRtLmFjLmluIn0.MFOFvD2AwbFhpaVtd5X2LGzEIdgCmJ0aRy1qWt5Y2RE
    ```
    This appears to be a long base64-encoded token, possibly a JSON Web Token (JWT), used for authentication with an AI proxy service.

**3. Terminal Panel (Bottom):**
*   **Active Tab:** `TERMINAL`
*   **Current Directory:** `C:\Users\USER\Downloads\New folder (33)\llmagent`
*   **Commands and Output (Chronological Order):**

    1.  **Command Executed:**
        ```bash
        uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
        ```
        *   This command initiates the evaluation process using `uv` (a fast Python dependency resolver and executor). It passes an email, a token counter, and an external port as arguments to `evaluate.py`.

    2.  **Running Task (Initial Setup/Datagen):**
        ```
        🟡 Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/s_anand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a%2Fraw%2F1324669808795e1942179856aafda466052b66ae/datagen.py` with `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` as the only argument
        ```
        *   This yellow alert indicates a task being performed by `evaluate.py` which involves potentially installing `uv` and executing a `datagen.py` script from a GitHub Gist URL, passing the student's email as an argument.

    3.  **HTTP Request (POST - Failed):**
        ```
        HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=%0AInstall+%60uv%60+if+required%29+and+run+the+script+%60https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fs_anand0%2Ff19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a%2Fraw%2F1324669808795e1942179856aafda466052b66ae%2Fdatagen.py%60With+%6023f2001390%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in%60+as+the+only+argument%0A "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"
        ```
        *   The evaluation script made an HTTP POST request to a local server running on port 8000. The `task` parameter in the URL is URL-encoded.
        *   **Error:** The request returned `HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request`.

    4.  **Error Detail for HTTP 400:**
        ```
        🔴 HTTP 400 {
          "detail": "name 'HTTPException' is not defined"
        }
        ```
        *   This is a critical error message. The `400 Bad Request` was accompanied by a JSON response indicating a Python `NameError`: `'HTTPException' is not defined`. This suggests an issue in the server-side Python code (likely `app.py` or a module it uses), where `HTTPException` was referenced but not properly imported or defined.

    5.  **HTTP Request (GET - Successful):**
        ```
        HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
        ```
        *   Another HTTP request was made, this time a GET request to read a file `/data/format.md`.
        *   **Success:** This request returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, indicating that the server could successfully serve this file. This suggests the server itself is running, but the previous POST request failed due to an application-level coding error.

    6.  **Task A1 Status:**
        ```
        ✅ A1 PASSED
        ```
        *   Indicates that a test or task named "A1" successfully completed.

    7.  **Task A2 Status (Failed):**
        ```
        🔴 A2 failed: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
        ❌ A2 FAILED
        ```
        *   This is another critical error. Task "A2" failed.
        *   **Error:** `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`. This is a common operating system error on Windows, meaning the program attempted to access a file or directory that does not exist at the specified path.

    8.  **Running Task (Description of next task):**
        ```
        🟡 Running task: `/data/datefile.txt` has list of dates, one per line.
        Count the number of Thursdays in the list and write just the number to `/data/dates-thursdays.txt`
        ```
        *   This yellow alert describes the objective of a subsequent task (likely what A2 was trying to achieve). It involves processing a file named `datefile.txt` and writing results to `dates-thursdays.txt`. The `WinError 2` for A2 likely relates to one of these files or the `/data` directory not being found.

**Key Issues Identified:**
*   **Server-side `NameError`:** The `HTTPException` not defined error for the POST request points to a missing import or definition in the backend Python code (`app.py` or a related module).
*   **File Not Found for Task A2:** The `[WinError 2]` indicates that a file required for Task A2 (likely `datefile.txt` or `dates-thursdays.txt`, or the `/data` directory itself) was not found. This could be due to the `datagen.py` script failing to create it, incorrect paths being used (e.g., pathing discrepancies between host OS and a container if Docker is involved), or the file simply not existing.*



  
running the evaluate.py using:

```
 uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a VS Code environment, specifically focusing on the file explorer, an open `.env` file, and a terminal output showing the results of running tests or tasks within a data science project.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### **1. Project Environment & Files:**

*   **Project Name:** `llmagent` (visible in the file explorer and terminal prompt). This suggests the project is likely related to Large Language Models (LLMs) or agents interacting with them.
*   **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
*   **Open File:** `.env` is open in the main editor panel. This file is typically used for environment variables.
*   **Files in Project:**
    *   `.env` (Modified/Untracked - indicated by `U` beside it)
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py` (Modified - `M`)
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py` (Modified - `M`)
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `readme.md`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`
    *   The presence of `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `tasksA/B.py` strongly indicates a machine learning or data science project involving data generation, model evaluation, and structured tasks. `Dockerfile` suggests containerization for deployment.

### **2. Environment Variable:**

*   The `.env` file contains an `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. This is likely an API key or token for authenticating with an AI proxy service.
    *   `AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJhbgcIOiiUIUZiINij9.eyJlbWfpbCI6IjIjjwMDEZOTBZMUC3R1ZkhkuWl0bs5hYy5pbiJ9.MFOFvd2AwbfhpAVtd5X` (truncated)

### **3. Terminal Output Analysis:**

The terminal displays the results of running automated tasks, with several failures and one success.

*   **Task C4 Failure:**
    *   **Status:** `X C4 FAILED`
    *   **Task Description:** `Running task: Does the statement 'I hate you' have a positive or negative connotation? Reply as a single string containing I VE in uppercase. Save the result to /data/c5.txt`
        *   *Note:* "I VE" seems like a typo for "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" based on the context.
    *   **HTTP Request (POST):**
        *   **Command:** `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Does+the+statement+%27I+hate+you%27+have+a+positive+or+negative+connotation%3F+Reply+as+a+single+string+containing+either+%27POSITIVE%27+or+%27NEGATIVE%27+in+uppercase.+Save+the+result+to+%2Fdata%2Fc5.txt "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"`
        *   **Analysis:** A POST request was made to a local server running on `localhost:8000` at the `/run` endpoint. The entire task description, including the instruction to save the result, was URL-encoded and passed as a `task` query parameter. The server responded with `HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request`, indicating a client-side error, often due to a malformed request or invalid parameters.
    *   **Error Details (HTTP 400):**
        *   **Message:** `HTTP 400 { "detail": "No connection adapters were found for 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,NEGATIVE'" }`
        *   **Analysis:** This is the critical error message for C4. It suggests that the application or server tried to interpret `data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,NEGATIVE` as a URL to connect to, rather than as a literal string or data. This likely indicates a misinterpretation or incorrect parsing of the task instruction "Save the result to /data/c5.txt" by the `localhost:8000/run` endpoint, causing it to attempt to "connect" to the data string "NEGATIVE" as if it were a network resource. It implies a fundamental issue in how the server is expected to handle the output or the `task` parameter itself.

*   **Subsequent HTTP Request (GET):**
    *   **Command:** `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
    *   **Analysis:** Despite the C4 failure, a GET request was successfully made to read from `/data/c5.txt`. This implies that either the `400 Bad Request` didn't prevent some form of data from being written, or `c5.txt` might have existed with content from a previous run.

*   **Task C5 Failure (Result Comparison):**
    *   **Status:** `X C5 FAILED`
    *   **File Checked:** `🔴 /data/c5.txt`
    *   **Expected Result:** `⚠EXPECTED: NEGATIVE`
    *   **Actual Result:** `⚠RESULT: [('NEGATIVE',)]`
    *   **Analysis:** The test expected the plain string `NEGATIVE`. However, the content read from `/data/c5.txt` was `[('NEGATIVE',)]`, which is a list containing a tuple containing the string. This is a format mismatch, leading to the C5 failure. This likely stems from the issue in C4 where the server may have incorrectly wrapped the sentiment string.

*   **Overall Score:**
    *   `Score: 6 / 25` - Indicates that the tasks are largely failing.

*   **Successful External API Call:**
    *   **Command:** `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
    *   **Analysis:** A POST request to an external OpenAI embeddings service (via a proxy) was successful. This indicates that the system's ability to communicate with external AI services, likely using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, is functional and not the cause of the previous failures.

*   **Terminal Prompt:**
    *   `PS C:\Users\USER\Downloads\New folder (33)\llmagent>` - Confirms the user's current directory is the `llmagent` project folder, using PowerShell.

### **Summary of Key Issues:**

1.  **C4 Failure (Primary Problem):** The `localhost:8000/run` endpoint is failing to correctly process the `task` parameter, specifically the instruction to "Save the result to /data/c5.txt". The server misinterprets a data string (`data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,NEGATIVE`) as a connection string, leading to a `400 Bad Request` error. This suggests a bug in the API's parsing logic or its internal handling of file saving instructions.
2.  **C5 Failure (Secondary Problem, Consequence of C4):** Even if some output was written to `/data/c5.txt`, its format (`[('NEGATIVE',)]`) does not match the expected plain string (`NEGATIVE`). This indicates an issue with how the sentiment result is formatted and saved by the application.
3.  **Successful External API:** The successful call to `aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` confirms that general network connectivity and external API integration are working, ruling them out as the source of the `localhost` issues.
4.  **Overall Performance:** The low score (6/25) confirms significant issues with the current task implementation.

The user needs to debug the `localhost:8000/run` endpoint, specifically how it parses and executes the `task` parameter and saves the result to a file, ensuring the correct data format.*

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a view of a GitHub repository page, likely from a data science course forum given the context, providing an overview of a specific project.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Identification:**

*   **Owner/Organization:** `Sharmilecholan/`
*   **Repository Name:** `tds_project1`
    *   *Interpretation:* "tds_project1" strongly suggests "The Data Science Project 1" or "Team Data Science Project 1," indicating this is an assignment or a component of a data science curriculum.

**2. Repository Status Metrics:**

*   **Contributors:** `1`
    *   *Interpretation:* The project currently has only one contributor, likely the owner "Sharmilecholan." This suggests it's either a solo project or a very new team project in its initial stages.
*   **Issues:** `0`
    *   *Interpretation:* There are no open issues (bugs, feature requests, tasks) reported for this repository.
*   **Stars:** `0`
    *   *Interpretation:* The repository has not received any stars from other GitHub users, indicating it hasn't gained public recognition or appreciation yet.
*   **Forks:** `0`
    *   *Interpretation:* No other GitHub users have forked this repository, meaning no one has copied it to their own account to contribute or develop independently.

**3. Visual Elements:**

*   **Primary Logo (Top Right):** A purple, pixelated "H" shape within a rounded light grey square.
    *   *Interpretation:* This is likely a custom user avatar for "Sharmilecholan" or potentially a specific logo associated with the course or platform if it's a branded environment.
*   **GitHub Logo (Bottom Right):** A subtle grey GitHub Octocat logo is visible, confirming the platform.
*   **Interface:** The overall layout, fonts, and icons are consistent with a standard GitHub repository overview page. A blue bar is visible at the very bottom, typical for GitHub's footer/navigation.

**4. Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

There are no direct code snippets, command-line instructions, or error messages present in this screenshot. The transcribed text primarily consists of the repository identifier and project metrics.

**Summary:**

The screenshot provides a concise overview of a newly created or very early-stage GitHub repository named "tds_project1," owned by "Sharmilecholan." Its metrics (1 contributor, 0 issues, 0 stars, 0 forks) strongly suggest it's a personal project or a fresh academic assignment within a data science course, yet to see significant collaboration, issues, or public attention.*

Contribute to Sharmilecholan/tds\_project1 development by creating an account on GitHub.

I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.  
Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.

### Post #412 by **Devanshi ** (ds-students)
*April 07, 2025, 13:37 UTC*
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir, i want to clarify about this. I had got 9/20 in the previous mail in my evaluation log and now the recent mail say i got 1 mark. I want to ask about this. Please help me  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a series of steps and their outcomes from a data science course environment, likely an automated grading or task execution system. The user is attempting to perform a data extraction and analysis task, which is failing at multiple stages.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **User/Environment Context:** The top bar shows `22f3000276@ds.s...`, indicating a user ID or session on a data science platform (`ds.s...` possibly for "data science system").
2.  **Task B9 Objective:**
    *   Start a `datasette` server on port `8001` using the database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` in the background.
    *   Query this `datasette` instance to count the number of rows from the `tickets` table where the `type` column is "Bronze". This query is specified as `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type="Bronze"`.
    *   Save the result of this query to a CSV file at `/data/b10.csv`.
    *   Stop the `datasette` server.
3.  **Task Execution Mechanism:** The system appears to interpret natural language instructions (like the B9 objective) and send them as a URL-encoded `task` parameter to an internal HTTP endpoint (`http://localhost:8134/run`).
4.  **Failure Point (B9):** The `POST` request to execute Task B9 results in an `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error` with a cryptic detail: `{"detail": "'filename'"}`. This strongly suggests an issue during the file saving step or with the specified path.
5.  **Consequence (B10):**
    *   Because B9 failed and the file `/data/b10.csv` was not created, a subsequent `GET` request to `http://localhost:8134/read?path=/data/b10.csv` (likely an attempt to verify or retrieve the output) results in an `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` error.
    *   This leads to `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv`.
6.  **Overall Score:** The user's current score is `9 / 20`, indicating that several tasks might have passed, but B9 and B10 (and potentially others) have failed.
7.  **Final Communication:** A successful `POST` request to an AI proxy (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`) with a `200 OK` status suggests that the system communicates with an external service, possibly for logging, evaluation, or embedding generation based on the task description or output.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated evaluation report for a data science project, likely submitted as part of a course or challenge. It outlines the project's adherence to submission requirements, its functional performance, and the resulting scores.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the key information:

**1. General Context & Scoring Philosophy:**
*   The report clarifies that "(outliers do not influence the scores)", indicating a robust evaluation methodology.
*   The `final t score` calculation is explicitly defined: `MIN (20, (task score + bonus))`. This means the maximum possible `t score` is 20, even if the sum of `task score` and `bonus` exceeds 20.

**2. Submitted Repositories:**
*   **Github repo submitted:** `https://github.com/anshiraj07/TDS-Project-1-2025`
*   **Docker repo submitted:** `22f3000276/task-agent`

**3. Pre-requisites Check (Status: All Passed):**
Each prerequisite is checked, with `1` indicating a pass and `0` a fail. All listed prerequisites have passed for this submission.
*   `Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`
*   `Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`
*   `Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1`
*   `Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1`

**4. Task Performance Scores:**
These tables represent the scores obtained for various sub-tasks or test cases. All recorded scores are `0`.
*   **A-series tasks:**
    *   `A1: 0`
    *   `A2: 0`
    *   `A3: 0`
    *   `A4: 0`
    *   `A5: 0`
    *   `A6: 0`
    *   `A7: 0`
    *   `A8: 0`
    *   `A9: 0`
    *   `A10: 0`
*   **B-series tasks:**
    *   `B1: 0`
    *   `B2: 0`
    *   `B3: 0`
    *   `B4: 0`
    *   `B5: 0`
    *   `B6: 0`
    *   `B7: 0`
    *   `B8: 0`
    *   `B9: 0`
    *   `B10: 0`
*   **C-series tasks:**
    *   `C1: 0`
    *   `C2: 0`
    *   `C3: 0`
    *   `C4: 0`
    *   `C5: 0`

**5. Summary Scores:**
*   `Your task score is: 0` (This aggregates the zeros from the A, B, C series tasks).
*   `Your bonus is: 1` (A bonus point was awarded).
*   `Your P1 score is: 1` (Likely the preliminary score based on prerequisites met, and possibly including the bonus, but not the functional task score).

**6. Log and Debugging Information:**
*   The system attaches `docker logs` and `evaluation logs` for those who passed prerequisites.
*   **Critical note:** `You will only have an evaluation log if your API service actually started working within 5 minutes. Otherwise you will have only a docker log.`
    *   Given the `task score is: 0`, it's highly probable the API service did *not* start working within the 5-minute window, meaning the student likely only received `docker logs` and not `evaluation logs`. This is a key diagnostic clue for the student.
*   For self-diagnosis, the files `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` (used for tasks) are shared, with a strong recommendation to replicate the test environment to debug issues.

**Summary of Student's Performance:**
The student successfully met all the initial submission prerequisites (Github, Docker, LICENSE, Dockerfile). However, their core task performance was `0`, indicating that the deployed API service either failed to start, ran into an immediate error, or did not correctly perform the required functions during the evaluation. Despite a bonus point, the functional aspect of the project was not successful. The provided logs (likely only docker logs) and shared evaluation scripts are crucial for the student to diagnose and fix the issues.*

*   **Context:** The interface is a table-like view, possibly from a database or a web application, designed for monitoring submissions for "Project 1" in a data science course.
*   **Search/Filter:** The system is currently filtered, showing results for `22f2000559`.
*   **Student Identity:** The entries belong to a single student identified by the email address `22f2000559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email format (`ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) suggests an association with an IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) online or distance learning program in Data Science.
*   **Multiple Submissions:** There are two entries for this student, indexed as row `499` and `1060`, implying two distinct submissions or updates to Project 1.
*   **Timestamps:**
    *   The first submission was on `February 15, 2025, at 23:56:09`.
    *   The second submission was on `February 16, 2025, at 23:59:44`. Both are late at night, common for project deadlines.
*   **GitHub Repository:** Both entries point to the same base GitHub repository: `https://github.com/AnushkaAbhishekKumar/LLM-Project`. The second entry is more specific, including `/tree/main`, indicating the link goes directly to the main branch of the repository. This suggests a large language model (LLM) related project.
*   **DockerHub Image:** The student submitted two different DockerHub image names, indicating potentially different versions or builds of their project's Docker image:
    *   `coolsisters7/0c8a207c`
    *   `coolsisters7/4a79a3c81cd0`
    The base repository name `coolsisters7` is consistent, but the image tags (the part after the slash) are distinct, likely representing unique build hashes or version identifiers.

For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has to be Dockerfile.

### Post #421 by **K Senthur Kumaran ** (ds-students)
*April 07, 2025, 14:51 UTC*
Dear [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:

```
python run.py

```

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

[github.com](https://github.com/ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent)

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a comprehensive development and testing scenario for a Python Flask application named `LLM_AUTOMATION_AGENT`. The user is working within VS Code, running a local Flask server, and interacting with it via `curl` commands, while simultaneously viewing the project's GitHub repository.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Project Name:** `LLM_AUTOMATION_AGENT`
2.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** Python (98.7% of the codebase)
    *   **Web Framework:** Flask
    *   **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code
    *   **Virtual Environment:** `venv` is active (`(venv) PS C:\Users\shant\Desktop\LLM_Automation_Agent>`)
    *   **Containerization:** A `Dockerfile` exists, indicating potential for Docker deployment.
    *   **Source Control:** GitHub, with the repository `ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent` open in Chrome.
3.  **Application Purpose:** The Flask application functions as an "LLM Automation Agent API." Its purpose appears to be task execution and file reading, possibly involving Large Language Models for automation.
4.  **API Endpoints (from `main.py`):**
    *   `/` (GET): Root endpoint, returns a welcome message.
    *   `/read` (GET): Takes a `path` query parameter to read a file (`file_path = request.args.get('path')`). **Potential vulnerability: Local File Inclusion (LFI) if `path` is not sanitized.**
    *   `/run` (POST): Executes a task. One specific `execute_task` function is shown, which attempts to extract and save a `credit_card_number` and handles unsupported actions.
5.  **Demonstrated Functionality:**
    *   The Flask server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (and `http://172.17.25.87:8000`).
    *   A `curl` command successfully calls the `/run` endpoint with the task `count wednesdays`.
    *   The API processed this task by counting "Wednesdays" from `data\dates.txt` and returned a success message.
6.  **Development Status:**
    *   The Flask server is explicitly noted as a "development server" with a warning against production use.
    *   The GitHub repository shows a recent commit "Adding all files to GitHub, including untracked app directory" 6 minutes ago, indicating active development.
    *   The project contains common files like `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`.
7.  **Key Files in Project Structure:**
    *   `app/`: Likely contains the core application logic.
    *   `data/`: Contains data files, e.g., `dates.txt` used for the "count wednesdays" task.
    *   `main.py`: Contains the Flask application routes and task execution logic.
    *   `run.py`: Likely the script to start the Flask server.
    *   `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
8.  **Potential Security Concerns:**
    *   The `/read` endpoint, if not properly secured, could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server (LFI).
    *   The `execute_task` function's reference to `credit_card_number` extraction and saving suggests handling of sensitive data, which requires robust security measures.

*April 07, 2025, 15:00 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the breakdown of the key information, commands, and error messages:

### Key Information

1.  **User Environment:** The user is operating as `root` on a machine identified as `tds-course-temp-bq`. The current working directory is `/mnt/sdb/github_approach`, suggesting this is a specific development or deployment environment, possibly a VM or cloud instance.
2.  **Objective:** The user is attempting to run a Python application within a Docker container.
3.  **Docker Image Details:**
    *   The `docker images` command was used to identify a specific image.
    *   **Repository Name:** `22f3002902` (this appears to be a local repository name or an ID being used as a name).
    *   **Tag:** `latest`
    *   **Image ID:** `c739ff8a3247`
    *   **Age:** Built/created 6 days ago.
    *   **Size:** 1.13 GB.
4.  **Docker Container Execution:**
    *   The `docker run` command attempts to start a container from the identified image (`c739ff8a3247`).
    *   **Environment Variable:** It passes an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` into the container, taking its value from the host's `AIPROXY_TOKEN` variable (`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`). This implies interaction with an AI proxy service or similar API.
    *   **Port Mapping:** It maps port `8000` on the host machine to port `8000` inside the container (`-p 8000:8000`), indicating the application is likely a web service or API listening on this port.
5.  **Problem/Error:**
    *   The container fails to start the application with a `python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory` error.
    *   **Diagnosis:** This error originates from *inside* the Docker container. It means that the Python interpreter, which is likely the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` of the Docker image, was instructed to run the script `/app/app/main.py`, but this file does not exist at that location within the container's filesystem.
    *   **Common Causes:** This typically points to an issue in the Dockerfile used to build the image:
        *   The `COPY` command might have an incorrect source or destination path for `main.py`.
        *   The `WORKDIR` in the Dockerfile might be set incorrectly, causing relative paths to fail.
        *   The `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction might be pointing to the wrong path for the Python script.
        *   The `main.py` file itself might not have been included in the build context when `docker build` was run.

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from Docker Hub, showing the details of a specific public repository belonging to the user `coolsisters7`.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. User and Account Details:**
*   **User:** `coolsisters7`
*   **Account Type:** Docker Personal
*   **Repository Limit:** The user is currently "Using 0 of 1 private repositories," implying the viewed repository is public.

**2. Repository Details:**
*   **Repository Name:** `coolsisters7/llm` (The `llm` likely stands for Large Language Model, which is highly relevant to a data science course forum context).
*   **Status:** Public repository (indicated by "Public view" button and the private repository count).
*   **Last Pushed:** Approximately 2 months ago. The specific timestamp shown on hover for the 'latest' tag is `Feb 16, 2025 at 11:51 pm` which appears to be a future date, possibly a placeholder or display error in the UI, but confirms the image was pushed some time ago.
*   **Repository Size:** 795.7 MB
*   **Description/Category:** Not currently set, with options available to add them.
*   **Tabs Available:** General (active), Tags, Image Management (BETA), Collaborators, Webhooks, Settings.

**3. Image Tags Information (under 'General' tab):**
*   **Number of Tags:** This repository contains 1 tag.
*   **Tag Details:**
    *   **Tag:** `latest` (indicated by a green dot)
    *   **OS:** Linux (represented by the penguin icon)
    *   **Type:** Image
    *   **Pulled:** `less than 1 day` ago (meaning the image was very recently pulled by someone, possibly for use in a course assignment or testing).
    *   **Pushed:** `about 2 months` ago (consistent with the overall repository push time).

**4. Docker Commands and Features:**
*   **Docker Push Command:** Instructions are provided to push a new tag to the repository.
    *   `To push a new tag to this repository:`
    *   **Command:** `docker push coolsisters7/llm:tagname`
*   **Docker Scout:** `DOCKER SCOUT INACTIVE` with an `Activate` link, indicating a security scanning feature is available but not enabled.
*   **Docker Build Cloud:** A promotional section for "Build with Docker Build Cloud" to "Accelerate image build times with access to cloud-based builders and shared cache."

**In summary for a data science course context:**
This screenshot shows a user `coolsisters7` managing a Docker image repository named `llm` (likely for Large Language Models). The image is publicly available, was last updated about two months ago, but its `latest` tag was pulled very recently (less than a day ago), suggesting active use. The page provides the exact `docker push` command for adding new versions or tags to this image, which is crucial for students or instructors collaborating on data science projects involving Dockerized environments.*



Oh I see what happened, the image names are different, I don’t know how, given I pushed the latest at 11:51pm and submitted the form at 11:59pm. Thank You [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) for showing me.  
Question: Now that I know. how can I test the container myself, if I want to do exactly what you guys are doing?

### Post #427 by **Mishkat Chougule** (ds-students)
*April 07, 2025, 16:23 UTC*
My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.  
But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.  
Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?

idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, along with the transcribed code:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a GitHub repository interface, specifically showing the contents of a `Dockerfile`.

1.  **Repository Context:** The user is viewing the "Code" section of a GitHub repository. The repository is described as an "Implemented API for automation agent."
2.  **File Structure:** The left sidebar shows the file structure of the repository, which includes:
    *   Folders: `__pycache__`, `data`
    *   Files: `.env`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`.
    *   The `Dockerfile` is currently selected and its content is displayed on the right.
3.  **Dockerfile Details:**
    *   The `Dockerfile` has 30 lines (22 lines of code) and is 910 Bytes in size.
    *   It outlines the steps to build a Docker image for a Python application.
    *   It uses `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as the base image.
    *   It installs system dependencies (like `build-essential`, `gfortran`, `curl`, `ca-certificates`).
    *   It installs `uv` (a fast Python package installer and manager).
    *   It installs Python packages via `pip` including `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `duckdb`, and others, suggesting a data science/API backend application.
    *   It sets the `PATH` environment variable to include `/root/.local/bin`.
    *   It sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the application files, exposes port 8000, and defines the command to start a FastAPI server using Uvicorn.
4.  **GitHub Copilot Integration:** A message "Code 55% faster with GitHub Copilot" is visible, indicating the use or availability of GitHub Copilot for code generation assistance.
5.  **Handwritten Annotation:** There is a handwritten annotation "f s i e n d" or "friend" on the right side of the screenshot, pointing towards the GitHub Copilot message. This is likely a personal note from the user who took the screenshot.

**Transcribed Code/Commands:**

```dockerfile
1   # Use Python 3.12 slim version as base image
2   FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm
3
4   # Install system dependencies required for SciPy and other libraries

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository view, specifically showing the contents of a `Dockerfile` within a project named `TDS_Project_1`. The user has handwritten "mine" with an arrow pointing to the Dockerfile content, indicating their ownership or focus on this particular file.

### Key Information

1.  **Repository Context:** The user is viewing a repository `TDS_Project_1` under the user/organization `23f1000879`. This suggests a project, likely for a course (given "TDS" which could stand for "The Data Science" or similar).
2.  **File System Structure:** The left sidebar shows the project's file structure, which includes:
    *   `_pycache_` (likely Python compiled bytecode)
    *   `data` (suggests data files are part of the project)
    *   `Dockerfile` (currently selected and displayed)
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `README.md`
    *   Several Python files: `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`. This indicates a Python-based application, potentially with data generation, evaluation, and task-specific logic.
3.  **Dockerfile Purpose:** The `Dockerfile` defines the steps to build a Docker image for a Python application. It sets up the environment, installs dependencies, copies application files, and specifies how to run the application.
4.  **Base Image:** The Dockerfile uses `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as its base image, indicating a lean Python 3.12 environment based on Debian Bookworm.
5.  **System Dependencies:** It installs various system libraries commonly required for scientific Python packages (like SciPy) and general utilities (`build-essential`, `gfortran`, `libatlas-base-dev`, `curl`, `ca-certificates`).
6.  **Package Management:**
    *   It installs `uv`, a fast Python package installer, which suggests a modern approach to dependency management.
    *   It then uses `pip install` to install a comprehensive list of Python packages relevant to data science and web development, including: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dateutil`, `requests`, `scipy`, `python-dotenv`, `httpx`, `pandas`, `db-sqlite3`, `pybase64`, `markdown`, `duckdb`.
7.  **Application Setup:**
    *   It sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   It copies all files from the current directory (where the Dockerfile resides) into the `/app` directory within the container.
8.  **Application Execution:**
    *   The Docker image is configured to expose port `8000`.
    *   The final command `CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]` indicates that the Docker container will run a FastAPI application (`app:app`) using `uvicorn`, making it accessible on all network interfaces on port 8000.
9.  **GitHub Copilot Integration:** The text "Code 55% faster with GitHub Copilot" suggests the user might be using or has used GitHub Copilot for code generation or completion.
10. **Commit History:** The commit message "Added Dockerfile" confirms that this Dockerfile was recently added to the repository.

### Post #431 by **Wasim Ansari** (ds-students)
*April 07, 2025, 19:50 UTC*
Dear Sirs,  
[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a set of instructions or requirements for a programming assignment or project, likely from a data science course. The core theme revolves around containerization, API development, and deployment.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Application Containerization:** Participants are required to create a `Dockerfile` to build their application. This indicates the application needs to be packaged and made portable using Docker.
2.  **Public Docker Image Publication:** The resulting Docker image must be published *publicly* to `Docker Hub`. This implies that the solution should be openly accessible for evaluation or use.
3.  **API Service via Podman:** The application, when run inside the container, must function as an API server.
    *   It specifies `podman` as the container runtime, not `docker`, which is a notable detail.
    *   A specific `podman run` command is provided, outlining how the image should be executed:
        *   `--rm`: Ensures the container is removed after it exits.
        *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Passes an environment variable for an AI proxy token, suggesting an authentication or specialized service interaction.
        *   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps host port 8000 to container port 8000, making the API accessible externally.
        *   `$IMAGE_NAME`: A placeholder for the name of the Docker image.
    *   The API is expected to automatically serve two specific endpoints on `http://localhost:8000`:
        *   `/run?task=...`: Implies a task execution or processing endpoint.
        *   `/read?path=...`: Implies a data reading or retrieval endpoint.
4.  **Submission Requirements:** The final step involves submitting project details via a Google Form. The required information includes:
    *   The URL of the GitHub repository containing the project code (e.g., `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`).
    *   The name of the published Docker image (e.g., `user-name/repo-name`).

In summary, this is an assignment detailing the technical steps for building a containerized API application, deploying it publicly, and ensuring its correct functionality and accessibility, along with submission guidelines.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

```
podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
http://localhost:8000/run?task=...
http://localhost:8000/read?path=...
https://github.com/user-name/repo-name
user-name/repo-name
```*



**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent)  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
[https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/blob/main/app/app.py).  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: <https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent>.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

24ds3000090

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum, detailing the key information and transcribing the relevant code, commands, and error messages:

**Key Information:**

The user is encountering `OSError: cannot open resource` errors when their Python script attempts to load font files using the `Pillow` library (specifically `ImageFont.truetype`).

1.  **Initial Setup:** The session successfully downloaded and installed "faker" and 3 other packages. This indicates a setup phase completed without issues.
    ```
    Downloaded faker
    Installed 3 packages in 39ms
    ```

2.  **First Error Traceback:**
    *   **Origin:** The error first occurs in the user's script, `/tmp/datagen66arSL.py`, at line 220, within a function named `a8_credit_card_image`.
    *   **Problem Code:** The specific line causing the error is `large_font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", size=60)`. This suggests an attempt to load a font named "arial.ttf" from a relative path or a default system font directory.
    *   **Underlying Issue:** The traceback shows the call failing deep within the `Pillow` library's font handling (`PIL/ImageFont.py`).
    *   **Error Message:** The ultimate error is `OSError: cannot open resource`. This means the system could not find or access the "arial.ttf" file at the location it was looking.

3.  **Second Error Traceback (During Exception Handling):**
    *   **Context:** The message "During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred" indicates that while the first error was being processed, a second, related error happened. This often points to a fallback mechanism or a subsequent attempt to fix the problem within the script.
    *   **Origin:** This second error occurs in the same user script, `/tmp/datagen66arSL.py`, but is reported as failing at line 303 (likely where `a8_credit_card_image()` was called or a related part of the script), which then leads to a re-attempt at line 224 within the `a8_credit_card_image` function.
    *   **Problem Code (Second Attempt):** The script attempts to load a different font: `large_font = ImageFont.truetype("/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf", size=60)`. This time, it uses an *absolute path* to a common Linux font location for "DejaVuSans.ttf".
    *   **Underlying Issue:** Similar to the first traceback, this also fails within the `Pillow` library's font handling.
    *   **Error Message:** The same error `OSError: cannot open resource` is raised again, indicating that even with the absolute path to "DejaVuSans.ttf", the font could not be opened.

**In Summary:** The core issue is that the Python script, which appears to be generating images (possibly credit card images given the function name), cannot find or access the necessary font files, resulting in `OSError`s. This happens for both a relatively referenced "arial.ttf" and an absolutely referenced "DejaVuSans.ttf". This suggests missing font files on the system, incorrect paths, or permission issues preventing the script from reading them.

---

**Exact Transcription of Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

```
Downloaded faker
Installed 3 packages in 39ms
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/datagen66arSL.py", line 220, in a8_credit_card_image
    large_font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", size=60)

    self.font = core.getfont(
        font, size, index, encoding, layout_engine=layout_engine
    )
OSError: cannot open resource

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/datagen66arSL.py", line 303, in <module>
    a8_credit_card_image()
  File "/tmp/datagen66arSL.py", line 224, in a8_credit_card_image
    large_font = ImageFont.truetype("/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf", size=60)
  File "/root/.cache/uv/environments-v2/ffad51b5c0487eb6/lib/python3.13/site-packages/PIL/ImageFont.py", line 880, in truetype

    self.font = core.getfont(
        font, size, index, encoding, layout_engine=layout_engine
    )
OSError: cannot open resource
```*



I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python script, likely part of a data science course assignment or project.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Script Execution Entry Point:** The script uses the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, indicating that the code within this block will run when the script is executed directly.
2.  **Argument Parsing:** It utilizes the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments.
    *   It defines an argument `email` (positional).
    *   It defines an optional argument `--root` with a default value of `"/data"`.
3.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   It parses the arguments into an `args` object.
    *   It creates a `config` dictionary, storing the provided email and the absolute path of the root directory. This `config` dictionary appears to be used to manage important script parameters.
4.  **Directory Creation:** The script creates the specified `root` directory using `os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)`. The `exist_ok=True` argument prevents an error if the directory already exists.
5.  **Important Disclaimer:** A prominent `print` statement warns the user that "THIS SCRIPT WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE EVALUATION. TREAT THIS AS A GUIDE." This is a crucial piece of information, especially in an educational context, as it advises users not to rely on the current script as the final version for submission or grading.
6.  **Modular Function Calls:** The script proceeds to call a series of functions: `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`, `a4_contacts()`, `a5_logs()`, `a6_docs()`, `a7_email()`, `a8_credit_card_image()`, `a9_comments()`, and `a10_ticket_sales()`. The naming convention (e.g., `a2_`, `a3_`) strongly suggests these are sequentially numbered assignments or modules within a larger project, each handling a specific data processing or analysis task (e.g., markdown formatting, date extraction, contact information, logs, documents, email processing, image analysis for credit cards, comments, and ticket sales data).

**Transcribed Code:**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("email")
    parser.add_argument("--root", default="/data")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    config = {}
    config["email"] = args.email
    config["root"] = os.path.abspath(args.root)

    os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)

    print("DISCLAIMER: THIS SCRIPT WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE EVALUATION. TREAT THIS AS A GUIDE.")
    print("Files created at", config["root"])

    a2_format_markdown()
    a3_dates()
    a4_contacts()
    a5_logs()
    a6_docs()
    a7_email()
    a8_credit_card_image()
    a9_comments()
    a10_ticket_sales()
```*



  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

Hi Haricharan

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.  
This is the error when building it:

```

```



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a section of a Dockerfile, a script used to build Docker images. It outlines instructions for setting up the application environment within a container.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context:** The code is part of a Dockerfile, indicated by commands like `WORKDIR` and `COPY`, which are specific to Docker image building.
2.  **Application Directory Setup:** The first set of commands initializes the working directory inside the Docker container.
3.  **File Copying:** The subsequent commands are responsible for transferring necessary application files from the build context (likely the host machine where the Docker build command is run) into the container's designated application directory.
4.  **Python Application Files:** All files ending with `.py` (Python source code files) are copied.
5.  **Environment Configuration:** A `.env` file, commonly used to store environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings) for an application, is also copied. This is often crucial for application configuration at runtime.
6.  **Highlighted Line:** The line `COPY .env /app/` is explicitly highlighted with an orange box and an arrow, suggesting it is the specific focus of a question, discussion, or instruction within the data science course forum. This might indicate a common point of error, a security consideration, or a specific configuration step being emphasized.

**Transcribed Code/Commands:**

```
# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/
```*



This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards

Your container failed to run after building it.

```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

```

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

There is **clearly** *some difference* between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

### Post #438 by **Swati Kapoor** (ds-students)
*April 08, 2025, 08:52 UTC*
Hi,

Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is an evaluation report for a data science course project, likely "project1_final", based on a student's submission to GitHub and Docker Hub.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Final Score Calculation Formula:**
The final score, referred to as "t score", is capped at 20.
`Your final t score calculation is based on`
`MIN (20, (task score + bonus))`

**2. Repository Submissions:**
*   **Github repo submitted:** `https://github.com/swati-iitm/project1_final`
*   **Docker repo submitted:** `swatiiiitm/project1_final`

**3. Pre-requisites Check (1 for pass, 0 for fail):**
All pre-requisites for the submission have been met.
*   `Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`
*   `Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`
*   `Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1`
*   `Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1`

**4. Component Scores (Likely task-specific grading):**
These tables show individual component scores, where `1` indicates a pass and `0` indicates a fail for that specific component.

*   **Table A:**
    *   A1: 1
    *   A2: 0
    *   A3: 0
    *   A4: 0
    *   A5: 1
    *   A6: 0
    *   A7: 0
    *   A8: 0
    *   A9: 0
    *   A10: 0
    *   *(Total for A: 2)*

*   **Table B:**
    *   B1: 0
    *   B2: 0
    *   B3: 1
    *   B4: 0
    *   B5: 0
    *   B6: 0
    *   B7: 0
    *   B8: 0
    *   B9: 0
    *   B10: 0
    *   *(Total for B: 1)*

*   **Table C:**
    *   C1: 0
    *   C2: 0
    *   C3: 0
    *   C4: 0
    *   C5: 0
    *   *(Total for C: 0)*

**5. Final Calculated Scores:**
*   **Your task score is: 3**
    *   (This matches the sum of the component scores from Tables A, B, and C: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3)
*   **Your bonus is: 0**
*   **Your P1 score is: 4**
    *   *Note on P1 Score:* Based on the "final t score" formula (MIN(20, task score + bonus)), the t-score would be MIN(20, 3 + 0) = 3. The "P1 score" being 4 suggests it might be a raw score before some normalization or an unstated additional component (e.g., perhaps a point for passing all prerequisites, or a different scoring metric for "P1" versus "t score"). If it includes a point for successfully meeting all pre-requisites (3 task score + 1 pre-req point = 4 P1 score), this would reconcile it.*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub repository page, likely for a student's final project in a data science course, named "project1_final".

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Repository Overview:**
*   **Repository Name:** `project1_final`
*   **Visibility:** `Public`
*   **Watchers:** `1` (This could be the instructor or a fellow student.)
*   **Forks/Stars:** `0` (Typical for a course project not widely adopted.)
*   **License:** `MIT license`

**2. Branch and Commit Status:**
*   **Current Branch:** `master`
*   **Number of Branches:** `2 Branches` (implies there is at least one other branch, likely `main`).
*   **Branch Sync Status:** `This branch is 8 commits ahead of main .`
    *   This is a critical piece of information. It indicates that the `master` branch contains 8 changes (commits) that are not present in the `main` branch. In a course setting, this might mean the student needs to merge their `master` branch into `main` for submission, or that `main` is an older, unupdated version.
*   **Latest Commit:**
    *   **Committer:** `swati-iitm`
    *   **Commit Message:** `last_minut` (likely "last minute", suggesting a rushed or final update)
    *   **Commit Hash (short):** `7d08160`
    *   **Commit Time:** `2 months ago` (This indicates the project hasn't been actively worked on recently).
    *   **Total Commits:** `9 Commits`

**3. Repository Contents (Files and Directories):**
*   **`_pycache_` (directory):** A standard Python cache directory, indicating Python code is present.
*   **`data` (directory):** This strongly suggests the project involves data, a core component of data science.
*   **`Dockerfile` (file):** Indicates the project is containerized (e.g., using Docker), which is crucial for reproducible environments in data science and MLOps. The commit message for this file is `updated, relative path`.
*   **`LICENSE` (file):** Standard open-source license. The commit message is `Initial commit`.
*   **`app.py` (file):** Often the main application entry point, possibly a web application or API. The commit message is `last_minut`.
*   **`datagen.py` (file):** Likely a script for generating or processing data. The commit message is `updated relative path`.
*   **`evaluate.py` (file):** A script dedicated to evaluating models or results, a key part of machine learning/data science projects. The commit message is `version_latest`.
*   **`llm_code.py` (file):** This is a highly significant file name. "LLM" stands for Large Language Model, indicating that the project specifically involves or utilizes Large Language Models, which is a very current and advanced topic in data science and AI. The commit message is `last_minut`.

**4. About Section (Right Sidebar):**
*   **Description:** `No description, website, or topics provided.` (The repository lacks a summary description).
*   **Releases:** `No releases published`
*   **Packages:** `No packages published`

**Summary for a Data Science Course Forum:**
This GitHub repository is a `public` `final project` (`project1_final`) by a user `swati-iitm`. The project was last updated `2 months ago` with `last_minut` commits, suggesting it was completed or submitted around that time. Crucially, the `master` branch is `8 commits ahead of main`, which could be a point of confusion or an action item for the student (e.g., merge to `main`).

The file structure strongly indicates a data science project:
*   `data` folder for datasets.
*   `evaluate.py` for model assessment.
*   `Dockerfile` for environment reproducibility.
*   Most notably, `llm_code.py` confirms the project deals with Large Language Models, a common topic in advanced data science courses. `app.py` and `datagen.py` suggest an application that uses and potentially generates data for the LLM.*

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

* Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
* when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
* for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
* after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
* As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
* after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
* just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

```

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment

```
docker build -t llm-agent .

```

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

```

and in another terminal

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Thank you  
Kind regards

Respected sir  
I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

Thanks for relentless efforts [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..

Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of my office environment,



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a user interacting with a web-based lab environment, specifically "Play with Docker" (PWD), which is a common platform used in data science and MLOps courses for hands-on Docker experience.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Lab Environment Details:**
*   **Platform:** The URL `https://labs.play-with-docker.com/` clearly identifies the platform as "Play with Docker". This is a free, interactive playground for learning and experimenting with Docker.
*   **Session Information:**
    *   A unique session ID/instance name is `cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol2o9000cd7icg` (visible in the title bar and URL).
    *   The session has a remaining time of `44:22` minutes/seconds, indicating it's a timed lab session.
    *   Options to `CLOSE SESSION`, `DELETE` the node, or use an `EDITOR` are available, typical for managing virtual lab resources.
*   **Node Details:**
    *   The active node is named `node1` within the terminal prompt.
    *   Its internal IP address is `192.168.0.13`.
    *   The SSH command to connect to this node externally is provided, although partially obscured: `ssh ip172-18-0-93-cvqlfo0l2o9000cd7ic0@direct.labs.play-`. This suggests it's a virtual machine or container acting as a Docker host.
    *   There's an "OPEN PORT" button, which allows users to expose specific ports on the Docker node to the internet, useful for testing web applications running inside containers.
    *   Fields for `Memory` and `CPU` are present but currently show no usage metrics.

**2. User Activity and Command Execution:**
*   **Terminal Access:** The user is currently in a web-based terminal connected to the `node1` instance.
*   **User and Host:** The prompt `root@192.168.0.13` indicates the user is `root` and is operating directly on the node with IP `192.168.0.13`. The `~` signifies the current working directory is the home directory.
*   **Docker Build Command:** The core activity is the execution of a `docker build` command. This is fundamental for creating custom Docker images.
    *   The image is being tagged as `tdsproject1` with the `latest` tag (`-t tdsproject1:latest`). This suggests the user is building a Docker image related to a "TDS Project" (likely "The Data Science Project" or similar).
    *   The `.` indicates that the Dockerfile and the build context are located in the current directory.
    *   The output of the build process is being redirected (`>`) to a log file named `tds-proj1build.log`. This is a good practice for debugging and reviewing build processes.

**3. Context for Data Science:**
*   This screenshot demonstrates a practical application of Docker, which is crucial in modern data science workflows. Data scientists use Docker to:
    *   **Create Reproducible Environments:** Package their code, dependencies (Python libraries, R packages, etc.), and even data into a single, portable image.
    *   **Deploy Models:** Deploy trained machine learning models as services within containers.
    *   **Run Experiments:** Ensure consistent execution environments across different machines or cloud providers.
    *   The `tdsproject1` tag strongly hints at a data science-related project or course module where students learn to containerize their data science applications.

### Post #443 by **Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (Course TA, ds-students)
*April 08, 2025, 21:11 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a Docker build process failing within a Linux terminal environment, likely as part of a data science course project. The user is attempting to build a Docker image for "TDS-Project1", but an installed utility `uv` is not found immediately after its installation.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. User and Environment Context:**
*   **User:** `root`
*   **Host:** `tds-course-temp-bq` (suggests a temporary virtual machine or environment for "The Data Science Course").
*   **Current Directory:** The user has navigated deep into a directory structure related to a GitHub repository:
    `/mnt/sdb/github_approach/github_repos/22f3002723/TDS-Project1-Jan25-622ed8adf432b6c539321e6519d62da09248a542/`
    *   `22f3002723` appears to be a short commit hash or project identifier.
    *   `TDS-Project1-Jan25-622ed8adf432b6c539321e6519d62da09248a542` is a specific project directory, likely cloned from a repository, possibly corresponding to a specific commit or branch from January 25th.

**2. Docker Build Command:**
*   **Command Executed:** `docker build -t 22f3002723:latest .`
    *   This command initiates a Docker image build.
    *   `-t 22f3002723:latest`: Tags the resulting image with the name `22f3002723` and the tag `latest`.
    *   `.`: Indicates that the `Dockerfile` is located in the current directory.

**3. Docker Build Process (Successful Steps):**
*   The build process starts, taking 8.7 seconds so far, completing 8 out of 10 steps.
*   **Base Image:** `docker.io/library/python:latest` is used as the base image (step 1/7).
*   **System Updates & Dependencies:**
    *   Step 2/7 successfully updates `apt` package lists and installs `curl` and `ca-certificates`. This is a common prerequisite for downloading other tools.
    *   `apt-get clean` and `rm -rf` are used to clean up apt caches, reducing image size.
*   **`uv` Installation Attempt:**
    *   Step 3/7 attempts to install `uv` (a fast Python package installer/resolver from Astral) using a `curl` script: `curl -sSFL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. This step completes successfully in 0.7 seconds, indicating the script *ran*.

**4. Docker Build Process (Failed Steps & Error):**
*   **Failure Point:** The build fails at step 4/7.
*   **Error Command:** `RUN uv --version`
*   **Specific Error Message:**
    *   `0.240 /bin/sh: 1: uv: not found`
        *   This is the core problem: the `uv` command, which was supposedly installed in the previous step, cannot be found by the shell (`/bin/sh`) when `uv --version` is executed.
*   **Dockerfile Context:** The error points to `Dockerfile:25`.
    *   Lines 23-27 of the Dockerfile are shown:
        ```dockerfile
        23 |
        24 | # Verify uv installation
        25 | >>> RUN uv --version
        26 |
        27 | # Set working directory inside the container
        ```
    *   This confirms that line 25, `RUN uv --version`, is directly responsible for the failure.
*   **Final Docker Error:**
    *   `ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c uv --version" did not complete successfully: exit code 127`
        *   `exit code 127` specifically indicates "command not found" in Unix-like systems, confirming the `/bin/sh: uv: not found` message.

**5. Root Cause Analysis (Implied):**
The most common reason for "command not found" after an installation script in a Dockerfile is that the installer places the executable (`uv` in this case) into a directory that is not part of the container's default `PATH` environment variable. When `RUN uv --version` is executed as a *separate* `RUN` instruction, it starts a new shell session that doesn't inherit any `PATH` modifications made by the `uv` installer in the *previous* `RUN` instruction (step 3/7), unless those modifications were persistent (e.g., added to a global profile or explicitly set in the Dockerfile).

A common solution is to combine the installation and verification into a single `RUN` instruction, or to explicitly add the installation directory of `uv` to the `PATH` environment variable *before* attempting to run `uv`.

Thanks [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http\_proxy and https\_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

[Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.
> # /// script
> # dependencies = [
> # "requests",
> # ]
> # ///
> import requests
> import datetime as dt
> import zoneinfo
> import argparse
> import os
> import zipfile
> parser = argparse.…

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards

Hi [@22f3003083](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3003083)

Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a file viewer interface, likely a web-based platform such as GitHub or a similar repository browser, showing a tabular data file. The context suggests it's a submission tracking sheet for a data science course project.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Interface Elements:**
    *   **Tabs:** "Preview" (currently active), "Code", "Blame" - standard options for viewing files in a code repository.
    *   **File Details:** The file contains "1069 lines (1069 loc)" and is "127 KB" in size.
    *   **Actions:** Icons for "Raw" view, "Copy content", "Download file", and "Edit file" are visible on the top right.
    *   **Search/Filter Bar:** A search or filter is active, displaying the query "22f3003083/v1".

2.  **Table Structure (Project Submission Tracking):**
    The main content is a table, likely representing submissions for a course project. The column headers indicate the type of information being tracked:
    *   "Timestamp"
    *   "Email Address"
    *   "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?"
    *   "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?"

3.  **Specific Submission Entry (Row 932):**
    The table shows at least 932 entries, with one specific entry visible (row 932) which perfectly matches the search query.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (Data Entries):**

*   **Search Query:** `22f3003083/v1`
*   **Row Number:** `932`
*   **Timestamp:** `2/16/2025 23:20:17`
*   **Email Address:** `22f3003083@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **GitHub Repository Link:** `https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS_Project_1`
*   **DockerHub Image Name:** `22f3003083/v1`

**Interpretation:**

This screenshot likely shows a record of a student's submission for "Project 1" in a data science course. The student, identified by the email `22f3003083@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (suggesting IIT Madras - ds.study.iitm.ac.in), submitted their project on February 16, 2025, at 23:20:17. Their project code is hosted on GitHub at `https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS_Project_1`, and they have published a Docker image named `22f3003083/v1` to DockerHub. The active search bar indicates someone was specifically looking up this student's DockerHub image name.*

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

Kind regards

These are your project 1 responses,  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a submission or tracking interface, likely from a data science course, showing entries related to student projects.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Search Query:** The interface is currently filtered or searching for the identifier `23f1001236`.
2.  **Table Headers:** The table columns are:
    *   `Timestamp`: When the entry was recorded.
    *   `Email Address`: The student's email.
    *   `What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?`: A question asking for the GitHub repository URL for "Project 1" code.
    *   `What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?`: A question asking for the name of the DockerHub image.
3.  **Student Identity:** All entries belong to the same student, identified by the email `23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email format suggests an academic institution, possibly IIT Madras (iitm.ac.in), and the 'ds.study' subdomain implies a Data Science program.
4.  **Submission Dates:** The submissions were made on February 15th and 16th, 2025.
5.  **Project Submissions:** There are three entries for this student, indicating multiple submissions or updates:
    *   **First Entry (2/15/2025 20:29:39):**
        *   GitHub Repository: `https://github.com/MaheshSingh01/tds_proj.git`
        *   DockerHub Image: `maheshsingh01/tds-proj`
    *   **Second Entry (2/16/2025 21:28:12):**

We are considering latest submission which have docker repo `maheshsingh01/tdsrepos`   
which is not accessible publically.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform:** The user is attempting to access a resource on **Docker Hub** (`hub.docker.com`), which is a cloud-based registry service for Docker images and repositories.
2.  **Intended Resource:** The URL indicates the user was trying to access the `tags` section of a Docker repository named `tdsrepos` belonging to the user or organization `maheshsingh01`.
3.  **Current State:** The page displays a **"404 Not Found" error**. This means the specific resource (the `tdsrepos` repository or its `tags` section under `maheshsingh01`) could not be found at the requested URL.
4.  **Context:** Given this is from a data science course forum, it's highly probable that a student or user is trying to pull or access a Docker image/repository relevant to their data science coursework, and they have encountered an issue finding the specified resource on Docker Hub. This could be due to a typo in the URL, the repository being private, moved, deleted, or never having existed in the first place under that specific user/organization.

**Transcriptions:**

*   **URL:** `https://hub.docker.com/r/maheshsingh01/tdsrepos/tags`
*   **Breadcrumbs:** `Explore / maheshsingh01 / tdsrepos`
*   **Error Number:** `404`
*   **Error Message 1:** `Oops!`
*   **Error Message 2:** `The page you have requested was not found`*

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Requested sir  
This is to request that in my evaluation a got 0 cause of the use of lowercase d instead of uppercase D but I have already submitted the docker file in my git hub repo also.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a directory listing and commit history from a version control system, very similar to GitHub or GitLab, likely showing the initial state of a project repository.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Project State:** This view shows the files included in an **"Initial commit"** for a project. This means all the listed files were added to the repository at its very beginning.
2.  **Author and Commit ID:** The commit was made by user **`wag28`** with the commit ID **`eff178a`**.
3.  **Commit Timestamp:** This initial commit occurred approximately **"2 months ago"** from the time the screenshot was taken.
4.  **Project Type (Inferred from files):**
    *   **Python-based:** The presence of multiple `.py` files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`) and a `requirements.txt` file strongly indicates a Python project.
    *   **Data Science / Machine Learning Focus:**
        *   `datagen.py` suggests a script for generating or processing data.
        *   `evaluate.py` points to a script for evaluating model performance or project outcomes.
        *   `app.py` could be a web application (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit) that serves a data science model or provides an interface.
        *   `tasksA.py` and `tasksB.py` suggest modularized code for different parts or stages of a data science pipeline or assignment.
    *   **Containerized/Deployable:** The inclusion of `dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` indicates that the project is designed to be run within a Docker container, promoting reproducibility and ease of deployment.
    *   **Version Controlled:** Files like `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` confirm that the project is managed with Git.
    *   **Standard Documentation:** `README.md` (for project description) and `LICENSE` (for licensing information) are present, indicating good project hygiene.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no explicit "code," "commands," or "error messages" in the traditional sense (like a terminal output). Instead, the screenshot shows file names and commit messages/actions.

**Transcribed Content:**

*   **User/Commit ID:**
    *   `wag28`
    *   `eff178a`
*   **File Names:**
    *   `.dockerignore`
    *   `.gitattributes`
    *   `.gitignore`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `README.md`
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`
*   **Commit Messages/Actions:**
    *   `added` (appears for most files)
    *   `Initial commit` (specifically for `.gitattributes`, implying it applies to the whole commit)
*   **Timestamp:**
    *   `2 months ago` (appears for all files)*

Thank you i found my mistake in my docker file i wrote this CMD [“uv”, “run”, “app.py”] instead of  
CMD [“uvicorn”, “main:app”, “–host”, “0.0.0.0”, “–port”, “8000”].Now i think everything works fine

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir, my project 1 marks have still not increased even though while during evaluation it shows 4/10 for the task 1. It was said that the docker image prerequisite will be removed and without that the evaluation would be done, but there is still no change in my marks. please look into it once, as my dashboard currently reflects 0 for project 1.

Good evening!  
[1000092114|690x198](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/uploads/short-url/30ijyIo5UiUUEVvnPZklfYVY2mI.jpeg)

I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.

The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.

I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.

Thanks,  
Garima

Sir,  
I am Saksham Umate and my project 1 was to be re-evaluation because of docker file not found in root ,but it was their so you had given me confirmation that it will re-evaluate after end term. I had already shared my docker file systems configuration at docker hub

So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it

Tell me if any information is needed about project from my side  
Thank you!

Best regards,  
Saksham

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an email from "Carlton D'Silva" dated "9 Apr" to a "Learner," providing important updates and clarifications regarding Project 1 (P1) submissions in a data science course, particularly concerning Docker and Git requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Sender and Date:**
*   **From:** Carlton D'Silva
*   **Date:** 9 Apr

**Email Purpose:**
*   To inform learners about changes to the submission requirements and evaluation process for Project 1 (P1), specifically addressing issues related to locating the Dockerfile and subsequent evaluation.

**Key Information and Relaxed Requirements:**

1.  **Initial P1 Failure Reason:** P1 submissions previously failed a pre-requisite if the `Dockerfile` was not located in the **base of the root directory** of the GitHub repository.
2.  **Relaxed Dockerfile Location:** This strict requirement for the `Dockerfile` to be in the root directory is now relaxed.
3.  **P1 Submission Evaluation Timeline:** P1 submissions will now be looked at separately **after the end term only.**
4.  **New Dockerfile Search Method:** A script will be run to perform a **directory tree search** for the `Dockerfile` within the GitHub repository.
5.  **GitHub Repo Change Deadline:** **No changes to the github repo after Feb 18th will be considered.** (This is a crucial hard deadline for repo content.)
6.  **File Naming Strictness:** **No spelling deviations will be accepted for the required files.** (This implies that file names like `Dockerfile` must be exact, including capitalization.)
7.  **Other Prerequisites Remain:** All other prerequisites for P1 still apply and must be met.

**Technical Requirements for Docker:**

1.  **Dockerfile Build Success:** The Docker image must build successfully **without errors from the Dockerfile**.
2.  **Container Operational Time:** After building, the Docker container must become **operational within 5 minutes of starting**.
3.  **Evaluation Environment:** Evaluations will be carried out exactly according to the **test environment that was specified**.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   `Dockerfile` (This filename appears multiple times and is critical for the project.)*

Evaluations are done for such cases where Dockerfile(with name of Dockerfile as `Dockerfile`) was present inside other folders than root folder of your github repo.

Hi [@22f3000819](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/22f3000819)

We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
S. Sharmile

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.

Thanks & Kind regards

Hi Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing **Project1**, but I accidentally named the **Dockerfile** as `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’).  
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it.  
Thank you!
