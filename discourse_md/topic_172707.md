# Topic: Queries regarding End Term exam solutions

### Post #1 by **Shambhavi ** (ds-students)

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir,

I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.

I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a multiple-choice question (MCQ) from a data science course, focusing on the identification of valid web server log entries.

### Key Information:

1.  **Question Context:**
    *   **Question Number:** 300
    *   **Question ID:** 6406531231221
    *   **Question Type:** MCQ (Multiple Choice Question)
    *   **Correct Marks:** 2
    *   **Objective:** Identify which of the provided options represents a "valid log entry based on the provided format." The "provided format" is implicitly defined by the structure of the options, which closely resembles an Extended Common Log Format (ECLF) or a similar Apache/Nginx access log format.

2.  **Log Entry Structure (Inferred from Correct Option):**
    A valid log entry appears to follow this general pattern:
    `remote_host rfc931 authuser [date_time_zone] "request_method request_path request_protocol" status_code bytes_transferred "referer" "user_agent" additional_domain additional_ip`

    *   `remote_host`: IP address of the client making the request (e.g., `203.0.113.7`).
    *   `rfc931` and `authuser`: Typically represented by ` -- ` (hyphens) when not available.
    *   `[date_time_zone]`: Timestamp in the format `[DD/Mon/YYYY:HH:MM:SS Zone]` (e.g., `[14/Dec/2024:16:45:11 -0500]`).
    *   `"request_method request_path request_protocol"`: The HTTP request line enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"`).
    *   `status_code`: Numeric HTTP status code (e.g., `200`).
    *   `bytes_transferred`: Size of the object returned to the client in bytes (e.g., `3500`).
    *   `"referer"`: The referring URL, or `"-"` if none.
    *   `"user_agent"`: The client's user agent string.
    *   `additional_domain`: A domain name (e.g., `www.s-anand.net`).
    *   `additional_ip`: Another IP address, possibly for a proxy or CDN (e.g., `192.254.190.219`).

3.  **Analysis of Options:**
    *   **Incorrect Options (Marked with ✖):**
        *   **Option 1 (6406534159824):** Appears syntactically similar to the correct one but is marked incorrect. Without explicit format rules, the specific error isn't immediately obvious but might relate to the version of Chrome/Safari or the final IP address compared to the correct one.
        *   **Option 2 (6406534159825):** Invalidates the request line by including "INVALID" within the path/protocol section: `"POST /image.jpg INVALID"`. Standard HTTP requests do not contain such a string in this position.
        *   **Option 3 (6406534159826):** Invalidates the log entry by using the text "OK" instead of a numeric HTTP status code (like `200`) after the request line: `"PUT /image.jpg HTTP/1.1" OK 1234`.

    *   **Correct Option (Marked with ✔):**
        *   **Option 4 (6406534159827):** This log entry correctly adheres to the established format, featuring a numeric status code (`200`), a standard request line (`"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"`), a valid timestamp, and plausible values for other fields.

**Question and Options:**

Question Number : 300 Question Id : 6406531231221 Question Type : MCQ
Correct Marks : 2
Question Label : Multiple Choice Question
Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?
Options :
6406534159824. ✖ 192.168.1.1 -- [12/Dec/2024:14:05:59 -0500] "GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36" www.s-anand.net 192.254.190.217

Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”

To filter such logs, we need:

Time → for the hour and the day (Monday)  
Method → to filter POST  
URL → to filter /images/

So, the correct minimal set is:

> Time, Method, URL

Time → needed   
Method → needed   
URL → needed   
Referer → not needed, but not harmful

So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.



> **Image Content:** *Here's the analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a multiple-choice question from a data science course forum, likely related to web log analysis or data filtering.

The question asks users to identify which fields are necessary to filter web server logs or similar data based on specific criteria:
1.  **HTTP Method:** "POST requests"
2.  **URL Path:** "pages under /images/"
3.  **Time of Day:** "from 15:00 to 18:00"
4.  **Day of the Week:** "on Mondays"

There are four provided options, each listing a set of fields. The first option is marked with a green checkmark, indicating it is the correct answer, while the other three are marked with red cross marks, indicating they are incorrect. Each option is prefixed with a numerical identifier (e.g., "6406534159828.").

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
Question Label : Multiple Choice Question

Which of the following fields are necessary to filter "POST requests made for pages under
/images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays"?

Options :
6406534159828. ✅ Time, Request, Method, URL
6406534159829. ❌ Time, Method, Status, Size
6406534159830. ❌ Time, Method, URL, Referer
6406534159831. ❌ Time, Status, URL, Server
```*



Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:

Status is numeric (200)  
Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct

All required fields are present and properly formatted

The other options were as follows:

9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)

9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)

9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a multiple-choice question from what appears to be an online quiz or assessment platform, likely part of a data science course, focusing on web technologies and HTTP methods.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

*   **Question Type:** Multiple Choice Question.
*   **Marks Allotted:** 2 marks for a correct answer.
*   **Question Content:** The question asks to identify an HTTP method that is "idempotent," clearly defining idempotency as "meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request."
*   **Provided Options:**
    *   POST
    *   PUT
    *   GET
    *   DELETE
*   **Correct Answer Indication:** The option `PUT` is marked with a green checkmark (`✓`), indicating it is the correct answer according to the system. The other options (POST, GET, DELETE) are marked with an asterisk (`*`), suggesting they are incorrect answers in the context of this question.
    *   *Note on Idempotency:* In standard HTTP definitions, GET, PUT, and DELETE are all considered idempotent. POST is not. The system has specifically marked PUT as the correct answer.
*   **Question Metadata:**
    *   **Sub-Section Number:** 4
    *   **Sub-Section ID:** 640653189815
    *   **Question Shuffling Allowed:** Yes

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code snippets, commands, or explicit error messages in this screenshot. The content is formatted as a question and its options.

**Exact Transcription of Text:**

Correct Marks : 2
Question Label : Multiple Choice Question
Which HTTP method is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request?
Options :
6406534159747. * POST
6406534159748. ✓ PUT
6406534159749. * GET
6406534159750. * DELETE
Sub-Section Number : 4
Sub-Section Id : 640653189815
Question Shuffling Allowed : Yes*



  
Correct Answer(s):

PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.

GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.

DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).

---

Incorrect Answer:

POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.

(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)

Thank you

### Post #2 by **Koustubh Ramakrishnan** (ds-students)
*April 15, 2025, 17:19 UTC*
Agree & second all thoughts shared by [@24f2003130](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/24f2003130) above.

* I also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered\_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case `len(filtered entries)` seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .  

  

> **Image Content:** *Here's a detailed analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The screenshot displays a multiple-choice question (MCQ) from what appears to be an online quiz or assignment related to data processing, specifically log analysis.
*   **Question Details:**
    *   **Question Number:** 309
    *   **Question ID:** 6406531231230
    *   **Question Type:** MCQ
    *   **Correct Marks:** 1
    *   **Question Label:** Multiple Choice Question
*   **Problem Statement:** The user is asked to identify the best way to count a specific subset of log entries. The log entries have already undergone an initial filtering step, resulting in a list named `filtered_entries`. The goal is to count requests within `filtered_entries` that meet two specific criteria:
    1.  They have a **404 status code**.
    2.  They are for **pages under `/error/`**.
*   **Options Provided:** Four options are given, each with a unique ID. The first three options propose Python code snippets, while the fourth is a general "None of these" option. Each option is marked with either a red 'X' (incorrect) or a green checkmark (correct).

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

**Question Text:**
After filtering the log entries (in a list filtered_entries), which of the following is the best way to count the number of requests with a 404 status code for pages under /error/?

**Options:**

1.  **6406534159860.** ❌ Use `len(filtered_entries)`
2.  **6406534159861.** ❌ Use `len(entries)`
3.  **6406534159862.** ❌ Use `sum(1 for entry in entries)`
4.  **6406534159863.** ✅ `None of these`

**Analysis of Correctness (Implied by Marks):**

The problem requires counting entries that satisfy *two specific conditions* (404 status code AND page under `/error/`) from the `filtered_entries` list.

*   Option 1 (`len(filtered_entries)`) would count *all* entries in `filtered_entries`. This is incorrect because `filtered_entries` itself is implied to be just a generally "filtered" list, not necessarily filtered specifically for the 404 status and `/error/` path as required by the question. If `filtered_entries` *already contained only* the entries matching the criteria, this would be correct. However, given it's marked incorrect, it implies `filtered_entries` still needs further conditional filtering.
*   Option 2 (`len(entries)`) and Option 3 (`sum(1 for entry in entries)`) both refer to a list named `entries` (presumably the original, unfiltered list or a different one) and would count all elements in it, which is not what the question asks for (it specifies `filtered_entries` and specific conditions).
*   Option 4 (`None of these`) is marked as the correct answer. This confirms that a more sophisticated counting method would be required, such as a list comprehension or generator expression with conditional logic (e.g., `sum(1 for entry in filtered_entries if entry.status_code == 404 and "/error/" in entry.path)`) rather than a simple length calculation of a pre-existing list or an unrelated list.*


* The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.
* Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.

Request you to please clarify and consider these points.

Yes [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) the wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list `filtered_entries`.

# Clarifications on Queries

1. **Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?**  
   Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response.
2. **HTTP method is idempotent**  
   This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.
3. **Entries with 404 status code**  
   Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
4. **Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”?**  
   Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because:

* Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL
* Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page
* Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement

### Post #5 by **Shambhavi ** (ds-students)
*April 16, 2025, 10:15 UTC*
Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:

1. Redundancy in Option A:  
   The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.
2. Simplicity in Filtering:  
   Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:

Time → for checking the hour and weekday.

Method → to filter only POST.

URL → to ensure the request is under /images/.

Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.

3. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices:  
   In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.

Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a single row of data, likely from a table or log within a data science course management system or a forum's backend. It appears to be tracking the status or properties of a specific question or assessment item.

**Key Information:**

*   **Row/Item Number:** `31`
*   **Primary Identifier:** `6406531231230` (Likely a unique ID for a question or assessment item).
*   **Question Type:** `MCQ` (Most probably stands for Multiple Choice Question).
*   **Status/Category Indicator:** `W` (The exact meaning is unclear without further context, but it could denote a state like "Weighted," "Written," or a specific question category).
*   **Numerical Value:** `0` (This could represent a count, an initial score, or a specific status code).
*   **Related Identifier 1:** `6406534159860` (Another unique ID, possibly for a version of the question, an answer set, or an associated asset).
*   **Related Identifier 2:** `6406534159863` (Another unique ID, very similar to the previous one, possibly indicating a current version or a linked component).
*   **Value/Score:** `1.00` (Likely indicates the maximum score for the item, its weight, or a full credit status).
*   **Modification Status:** `Not Modified` (Indicates that this particular item has not undergone any changes).
*   **Description/Reason:** `The question and answer remain the same. No changes required` (This text provides the specific reason for the "Not Modified" status, confirming that the content and its associated answer are unchanged and require no further action).

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are no traditional code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The transcribed elements are data points and descriptive text indicating the status of a question or an answer. The text appearing exactly as it does is:

*   `31`
*   `6406531231230`
*   `MCQ`
*   `W`
*   `0`
*   `6406534159860`
*   `6406534159863`
*   `1.00`
*   `Not Modified`
*   `The question and answer remain the same. No changes required`*

  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

*   **Content Type:** This is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) from a data science or programming course, likely a quiz or assignment.
*   **Question ID & Number:** The question is identified as "Question Number : 309" and "Question Id : 6406531231230".
*   **Marks:** It is worth "1" correct mark.
*   **Topic:** The question pertains to log analysis and data manipulation in Python, specifically counting specific entries in a list of log entries.
*   **Problem Statement:** The user is asked to find the "best way to count the number of requests with a 404 status code for pages under /error/" after some initial filtering has already occurred, resulting in a list named `filtered_entries`.
*   **Options Provided:** Four options are given, three of which propose Python code snippets, and one is "None of these".
*   **Correct Answer Indication:**
    *   Options 1, 2, and 3 are marked with a red 'X', indicating they are incorrect.
    *   Option 4 ("None of these") is marked with a green checkmark, indicating it is the correct answer.
*   **Implied Discrepancy:** The problem states "After filtering the log entries (in a list `filtered_entries`)". If `filtered_entries` truly contains *only* the specific log entries (404 status and /error/ pages), then `len(filtered_entries)` (Option 1) would be the most direct and best way to count them. However, since Option 1 is marked incorrect and "None of these" is correct, it implies that:
    *   Either `filtered_entries` is not the *final* pre-filtered list as precisely described in the problem (e.g., it's a list that needs *further* filtering for 404 and /error/), or
    *   The question expects a more complex single-line solution (e.g., using a list comprehension with conditional logic and `sum()`) that isn't explicitly provided as an option, suggesting none of the presented solutions are sufficiently "best" or complete for the actual underlying task, or
    *   The question itself, or its options, might be slightly ambiguous or designed to make the user think beyond simple `len()` calls on pre-defined lists.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

**Question Prompt:**
After filtering the log entries (in a list filtered_entries), which of the following is the best way to count the number of requests with a 404 status code for pages under /error/?

**Options:**
*   `Use len(filtered_entries)`
*   `Use len(entries)`
*   `Use sum(1 for entry in entries)`
*   `None of these`*



Can you please look into it?

[@iamprasna](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/iamprasna) sir , the scores have been updated on the dashboard as well and the answer for the question in point 3 is still the same

Additionally , sir I have attached the snapshot of a dec’24 TDS PYQ which is a replica of this question and the answer for the same is mention the first option.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) from a data science course or quiz, focusing on Python list manipulation for log analysis.

### Key Information:

*   **Question Context:** It's Question Number 351, with an ID of 6406531040283, and carries 1 mark.
*   **Problem Statement:** The user is asked to identify the best way to count the number of "successful GET requests for pages under `/telugump3/`" *after* these specific log entries have already been filtered and stored in a Python list named `filtered_entries`.
*   **Core Skill Tested:** Knowledge of Python's built-in functions for determining the length or number of elements in a list.
*   **Correct Answer:** The first option, `Use len(filtered_entries)`, is marked as correct. This is the standard and most efficient way to get the number of items in a Python list.
*   **Incorrect Options Analysis:**
    *   `Use len(entries)`: Incorrect because `entries` likely refers to the original, unfiltered list, not the already filtered subset.
    *   `Use sum(1 for entry in entries)`: While this is a valid way to count elements (using a generator expression and `sum()`), it's applied to the `entries` (unfiltered) list, making it incorrect for the problem statement. Also, `len()` is generally more idiomatic and often more performant for simply getting the length of a list.
    *   `Use count(filtered_entries)`: Incorrect syntax/usage. The `count()` method is typically called on a list to count occurrences of a *specific item* within that list (e.g., `my_list.count(item)`), not to return the total number of elements in the list itself when passed the list as an argument.

### Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

**Question Text:**

```
After filtering the log entries (in a list
filtered_entries), which of the following
is the best way to count the number of successful
GET requests for pages under /telugump3/?
```

**Options:**

*   `6406533514340. ✔ Use len(filtered_entries)`
*   `6406533514341. ✖ Use len(entries)`
*   `6406533514342. ✖ Use sum(1 for entry in entries)`

Hi,  
From where are you checking the transcripts? I’m not able to see the answer transcripts in the score checker app.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum's "SCORE CHECKER" application:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a web page titled "SCORE CHECKER," which appears to be a portal for students to view their scores.

Thanks for the reply, but I only see the question id’s and answer id’s, not able to find the transcripts.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "Score Checker" interface, likely from an online examination or quiz platform used in a data science course (given the context of the prompt). It provides a detailed breakdown of a student's performance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), including initial scores, correct answers, and any post-evaluation modifications.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### **Overall Interface Elements:**

*   **Header:** "SCORE CHECKER" is prominently displayed, along with a university or institution logo (partially visible, appears to be "INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY").
*   **Navigation:** Links for "Transcript", "Home", and "Logout" are present in the top-right corner, indicating typical user portal functionalities.

### **Tabular Data (Score Details):**

The main content is a table with 11 rows (at least, showing up to S.NO. 11) and 9 columns, providing granular information for each question.

*   **S.NO.:** (Serial Number) A sequential number for each question, from 1 to 11.
*   **Question ID:** A unique numerical identifier for each question (e.g., `6406531252398`, `6406531252403`).
*   **Question Type:** The format of the question. All visible entries are "MCQ" (Multiple Choice Question).
*   **Result:** Indicates the initial outcome of the student's attempt.
    *   "C" for Correct.
    *   "W" for Wrong.
*   **Score:** The initial points awarded for the question before any modifications. It's either `0` or `1.00`. This suggests each correct answer is worth 1 point.
*   **Selected Option:** A numerical ID representing the option chosen by the student for that question (e.g., `6406534219005`, `6406534219025`).
*   **Correct Option:** A numerical ID representing the correct answer option for that question (e.g., `6406534219005`, `6406534219024`).
*   **Mark:** The final score awarded for the question after any post-evaluation adjustments. This can differ from the "Score" column.
*   **Modification of Question:** Indicates if the question content itself underwent modification.
    *   "Not Modified" for most questions.
    *   A Question ID (e.g., `6406531252403`) if the question's content was specifically modified.
*   **Remarks:** Additional notes or reasons for score adjustments or modifications.

### **Key Observations and Insights:**

1.  **Standard Scoring:** For most questions, if `Result` is "C", `Score` is `1.00` and `Mark` is `1.00`. If `Result` is "W", `Score` is `0` and `Mark` is `0`. The `Selected Option` matches `Correct Option` for "C" results and differs for "W" results.

2.  **Post-Evaluation Scoring Adjustments:**
    *   **Rows 9, 10, 11:** These questions initially had a `Result` of "W" and a `Score` of `0`. However, their final `Mark` is `1.00`. This indicates that a post-evaluation review led to these questions being awarded full marks, even though the student's initial answer was technically incorrect or initially marked as such. The "Modification of Question" column for these rows still shows "Not Modified," suggesting the change was in the scoring logic rather than the question's text.
    *   **Row 9 Remark:** For Question ID `6406531252402`, the `Remark` states: `Remains the same`. This is slightly ambiguous given the `Mark` changed from `0` to `1.00`. It might imply that the *reason* for the question being initially wrong "remains the same," but the decision was to award marks regardless, or it might refer to the question's content remaining unchanged.

3.  **Highlighted Row (Row 4):** This row is highlighted in yellow, drawing attention to a specific modification.
    *   **Question ID:** `6406531252403`
    *   **Initial Status:** `Result` "C", `Score` `1.00`, `Selected Option` `6406534219025`, `Correct Option` `6406534219024`.
    *   **Modification:** The `Modification of Question` column explicitly shows the `Question ID` `6406531252403`, indicating this question was modified. The `Mark` remains `1.00`.
    *   **Critical Remark:** The `Remarks` column states: `Option 3 and option 2 must be awarded with marks`. This is a crucial piece of information. It means that during the post-evaluation review, it was determined that multiple options (Option 2 and Option 3, in addition to the original correct option) are now considered correct for this question. Although the student already selected an option that resulted in a correct answer, this modification ensures that other students who might have chosen Options 2 or 3 would also receive full marks.

### **Transcribed Information (Code/Commands/Error Messages):**

There are no explicit code, commands, or error messages in the traditional programming sense. The numerical IDs are data identifiers. The only natural language text in these categories appears in the "Remarks" column:

*   **Row 4 Remarks:** `Option 3 and option 2 must be awarded with marks`
*   **Row 9 Remarks:** `Remains the same`*

It seems that the option to download the answer key has been removed. However, you could consider reaching out to someone in the group or checking the dashboard for solution pdf of question paper. You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly.

[@iamprasna](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/iamprasna) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Please look into it once. According to point 3 of [@iamprasna](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/iamprasna)’s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97. I brought this into attention before the scores were pushed to the dashboard.

Regards,  
Shivaditya

The correction has been done to the following question for both the FN and AN sessions. You must be able to see the change in scores shortly

1. **Entries with 404 status code**  
   Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
