Hi Sahil,

Please find it at the following location.



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a data science course forum or website navigation. The left sidebar lists course topics like "Tools in Data Science", "Data Sourcing", "Data Analysis", etc., suggesting a structured course. The main content area includes "Course Links" with links such as "TDS Discourse" and "Tools in Data Science Public course home page." A section titled "Jan 2025 Links" lists links like "TDS: Course calendar - Jan 2025" and "TDS: Course material – Jupyter notebooks, datasets, etc.".



Kind regards
