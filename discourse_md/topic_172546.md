**Role:**  ds-students



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science course forum discussing the Haversine formula. A student asks for help in calculating the distance between two locations (Location A: Latitude = 40.748817, Longitude = -73.985428, Location B: Latitude = 40.761293, Longitude = -73.982294). The problem is presented within an online quiz environment, indicated by "End Term Quiz", "TDS" as the subject, and a question menu with numbered buttons. The quiz is accessible in "Exam Mode" or "Learning Mode". The student is interacting with the material in question 1.



  



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot shows a data science quiz platform, specifically a question on "TDS". A ChatGPT response is visible, explaining the Haversine formula to calculate distances between two points given their latitudes and longitudes. The steps detailed are: converting degrees to radians using "radians = (Ï€/180) * degrees", calculating differences in latitude and longitude, and applying the Haversine formula itself.  A student then provides radian values for latitudes and longitudes of two locations and asks "Does this look correct?". The UI includes question navigation buttons (1-40) and indicates an "End Term Quiz" with a total of 40 marks.

The user is currently on question 19, with the page URL `https://quizpractice.space/question-paper/practise/53/3a44150b-f92#question24`. The question involves calculating the distance between two locations using the Haversine formula and selecting the correct distance (in meters) from provided options. The locations are the "Emergency Supply Center" (latitude: 40.7222, longitude: -74.0134) and "Eastview Medical Center" (latitude: 40.7306, longitude: -73.9866). The multiple-choice options displayed are distances in meters: "1,975 meters", "2,346 meters", "2,925 meters", and "3,254 meters".
