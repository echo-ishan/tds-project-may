same problem with me  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a student's grades for the "Tools in Data Science" course.  It displays assignment scores for weeks 1 through 5, ranging from 20.00 to 90.00.  Specifically, "Week 3 Assignment - 21.10" and "Week 4 Assignment - 20.00" indicate potentially low scores that might need attention.  The text "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent" suggests the student missed the first programming quiz.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

The UI displays a table with three saved attempts, indicated by "Reload" buttons and their corresponding date/time (e.g., "from 3/2/2025, 1:44:11 PM"). Each save also shows a "Score", with values ranging from 4 to 6. The text "(most recent is your official score)" indicates that the most recent save determines the final grade. The user is logged in as "23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and can "Logout".

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

Thank you  



> **Image:** This screenshot shows a student's progress in a "Tools in Data Science" course. The UI displays the grades for weekly assignments (Week 1-5) with scores of 100.00, 90.00, 100.00, 110.00, and 100.00 respectively. The "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is marked as "Absent," indicating the student did not complete or attend the quiz. A "Go to Course page >" link suggests navigation to further course content or details.

No code snippets, data visualizations, or specific UI elements related to the problem are present, only the status "Absent". The student needs to address why they were absent from the quiz.

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.  
If not let us know

Kind regards.

Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my score is shown as zero in the dashboard.

Please clarify.
