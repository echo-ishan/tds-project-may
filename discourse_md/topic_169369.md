*   `Week 1 Assignment - 80.00`
*   `Week 2 Assignment - 65.00`
*   `Week 3 Assignment - 21.10`
*   `Week 4 Assignment - 20.00`
*   `Week 5 Assignment - 90.00`
    *   *Analysis:* There's a notable dip in performance in Week 3 and Week 4 assignments, followed by a strong recovery in Week 5. This pattern could be a point of discussion or concern if posted on a forum.

**3. Quiz Status:**
*   `PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent`
    *   *Analysis:* The student did not complete or missed the first programming quiz. This is a critical piece of information for their overall course progress.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a portion of a web interface, likely an assessment or assignment submission portal within an online data science course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **User Authentication and Identity:**
    *   The top section clearly indicates the user's logged-in status.
    *   **User ID:** The user is logged in as `23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email address suggests an institutional affiliation with IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) and specifically within a "ds.study" (data science study) domain. This strongly implies the user is a student or participant in an IITM data science program.
    *   **Logout Option:** A "Logout" button is present, providing standard session management functionality.

2.  **Recent Saves/Submissions and Scoring:**
    *   **Purpose:** The prominent green box titled "Recent saves" tracks the user's progress or attempts on a task. The crucial clarification "(most recent is your official score)" indicates that the latest submission or save is considered the final score for grading purposes.
    *   **Attempt Tracking:** The system records multiple saves, each with a timestamp and an associated score. This suggests an environment where students can submit or save their work iteratively, potentially improving their score with each attempt.
    *   **Iterative Progress:** The three listed saves show an improvement in score over time:
        *   Score: 4 (at 1:38:33 PM)
        *   Score: 5 (at 1:41:44 PM)
        *   Score: 6 (at 1:44:11 PM)
        This demonstrates the student's progress or continued effort on the task, successfully increasing their performance with subsequent attempts.
    *   **Official Score:** As per the system's rule, the user's current official score is **6**.
    *   **Timestamp:** All activities are dated `3/2/2025`. This date being in the future suggests this might be a demo environment, a pre-configured setup for an upcoming course, or a course with a long future duration.
    *   **Reload Functionality:** Each save has a "Reload" button. This feature is very useful in a learning context, allowing the user to revisit a previous state of their work, review their solution at that point, or potentially revert to it if a later attempt goes awry. This is particularly valuable for coding assignments or complex problem-solving tasks.

**In summary,** this screenshot shows a student's performance tracking interface for a data science assignment or assessment within an IITM online course. It highlights iterative progress, clear scoring, and the ability to review past attempts.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

Thank you

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a student's grade summary page for an online data science course.

### Key Information:

1.  **Course Title:** The course is titled "Tools in Data Science".
2.  **Course Status:** It is labeled as a "NEW COURSE", possibly indicating a recent enrollment or a newly launched course offering.
3.  **Assignment Grades:** The student's scores for five weekly assignments are listed:
    *   Week 1 Assignment: 87.50
    *   Week 2 Assignment: 80.00
    *   Week 3 Assignment: 55.30
    *   Week 4 Assignment: 50.00
    *   Week 5 Assignment: 40.00
4.  **Quiz Status:** The student's status for "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is listed as "Absent".
5.  **Navigation:** There is a link at the bottom, "Go to Course page >", which presumably directs the user to the main course content or overview.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. All text displayed is descriptive of the course content and grades.

### Expert Analysis:

As an expert analyzing this from a data science course forum perspective, several critical observations can be made:

1.  **Declining Performance Trend:** The most striking feature is the consistent and significant decline in assignment scores, dropping from a strong 87.50 in Week 1 to a failing 40.00 by Week 5. This indicates a severe struggle as the course progresses.
    *   **Possible Reasons:** This downward trend could be due to increasing difficulty of course material, a lack of foundational understanding, time management issues, disengagement, or external factors impacting the student's ability to perform.
2.  **Missed Programming Quiz:** The "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent" status is a major red flag. In a "Tools in Data Science" course, programming is a core component. Missing a quiz, especially a programming one, suggests a significant gap in participation, understanding, or a serious barrier preventing the student from completing the assessment.
3.  **Combined Concerns:** When combined, the declining assignment grades and the missed programming quiz paint a concerning picture of the student's current standing in the course. The student appears to be falling behind quickly and may be in jeopardy of failing the course if the trend continues.
4.  **Implications for Forum Interaction:**
    *   **Student Perspective:** If this were posted by a student, they would likely be seeking help, advice on how to improve, or expressing frustration/concern about their performance.
    *   **Instructor/TA Perspective:** An instructor or TA viewing this would likely initiate a proactive outreach to the student to understand the challenges they are facing and offer support (e.g., tutoring, office hours, resources).
    *   **Peer Perspective:** Other students might offer solidarity, share tips, or suggest study strategies if this was shared in a public forum.
5.  **Course Structure Implication:** The weekly assignments suggest a fast-paced or regularly assessed course structure, which can exacerbate issues if a student falls behind early on.

In summary, this screenshot indicates a student who started reasonably well but is now significantly struggling in a "Tools in Data Science" course, evidenced by rapidly declining assignment scores and a missed programming quiz. This situation warrants immediate attention and intervention if the student wishes to succeed.*

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.  
If not let us know

Kind regards.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a "course card" or summary view for a student enrolled in a data science course. It provides key information about the course name, its status, and the student's performance on various assignments and quizzes.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Course Title and Status:**
    *   The course is titled "Tools in Data Science".
    *   It is labeled as a "NEW COURSE", which might indicate a recent enrollment or a course that has just started.

2.  **Assignment Scores:**
    *   The student's scores for weekly assignments are listed:
        *   Week 1 Assignment: 100.00
        *   Week 2 Assignment: 65.00 (This is a lower score compared to others and might be a point of concern or discussion.)
        *   Week 3 Assignment: 100.00
        *   Week 4 Assignment: 110.00 (This score is unusually high, potentially indicating extra credit, a higher maximum possible score, or an error/bonus.)
        *   Week 5 Assignment: 100.00

3.  **Quiz Status:**
    *   "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is marked as "Absent". This is a critical piece of information, indicating the student either missed the quiz, did not submit it, or it has not yet been graded. This would likely be the primary reason for a forum post or student inquiry.

4.  **Navigation/Action:**
    *   A button labeled "Go to Course page >" is present at the bottom, suggesting that clicking it would take the user to the full course page for more details, materials, or interaction.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no direct code snippets, commands, or traditional error messages displayed in this screenshot. However, the "Absent" status for the quiz functions as a critical status message indicating a problem or missing component.

*   **Course Title:** Tools in Data Science
*   **Course Status:** NEW COURSE
*   **Assignment Scores (exact transcription):**
    *   Week 1 Assignment - 100.00
    *   Week 2 Assignment - 65.00
    *   Week 3 Assignment - 100.00
    *   Week 4 Assignment - 110.00
    *   Week 5 Assignment - 100.00
*   **Quiz Status (exact transcription):**
    *   PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent
*   **Navigation Button Text:** Go to Course page >*

Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my score is shown as zero in the dashboard.

Please clarify.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a student's academic dashboard for "My Current Courses" within what appears to be an online data science learning platform or university portal.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Academic Performance:**

*   **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) till this term:** **7.8**
*   **Project Cumulative Grade Point Average (Project CGPA) till this term:** **0.0**
    *   *Observation:* The user has a respectable overall CGPA of 7.8. However, their Project CGPA is 0.0, which could indicate they haven't taken any project-based courses yet, or no project grades have been recorded for the current term.

**Current Courses and Performance:**

The user is enrolled in two courses, with their current assignment grades displayed:

1.  **Business Data Management**
    *   **Course Status:** **REPEAT FULL COURSE**
        *   *Observation:* This indicates the student is retaking the entire course. This might be to improve a previous grade or fulfill a prerequisite.
    *   **Grades:**
        *   Week 1 Assignment - **25.00**
        *   Week 2 Assignment - **50.00**
    *   **Navigation:** Go to Course page >

2.  **Tools in Data Science**
    *   **Course Status:** **NEW COURSE**
        *   *Observation:* This is a course the student is taking for the first time.
    *   **Grades:**
        *   Week 1 Assignment - **35.00**
        *   Week 2 Assignment - **45.00**
        *   Week 3 Assignment - **0.00**
        *   Week 4 Assignment - **20.00**
        *   Week 5 Assignment - **50.00**
        *   PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - **Absent**
    *   *Observation:* There are significant issues in this course, with a 0.00 for Week 3 Assignment and an "Absent" status for Programming Quiz 1. This suggests missed submissions or participation.
    *   **Navigation:** Go to Course page >

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code, command, or error messages in the traditional programming sense within this screenshot. All transcribed elements are academic grades or status messages.

*   `Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) till this term - 7.8`
*   `Project Cumulative Grade Point Average (Project CGPA) till this term - 0.0`
*   `Business Data Management`
*   `REPEAT FULL COURSE`
*   `Week 1 Assignment - 25.00`
*   `Week 2 Assignment - 50.00`
*   `Go to Course page >`
*   `Tools in Data Science`
*   `NEW COURSE`
*   `Week 1 Assignment - 35.00`
*   `Week 2 Assignment - 45.00`
*   `Week 3 Assignment - 0.00`
*   `Week 4 Assignment - 20.00`
*   `Week 5 Assignment - 50.00`
*   `PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent`
*   `Go to Course page >`*

Scores have not yet been pushed for everyone. You have to wait till operations push it (most likely Tuesday).

Kind regards
