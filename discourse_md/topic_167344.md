> **Image Content:** *As an expert at analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, I must point out that the provided image does not appear to be a screenshot from such a forum.

Instead, the image depicts:

*   **Key Information:** A domestic cat, likely a Scottish Fold given its ear shape, standing upright on its hind legs on a light brown wooden floor. The cat has short fur, with a white belly and chest, and grey/tabby markings on its back, tail, and head. Its front paws are held together near its mouth in a posture often associated with "begging" or "pleading." The cat's eyes are looking directly at the viewer.
*   **Context:** There is no visible user interface, text, code, commands, or error messages typically found in a data science course forum. The image is purely a photograph of an animal.

Therefore, I cannot transcribe any code, commands, or error messages as none are present in this image.*

It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.

I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.
