# Topic: Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]

### Post #1 by **Anand S** (Course_faculty, faculty)
*January 19, 2025, 08:17 UTC*
Please post any questions related to [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at [tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip ¬∑ sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don‚Äôt rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
   * Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
   * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

> **Image Content:** *Based on the screenshot from the data science course forum, here's the key information and transcription:

**Key Information:**

This instruction (labeled "A1") outlines the first step for users. It involves:
1.  **Installing a tool:** Users are instructed to install "uv" if it's not already present.
2.  **Running a Python script:** They then need to execute a Python script named `datagen.py` which is hosted on GitHub.
3.  **Providing an argument:** The script requires a single argument, which is a placeholder for the user's email address.
4.  **Purpose of the script:** A note clarifies that running this script will generate necessary data files for subsequent tasks in the course.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and URLs:**

*   **Tool to install:** `uv`
*   **Script URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`
*   **Argument placeholder:** `${user.email}`*



  
sir [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

Hi Guddu ,

I didn‚Äôt make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Kind regards

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir‚Äôs proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase ‚Äúrecent log file‚Äù, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

For more information watch this video <https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat> or watch TDS Live Sessions.

*January 27, 2025, 03:04 UTC*
Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot details the deliverables and constraints for a data science course assignment, focusing on building and deploying an API that likely interacts with an AI language model.

---

### Key Information

**1. Assignment Overview & Core Task:**
*   The assignment requires developing an application that exposes an API with at least two endpoints: `/run` (POST) and `/read` (GET).
*   The `/run` endpoint is expected to perform "tasks" (likely using an LLM) and the `/read` endpoint should verify the creation of "correct files" by the `/run` operation.
*   The application must be containerized and publicly deployable.

**2. Required Technologies & Tools:**
*   **Version Control:** Git and GitHub (for repository creation, committing, and pushing code).
*   **Licensing:** An MIT `LICENSE` file is required.
*   **Containerization:** `Dockerfile` for building the application image, `podman` for running the container, and `Docker Hub` for public image publication.
*   **API Interaction:** HTTP `POST` and `GET` requests to specific local endpoints (`http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`, `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`).
*   **AI/LLM:** An "AI Proxy" service, specifically using the `GPT-4o-Mini` model. The term "LLM" in the context of this page refers exclusively to `GPT-4o-Mini`.
*   **Credential Management:** The `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable is used for authentication with the AI Proxy. Students are explicitly told *not* to commit this token to their repository but to set it before script execution, with an example of accessing it in Python (`os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]`).

**3. Deliverables:**
*   A new GitHub repository containing the project code.
*   An MIT `LICENSE` file in the repository.
*   Working code implementing the specified API endpoints (`/run` and `/read`).
*   A `Dockerfile` to build the application.
*   A publicly accessible Docker image on `Docker Hub`.
*   Submission via a Google Form, providing the URLs for both the GitHub repository and the Docker image.

**4. Important Constraints & Guidelines:**
*   **Token Security:** Do not commit the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the repository.
*   **Token Usage Limit:** The AI Proxy token has a $1 usage limit. Students should try to avoid exceeding this.
*   **Model Specificity:** Only `GPT-4o-Mini` is supported by the AI Proxy.
*   **Performance:** Each call to the `/run` and `/read` endpoints must complete within 20 seconds.
*   **Prompting:** Prompts to the LLM should be kept short and concise.

---

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages

*   **File/Artifact Names:**
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `Dockerfile`

*   **API Endpoints/Methods (Conceptual):**
    *   `POST /run?task=...`
    *   `GET /read?path=...`
    *   `/run`
    *   `/read`

*   **Container Runtime Command:**
    *   `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

*   **Expected API URLs (Localhost):**
    *   `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`
    *   `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`

*   **Example Submission URLs:**
    *   `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`
    *   `user-name/repo-name` (for Docker image, implying `docker.io/user-name/repo-name` structure)

*   **Environment Variable and Access Example:**
    *   `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
    *   `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]`

*   **No specific error messages are present in the provided screenshot.***



Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

In Tuesday‚Äôs(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
2. Pull an existing docker image.
3. Run that image inside a container.
4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
5. Once done you can commit it.
6. And push customized container‚Äôs image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it‚Äôs a good idea, we will see if it‚Äôs possible to discuss in session.

Hi [@Divya1](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/divya1)



> **Image Content:** *[Image description failed due to an API or network error]*



Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot outlines the **pre-requisites** that a participant's submission (likely a data science project or solution) must meet to be eligible for evaluation. These criteria cover both the **GitHub repository** and the associated **Docker image**.

The core purpose of this section is to provide clear instructions on how the submissions will be structured and run, ensuring consistency and ease of scoring for the evaluators.

**Detailed Pre-requisites:**

1.  **GitHub Repository Accessibility:** The participant's GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible.
2.  **License File:** The GitHub repository must include a `LICENSE` file, specifically containing the MIT license.
3.  **Dockerfile Validity:** The GitHub repository must contain a valid `Dockerfile`.
4.  **Docker Image Accessibility & Runnability:** The Docker image built from the project must be publicly accessible and must be runnable using a specific `podman` command provided. This command demonstrates how the evaluators will attempt to execute the submitted solution.
5.  **Dockerfile Consistency:** The Docker image must be built using the exact same `Dockerfile` that is present in the participant's GitHub repository. This ensures transparency and reproducibility.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

The command specified for running the Docker image is:

`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`*



We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards

For A6, /data/docs/ has subfolders with .md files from which we have to extract the heading level 1‚Äôs (#) right? Apparently there are few files with different content but the same name.

Hi [@JoelJeffrey](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/joeljeffrey) ,

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

---

### Post #39 by **Joel Jeffrey** (ds-students)
*January 31, 2025, 06:55 UTC*
Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a specific task or assignment, labeled "A6.", from a data science course.

**Key Information:**

*   **Task Goal:** To create an index file in JSON format that maps Markdown filenames to their corresponding first header titles.
*   **Input Files:** All Markdown files (ending with `.md`) located in the `/data/docs/` directory.
*   **Title Extraction Logic:** For each Markdown file, the "title" is defined as the first line that begins with a hash symbol (`#`), which is standard Markdown syntax for a header.
*   **Output File:** An `index.json` file to be created within the `/data/docs/` directory itself.
*   **Output Format:** The `index.json` file should be a JSON object (dictionary) where:
    *   **Keys:** Are the Markdown filenames (without their full path, e.g., "README.md", not "/data/docs/README.md").
    *   **Values:** Are the extracted first header titles from those Markdown files.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Text:**

*   **Assignment Label:** `A6.`
*   **Markdown File Extension:** `.md`
*   **Input Directory Path:** `/data/docs/`
*   **Header Indicator:** `#`
*   **Output File Path:** `/data/docs/index.json`
*   **Example JSON Structure:**
    ```
    {"README.md": "Home", "large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}
    ```*

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic ‚Äúls‚Äù command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y‚Äôall run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn‚Äôt know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying

[

> **Image Content:** *This image appears to be a promotional graphic or a module/topic header from a data science course forum, rather than a screenshot of a user interaction or an error message. It's designed to visually introduce or summarize the concept of tools used in the field of data science.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Core Subject:** The central theme is "Tools in Data Science," clearly indicated by the large, prominent text.
2.  **Visual Representation of Concepts:** The image is rich with abstract and stylized icons that represent various aspects, tasks, and types of tools used in data science:
    *   **Data Visualization & Analytics:** Bar charts, pie charts, circular meters/dashboards, graphs with upward trends (representing growth or metrics).
    *   **Data Processing & Structure:** Abstract geometric patterns, network graphs (symbolizing data connections, algorithms, or relationships), gears (representing processing, automation, or machine learning).
    *   **Data Collection & Manipulation:** Pencils/pens (coding, documentation, ideation), a magnifying glass (exploration, search), scissors/pliers (data cleaning, manipulation, feature engineering).
    *   **Technology & Infrastructure:** A laptop computer (the primary interface for data science work), abstract circuit board-like patterns (representing computation, machine learning models, or data flow).
    *   **Security & Global Reach:** A padlock (data security, privacy) and a globe (global data, data from various sources, or global applicability of data science).
3.  **Aesthetic and Purpose:** The graphic uses a clean, modern, and slightly retro flat design style with a vibrant color palette (yellow, orange, teal, red, blue, off-white). It serves as an inviting and informative visual summary for a course section on data science tools. It aims to convey the multi-faceted nature of data science, encompassing various stages from data acquisition to insight generation.
4.  **Context (Implied):** Given it's "from a data science course forum," this image likely acts as:
    *   A banner for a module titled "Tools in Data Science."
    *   A thumbnail for a video lecture on data science tools.
    *   An illustrative graphic accompanying a forum post discussing different tools.

### Transcribed Text, Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

The image contains no code, commands, or error messages. The only text visible is the main title:

*   **TOOLS** (in yellow, bold, sans-serif font)
*   **IN** (in white/light gray, slightly smaller, sans-serif font)
*   **DATA** (in orange, bold, sans-serif font)
*   **SCIENCE** (in orange, bold, sans-serif font)*

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I‚Äôm struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I‚Äôm confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don‚Äôt know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats.

Hello everyone, [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that‚Äôs already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like ‚Äúpath=/data/format.md‚Äù or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like ‚Äúpath=show the data in format.md‚Äù?
3. Are we concerned about what‚Äôs shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they‚Äôre flexible? Ex. ‚ÄúCount the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt‚Äù

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:  
"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.  
‚Ä¢ Fill the form that is on the Project Page  
But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.

Hi Dewang,



> **Image Content:** *As an expert in analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a description of the key information and a transcription of the relevant code, commands, and error messages from the provided image:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays the "Deliverables" section for "Project 1" within a "Tools in Data Science" course. It outlines the specific requirements and steps for students to complete and submit their project, which involves developing an API and deploying it using Docker.

The content is structured into a list of deliverables and a "Note" section providing crucial guidelines:

1.  **Project Setup & Version Control:** Students must create a *public* GitHub repository and include an MIT `LICENSE` file. They are expected to commit and push their code regularly.
2.  **API Development & Testing:** The project involves creating an API that handles two specific endpoints:
    *   `POST /run?task=...`
    *   `GET /read?path=...`
    Students need to test their code to ensure these endpoints function correctly, specifically checking if `GET /read?path=...` creates the necessary files.
3.  **Dockerization & Deployment:** The application must be containerized using a `Dockerfile`. The resulting Docker image needs to be published *publicly* to Docker Hub.
4.  **Local Execution Test:** Students must ensure their Docker image can be run locally using `podman` (or a compatible tool like Docker) and that the API serves correctly at `http://localhost:8000`.
5.  **Submission Process:** The final submission requires students to provide the URL of their GitHub repository and the name of their Docker image via a Google Form.
6.  **AI Proxy Token Usage (Critical Notes):**
    *   The `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is a crucial environment variable that **must not be committed** to the repository. It should be set before running the script (e.g., using `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]` in Python).
    *   There's a $1 limit on the AI Proxy token usage.
7.  **LLM Model Specification:** The course explicitly states that for any references to "LLM" (Large Language Model), students should "Stick to GPT-4o-Mini," as it's the only supported generation model by AI Proxy.
8.  **Performance Constraints:** Calls to the `/run` and `/read` API endpoints must complete within 20 seconds, emphasizing the need for efficient code and concise prompts.

The left navigation pane indicates that "Deliverables" falls under "Project 1," which is part of a broader curriculum including "Development Tools," "Deployment Tools," and "Large Language Models."

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

*   `LICENSE`
*   `POST /run?task=...`
*   `GET /read?path=...`
*   `Dockerfile`
*   `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`
*   `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`
*   `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`
*   `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`
*   `user-name/repo-name`
*   `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
*   `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]`
*   `/run`
*   `/read`*



Please *read* the Project page Deliverables carefully as well as the Evaluation Pre - Requisites.

Kind regards

[@21f3002390](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f3002390) - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won‚Äôt happen in the future anyway.

**What‚Äôs happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5) by removing this. I‚Äôll introduce caching later if required.

For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesn‚Äôt seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum illustrates a successful task execution involving an LLM (Large Language Model) for data extraction and file manipulation, followed by a validation step.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Task Objective:** The primary goal is to extract a credit card number from an image file named `/data/credit_card.png` using an LLM and then write this number, without spaces, into a text file named `/data/credit-card.txt`.

2.  **API Interaction - Task Submission (POST Request):**
    *   A `POST` request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/run`.
    *   The entire task description is passed as a URL-encoded string in the `task` query parameter.
    *   The request receives an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response, indicating success.

3.  **LLM/Agent Function Call (JSON Response):**
    *   The successful `POST` request returns a JSON object.
    *   It specifies that the LLM/agent has identified and prepared to call a function named `"extract_numbers_from_image"`.
    *   The arguments for this function are correctly inferred from the task description:
        *   `"input_file_path": "/data/credit_card.png"`
        *   `"output_file_path": "/data/credit-card.txt"`
    *   This shows the LLM successfully translated natural language intent into a structured tool call.

4.  **API Interaction - Result Retrieval (GET Request):**
    *   A `GET` request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/read` to retrieve the content of the `credit-card.txt` file.
    *   The `path` parameter specifies `/data/credit-card.txt`.
    *   This request also receives an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response, indicating the file was successfully read.

5.  **Validation/Result Comparison:**
    *   The content of `/data/credit-card.txt` is displayed.
    *   **Expected Value:** `402639933653956`
    *   **Actual Result:** `402639933653956`
    *   The `EXPECTED` and `RESULT` values match exactly, indicating that the LLM successfully extracted the correct credit card number from the image and saved it to the specified file without spaces. The red dot next to `/data/credit-card.txt` might indicate that a check or assertion was performed on this file, which passed in this case.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

how to handle this error  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot, presented as if for a data science course forum:

---

### **Key Information from Screenshot Analysis**

This screenshot displays a terminal output showing a Python script execution that failed due to a missing module.

**1. Command Executed:**
The user, `root@Vikash` in the directory `/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_Project`, attempted to run a Python script. The command indicates an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` was set to `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` before executing a Python script using the `uv` tool. The script itself was fetched directly from a GitHub raw content URL, suggesting it's likely part of a course project or assignment.

**2. Python Traceback:**
A `Traceback` is displayed, indicating where the error occurred within the Python script.

**3. Error Location:**
The error originated in a temporary file named `/tmp/evaluateWEPc39.py` on `line 20` within the main module (`<module>`). This temporary file is a local copy of the `evaluate.py` script downloaded from the GitHub URL.

**4. Problematic Code:**
The specific line of code that caused the error is an `import` statement:
```python
from datagen import (
    ...<9 lines>...
)
```
The `...<9 lines>...` suggests that multiple specific components or functions were being imported from the `datagen` module in a multi-line import statement.

**5. Error Message:**
The core problem is a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

> **Image Content:** *Here's the analysis of the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays an error message, likely received as a response from an API call within a programming environment (common in data science applications that interact with external services).

1.  **Error Type:** The primary error is identified as `'API Error: 429'`.
    *   **HTTP Status Code 429:** This is an HTTP status code that stands for "Too Many Requests." It indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, often due to rate limiting or exceeding a usage quota set by the API provider.
2.  **Detailed Message:** Nested within the error, there's a `"message"` field that provides more specifics:
    *   `"on 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"`
    *   This message clearly states that for the month of "February 2025", the user has consumed `$2.002295600000011` worth of API resources.
    *   The crucial part is that this amount "exceeds $2", indicating a strict monthly monetary limit of $2.
3.  **Conclusion:** The user has hit a billing or free-tier usage limit for the API service. They have exceeded their allotted $2 budget for the specified month, leading to the "Too Many Requests" (429) error.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

```
{'error': 'API Error: 429, {\n "message": "on 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}'}

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn‚Äôt a single full-fledged project session. It‚Äôs a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion.

We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382) [@23f2000237](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000237)) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards

**I am getting below error message from LLM end points **<https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions> or <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>** , while running my project .**



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays an error message, likely received in response to an API call. The message is formatted as a string representation of a Python dictionary or JSON object.

1.  **Error Type:** It explicitly states `'API Error: 429'`.
    *   **API Error:** Indicates an issue communicating with an Application Programming Interface.
    *   **429:** This is an HTTP status code meaning "Too Many Requests." It's typically returned when a user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, indicating rate limiting or, in this case, a usage quota being exceeded.

2.  **Detailed Message:** The nested message further clarifies the reason for the 429 error:
    *   `"on 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"`
    *   This indicates a **billing or usage limit** was exceeded during the month of February 2025.
    *   The **allocated limit** appears to be $2.00.
    *   The **actual usage** was `$2.002295600000011`, which is just slightly over the $2.00 limit.

**Implications for a Data Science Course Forum:**

*   This error is very common when using paid or freemium APIs (e.g., large language models, cloud services, data providers) where there's a cost associated with usage or a free tier with strict limits.
*   A student might encounter this if they are using an API key provided for the course, if they are using their own API key with a free trial/tier that has a small monetary limit, or if they've exhausted a specific resource allowance.
*   The solution would typically involve checking API usage dashboards, upgrading their plan, or waiting for the billing cycle to reset (if the limit is monthly).

**Transcription:**

```
{'error': 'API Error: 429, {\n "message": "on 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}'}
```*

  
Kindly help me to resolve this issue. I am unable to proceed with my project.

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was *updated* on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as ‚Äúcount\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt‚Äù I am unable to get a response.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the result of an API call, likely from a testing tool or a network log within a data science course environment.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **HTTP Status Code:** The `Code` field shows `200`. This indicates that the HTTP request was *successful* at the network/server level. The server received and processed the request and sent a response back without a fundamental error like "Not Found" (404) or "Internal Server Error" (500).
2.  **Response Body:** The `Details` section specifies `Response body`, which contains a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object.
3.  **Application-Level Error:** Despite the `200 OK` status, the response body contains an error message within the application's logic. The JSON explicitly states: `"error": "Could not understand the task"`. This means the API successfully responded, but it was unable to fulfill the request due to an issue with the task provided or its format. This often implies a problem with the input data, parameters, or the structure of the request payload sent by the user.

In summary, the API call completed successfully from a communication standpoint, but the application itself encountered an issue in processing the request's content, specifically indicating it couldn't interpret the task it was asked to perform.

---

### Transcription:

**HTTP Status Code:**
`200`

**Response Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "error": "Could not understand the task"
}
```*



  
Please advice. Thank you.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays two distinct instructions from what appears to be a data science or machine learning course assignment. Both instructions involve data extraction and writing to specified files.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Email Extraction Task (Partial View):** The top line describes a task to extract "the sender's email address" and write "just the email address" to a specific text file. This implies an upstream process (not shown) provides data from which the email needs to be isolated.
2.  **Task A8 - Credit Card Extraction using LLM:** This is a clearly defined, multi-step task:
    *   **Source:** An image file located at `/data/credit-card.png` is specified as containing a credit card number.
    *   **Processing Method:** The instruction explicitly requires passing this image to a "Large Language Model" (LLM). This suggests using an LLM with multi-modal capabilities (image understanding).
    *   **Extraction Goal:** The LLM's role is to extract the credit card number from the image.
    *   **Output Format:** The extracted credit card number must be written "without spaces".
    *   **Destination:** The final, unspaced credit card number should be saved to a text file at `/data/credit-card.txt`.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   `/data/email-sender.txt`
*   `A8.`
*   `/data/credit-card.png`
*   `LLM` (used as a reference to a type of model/tool)
*   `/data/credit-card.txt`*



On task A8, credit-card.png is given, but it is in credit\_card.  
it makes the errors. I checked that 2 to 3 tasks depend on these, and we create the ouput file with ‚Äò-‚Äô this only. please clarify that output and input files name ‚Äò-‚Äô or ‚Äò\_‚Äô [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Kind regards

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students‚Äô concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

* **<https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions>**
* **<https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>**  
  

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**
The screenshot displays an error message, likely returned from an API (Application Programming Interface) call. The core information conveyed is:

1.  **Error Type:** It's an "API Error: 429". HTTP status code 429 signifies "Too Many Requests," meaning the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, or in this specific case, exceeded a usage quota.
2.  **Specific Reason:** The accompanying message clarifies that the error is due to exceeding a spending limit.
3.  **Usage Details:** "On 2025-02 you used $2.0022956000000011, exceeding $2". This indicates that in February 2025, the user spent slightly over $2 ($2.0022956...), which went beyond their allocated budget or free tier limit of exactly $2. This is a common issue with paid API services (e.g., cloud services, AI models) where a free tier or a set budget is in place.
4.  **Context:** In a data science course, this error often arises when students are using external APIs (e.g., for data collection, natural language processing, or image recognition) that have usage limits, especially free tiers or trial accounts. The student needs to be aware of their API usage and associated costs.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Transcription):**

```
{'error': 'API Error: 429, {\n "message": "On 2025-02 you used $2.0022956000000011, exceeding $2"\n}'}
```*

  
  This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot is from a web page titled "Large Language Models" within a "Tools in Data Science" course, hosted at `tds.s-anand.net`. It provides instructions and guidelines for students on using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on cost management and proxy configuration.

Here's the key information:

**Overall Context:**
*   The page is a module on the "practical usage of large language models (LLMs)" as part of a "Tools in Data Science" course.
*   The navigation sidebar indicates it's part of a curriculum that includes topics like "Prompt engineering," "LLM Sentiment Analysis," "Vision Models," and "Embeddings."

**Key Information & Usage Guidelines:**

1.  **Cost and API Keys:**
    *   LLMs incur a cost.
    *   API keys have been created for students with an **`iitm.ac.in`** email address.
    *   These keys are for using specific models: **`gpt-4o-mini`** and **`text-embedding-3-small`**.
    *   **Usage Limit:** Your usage is strictly limited to **`$1 per calendar month`** for the course. Students are explicitly told "Don't exceed that."

2.  **AI Proxy Usage Instructions (Crucial for Configuration):**
    *   Students are instructed to use an "AI Proxy" instead of directly accessing OpenAI.
    *   **Instruction 1 (API Endpoint Replacement):**
        *   Replace your API endpoint:
            *   FROM: **`https://api.openai.com/...`**
            *   TO: **`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`**
    *   **Instruction 2 (API Key/Token Replacement):**
        *   Replace the API key variable/value:
            *   FROM: **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**
            *   TO: **`AIPROXY_TOKEN`** (This token will be provided separately).

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

*   `iitm.ac.in`
*   `gpt-4o-mini`
*   `text-embedding-3-small`
*   `$1 per calendar month`
*   `https://api.openai.com/...`
*   `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`
*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
*   `AIPROXY_TOKEN`

**Note:** There are no error messages present in this screenshot.*



In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards

1.  **User and Directory:** The user `abhro014` is operating from the directory `/mnt/d/My_folder/IITM online degree/Diploma/TDS/Project1`. This path suggests a local development environment, possibly running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) given the `/mnt/d/` prefix, within a structured directory for an "IITM online degree/diploma" related to "Tools in Data Science" (TDS), specifically "Project 1".
2.  **Command Executed:** The user attempted to run a Python script named `datagen.py` using the `uv run` command. This `datagen.py` script is being fetched directly from a GitHub raw content URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`). The URL indicates it's part of a public repository for a "Tools in Data Science" course, specifically for the `tds-2025-01/project-1` section. An argument `23f1002104@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is passed to the script, which looks like a student ID or an email address related to the IITM study portal.
3.  **Execution Process:** The `uv` tool first indicates it is "Reading inline script metadata from remote URL", implying it downloaded and prepared the script for execution.
4.  **Error Type:** The execution failed with a `PermissionError`.
5.  **Error Origin (High Level):** The error occurred because the script tried to create a directory.
6.  **Specific Code Location:** The error traceback points to line 284 within a temporary Python file `/tmp/datagen2eQ208.py` (which is likely the `datagen.py` script downloaded by `uv`). The problematic line of code is `os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)`. This line attempts to create a directory specified by `config["root"]`.
7.  **Root Cause:** The underlying error, `Permission denied: '/data'`, indicates that the program did not have the necessary permissions to create the directory `/data` at the root of the file system. This is a common issue when a user attempts to create directories in restricted system locations without elevated privileges (e.g., without `sudo`).

NEED HELP. CAN SOMEONE CONTACT OLLAMA AND ASK THEM TO CHECK THEIR CODE ITS HAS SOME SILLY MISTAKES IN CODE EXAMPLES. I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

[LINK TO PAGE WITH CODE EXAMPLE](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models)



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays code snippets from a data science course, specifically demonstrating how to set up and query a vector embedding database using Ollama for local embedding generation.

### Key Information:

1.  **Core Task:** The overall goal is to implement a basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline: storing documents in a vector database and then retrieving the most relevant document based on a query.
2.  **Technology Used:**
    *   **Ollama:** Utilized for generating embeddings locally. The `ollama.embed()` function is central to both storing and retrieving.
    *   **Embedding Model:** The `mxbai-embed-large` model is specified for generating embeddings, indicating a preference for a high-quality general-purpose embedding model.
    *   **Vector Database:** The code interacts with a `collection` object, which suggests a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Milvus, Qdrant, etc.) is being used. The `collection.add()` and `collection.query()` methods are standard for such databases.
3.  **Two-Step Process:**
    *   **Step 1: Store/Index:** Documents are iterated through, embedded, and then added to the vector database with their unique IDs, embeddings, and original text content.
    *   **Step 2: Retrieve:** A natural language query is provided, embedded, and then used to search the vector database for the most semantically similar document.
4.  **Embedding Consistency:** The same `mxbai-embed-large` model is used for both indexing (storing documents) and querying (retrieving documents), which is crucial for effective semantic similarity search.
5.  **Output Structure:** The retrieved data is extracted from a nested dictionary/list structure (`results['documents'][0][0]`), indicating that the query might return results for multiple queries (even if only one was sent) and potentially multiple documents per query.

### Transcriptions:

#### Code Block 1: Storing Documents

```python
# store each document in a vector embedding database
for i, d in enumerate(documents):
    response = ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input=d)
    embeddings = response["embeddings"]
    collection.add(
        ids=[str(i)],
        embeddings=embeddings,
        documents=[d]
    )
```

#### Code Block 2: Retrieving Documents

```python
Step 2: Retrieve

Next, add the code to retrieve the most relevant document given an example prompt:

# an example input
input = "What animals are llamas related to?"

# generate an embedding for the input and retrieve the most relevant doc
response = ollama.embed(
    model="mxbai-embed-large",
    input=prompt
)
results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[response["embedding"]],
    n_results=1
)
data = results['documents'][0][0]
```*



  
  
  
  
correct code in step 2 collection query step

```
response = ollama.embed(
  model="nomic-embed-text:latest",
  input=task
)
results = collection.query(
  query_embeddings=response["embeddings"], #here embeddings and also not list of list as response embeddings already gives correct format
  n_results=1
)
data = results['documents'][0][0]

```

*For task A2*:

* **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place

I am getting the following error:  
`üî¥ A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath', '/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`

However, running a **POST request** to <https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2> gives successful output.

`{"success":true,"message":"Formatted and verified successfully!"}%`

Here is my code snippet:

```
def format_file(filepath):
    while True:  # Loop until formatting and verification pass
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", filepath],
                check=False,  # Don't raise exception automatically
                capture_output=True,
                text=True
            )

            if result.returncode != 0:
                return {"success": False, "message": f"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}"}

            if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
                return {"success": True, "message": "Formatted and verified successfully!"}
            else:
                logging.info("Verification failed. Retrying formatting...") #Log the retry
                # If verification fails, the loop continues and prettier --write is executed again.

        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "message": str(e)}

def verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
    try:
        subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--check", filepath], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True) #Capture output
        return True  # File is formatted correctly
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Prettier check failed: {e.stderr}") # Log the error from prettier check

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>

    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

```

If i can‚Äôt automate this process, i don‚Äôt see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - \* **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors ([@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton), [@iamprasna](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/iamprasna)):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

Kind regards

hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
for A2 i am getting this particular error and i don‚Äôt know what i am doing wrong in this  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a console output detailing an attempt to format a Markdown file using the `prettier` tool, likely within an automated testing or educational environment.

Here's the key information:

1.  **Task Objective:** The primary goal is to "Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place."

2.  **API Interaction - Formatting Request:**
    *   A `POST` request was sent to `http://localhost:8000/run`.
    *   The request's `task` parameter was URL-encoded, detailing the formatting operation.
    *   The server responded with `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, indicating the request was successfully received and processed at the API level.
    *   The response body (JSON) confirmed the function executed was `"format_file_with_prettier"` with arguments specifying `"file_path": "/data/format.md"` and `"prettier_version": "3.4.2"`.

3.  **API Interaction - Reading File Request:**
    *   A subsequent `GET` request was sent to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md`.
    *   This request was likely made to retrieve the file's content after the formatting attempt, presumably for verification.
    *   This request also returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, meaning the file content was successfully retrieved.

4.  **Verification Outcome (Failure):**
    *   The system then compares the retrieved content (`RESULT`) with the `EXPECTED` state.
    *   A red dot next to `/data/format.md` clearly indicates a failure or discrepancy for this file.
    *   The `EXPECTED` section is empty, suggesting that the expectation was for the file to be formatted, and thus its content should have changed or passed a formatting check.
    *   The `RESULT` section displays the actual content of `/data/format.md`, which is clearly **unformatted Markdown**. This includes:
        *   A heading `#Unformatted Markdown`.
        *   A paragraph with "extra spaces and trailing whitespace."
        *   A mixed-style list with `-`, `+`, and `*` bullet points.
        *   An unformatted Python code block.

**Conclusion:** Despite the HTTP requests indicating success in initiating and retrieving the file, the verification step shows that the `prettier` formatting operation **failed to correctly format the `/data/format.md` file in place**, as the retrieved content is still in its original, unformatted state.

issue with evaluate.py , post the code snippet in task a2, where it calculates the result and checks with expected.

---

### Post #160 by **Arya Agrahari ** (ds-students)
*February 12, 2025, 14:16 UTC*
you mean screenshot of evaluate.py file?  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a portion of a Python script in a code editor, likely Visual Studio Code, given the dark theme and bottom panel options ("PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL", "PORTS"). The script defines asynchronous functions (`async def`) and interacts with external processes using `subprocess`.

### Key Information:

1.  **File Formatting and Validation (`a2` function):**
    *   The primary logic revolves around an asynchronous function `a2` designed to format a markdown file and then validate if the in-place formatting was successful.
    *   It takes `email` (string, likely markdown content or a key to it), `file` (string, path to the markdown file, defaults to `/data/format.md`), and `**kwargs`.
    *   It first retrieves `original` markdown content using `get_markdown(email)`.
    *   It then uses `subprocess.run` to execute `npx prettier@3.4.2` on this `original` content (piped via stdin) to get the *expected* formatted output (`expected`). This is a common way to use Prettier for formatting.
    *   It then calls `await run(...)` with a descriptive f-string indicating the intent to format the `{file}` in-place using `prettier@3.4.2`. This `run` function is presumably a custom asynchronous utility that performs the actual file modification.
    *   After the potential in-place modification, it `await read(file)` to get the `result` (the actual content of the file).
    *   Finally, it compares `result` (actual formatted content) with `expected` (Prettier's output).
    *   If they don't match, it returns the result of a `mismatch` function (passing file, expected, and actual result).
    *   If they match, it returns `True`, indicating successful formatting and validation.
    *   There's a commented-out line `# check=True` for the `subprocess.run` call, which would typically raise an exception if the command exits with a non-zero status.
    *   A comment `# Ensure npx is picked up from the PATH on Windows` highlights a potential environment setup consideration.

2.  **Date Retrieval (`a3` function):**
    *   A second asynchronous function `a3` is partially visible.
    *   It takes `email` and `**kwargs`.
    *   Its first visible line is `dates = get_dates(email)`, suggesting it retrieves date information based on the `email` input.

3.  **Contextual Line (Line 75):**
    *   Line 75 shows `return email in await read("/data/format.md")`. This line appears to be part of a different, preceding function's logic, checking for the presence of `email` within the content of `/data/format.md`.

### Transcribed Code and Commands:

```python
75  return email in await read("/data/format.md")
76
77
78  async def a2(email: str, file: str = "/data/format.md", **kwargs):
79      original = get_markdown(email)
80      expected = subprocess.run(
81          ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--stdin-filepath", file],
82          input=original,
83          capture_output=True,
84          text=True,
85          # check=True,
86          # Ensure npx is picked up from the PATH on Windows
87          shell=True,
88      ).stdout
89      result = await run(
90          f"""
91          Format the contents of `{file}` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place
92          """
93      )
94      result = await read(file)
95      if result != expected:
96          return mismatch(file, expected, result)
97      return True
98
99
100 async def a3(email, **kwargs):
101     dates = get_dates(email)

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

Sir in main.py file I‚Äôm defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I‚Äôm testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I‚Äôm testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.  
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.  
Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,  
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don‚Äôt have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

* Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query‚Äôs response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,  
Trebhuvan

Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve *all tasks using the same function* !

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Hi [@Rishabh2](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/rishabh2)

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that‚Äôs an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

Hi [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382)  
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used.

Things to be checked at your end.  
1. `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine  
2. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot provides a crucial instruction from a data science course, likely related to deploying or testing a containerized application (an "image") that serves an API.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to ensure that a user-created image, when run, automatically exposes an API at a specific local address and endpoint.
2.  **Containerization Tool:** The command used is `podman run`, indicating the use of Podman, a daemonless container engine often used as an alternative to Docker.
3.  **Command Parameters:**
    *   `$IMAGE_NAME`: This is a placeholder for the actual name of the user's container image.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: This flag sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` inside the running container. Its value is taken from an environment variable of the same name available in the shell where the `podman run` command is executed. This suggests a requirement for an authentication token or a specific configuration for an AI proxy.
    *   `-p 8000:8000`: This flag maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. This is essential for accessing the application running inside the container from the host's network.
4.  **Expected API Endpoint:** The instruction specifies that the API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`.
    *   `http://localhost:8000`: Indicates the API is served locally on port 8000 (as mapped by the `-p` flag).
    *   `/run?task=...`: Specifies a particular endpoint (`/run`) and suggests that a query parameter named `task` is expected or part of the API's structure. The ellipsis `...` implies further details for the `task` parameter or additional parameters are omitted for brevity in this instruction snippet.
5.  **Behavior:** The word "automatically" emphasizes that the API should be ready and serving requests as soon as the `podman run` command successfully launches the container, without any further manual intervention required within the container.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:**

*   **Instruction Text:**
    ```
    - Ensure that running your image via
    podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 automatically
    serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and
    ```
*   **Specific Command Snippet (highlighted):**
    `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`
*   **Specific URL Snippet (highlighted):**
    `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`*



The command:  
`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

gives the error:  
`crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found`

However the correct command seems to be:  
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

This works totally fine.



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's the key information:

**Key Information:**

This screenshot displays the successful execution and startup of a server application within a containerized environment.

1.  **User and Host:** The command is being run by a user named `pradeeepmondal.iitm` on a machine identified as `Pradeeps-MacBook-Air`.
2.  **Working Directory/Project:** The user is operating from within a directory or project context named `llm-based-automation-agent`. This suggests the application is related to large language model (LLM) based automation.
3.  **Containerization Tool:** The command uses `podman`, indicating that the application is being run as a container. `Podman` is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers.
4.  **Application Execution:** A containerized application, likely a web service or API, is being started.
5.  **Environment Variable:** An environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is being passed into the container, suggesting authentication or access control for an AI proxy service. The value is taken from an existing shell variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
6.  **Port Mapping:** The application's port 8000 inside the container is mapped to port 8000 on the host machine (`-p 8000:8000`), making it accessible from outside the container.
7.  **Container Image:** The container image being run is `tds-project-pradeep-mondal`. This likely represents a specific project or application image for "The Data Science Project" by "Pradeep Mondal".
8.  **Server Startup Process:** The `INFO` messages confirm a successful sequence of events:
    *   A server process has started.
    *   The application has successfully completed its startup phase.
    *   The Uvicorn web server is running.
9.  **Application Access:** The application is accessible via `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. The `0.0.0.0` IP address indicates that the server is listening on all available network interfaces, meaning it can be accessed from the local machine or potentially other machines on the network if firewall rules allow.
10. **Termination Instruction:** The user is informed that they can press `CTRL+C` to quit the running server process.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

```
pradeeepmondal.iitm@Pradeeps-MacBook-Air llm-based-automation-agent % podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 tds-project-pradeep-mondal
INFO: Started server process [1]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir I get this error  
but my app.py is able to get the server running on localhost and not on 0.0.0.  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **User and Environment:** The user is `vikramjncasr` on the machine `ANJANEYA`. They are currently operating in the directory `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project`. The path `/mnt/c/` strongly suggests this is a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment, where the Windows C: drive is mounted. The directory name implies this is part of an "IIT Madras Data Science Project."
2.  **Action Attempted:** The user attempted to run a container using the `podman run` command, specifying a container/image ID of `20511982f949`. Podman is a container engine similar to Docker.
3.  **Error Type:** The command failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError` in Python.
4.  **Problem Origin:** The error occurred within a Python application located at `/app/app.py` inside the running container. Specifically, it happened on `line 1` during the module import phase.
5.  **Root Cause:** The Python script tried to `import fastapi`, but the `fastapi` module was not found in the container's Python environment. This indicates that the `fastapi` library was not installed within the container image or the container's Python environment.
6.  **Context:** This is a very common issue when deploying Python applications in containers. It usually means the necessary Python dependencies (like FastAPI) were not included in the container image build process (e.g., via a `requirements.txt` file and `pip install`).

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot, detailing the key information and transcribing the relevant code and messages:

---

### Key Information:

This screenshot captures a command-line interface session, likely from Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal, demonstrating the successful startup and initial interaction with a Python web application.

1.  **Project Context:** The user is operating within a directory named `C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project`. This strongly suggests the activity is part of an academic project or course related to Data Science (given "TDS" likely stands for "The Data Science" or "Time Series Data" or similar, and "IIT Madras" indicates an educational institution).

2.  **Server Technology:** The primary command executed is `uvicorn`, which is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server. This is commonly used for serving Python web frameworks like FastAPI, Starlette, or Quart, especially for asynchronous applications.

3.  **Application Hosting Details:**
    *   The command `uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` indicates that the server is configured to:
        *   Load an application instance named `app` from a Python module also named `app` (e.g., `app.py`).
        *   Bind to the localhost address (`127.0.0.1`), meaning it's only accessible from the machine it's running on.
        *   Listen for incoming requests on port `8000`.

4.  **Server and Application Status:**
    *   The server successfully started, indicated by "INFO: Started server process" and "INFO: Application startup complete."
    *   A confirmation message "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000" explicitly states the application's operational address.

5.  **Successful Request:** A subsequent log entry shows that an HTTP GET request was made to the root path (`/`) of the running application (`"GET / HTTP/1.1"`), originating from `127.0.0.1`. The response status `200 OK` confirms that the application successfully received and processed the request, indicating it is fully functional and accessible.

In essence, the user has successfully deployed and accessed a Python-based web application locally, likely as part of a data science project, potentially for serving a model, an API, or a dashboard.

---

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

```
INFO: Finished server process [30576]
PS C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project> uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir can you take my doubt in today‚Äôs session please , i have successfully run docker server but endpoints are not working‚Ä¶  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a data scientist's development environment, showing a Python FastAPI application, a web browser displaying an error, and a Git terminal session.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Web Browser (Chrome - Top Left)**
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:5000`
*   **Content Displayed:** A JSON error message.
*   **Transcription:**
    ```json
    {"detail":"Not Found"}
    ```
*   **Analysis:** This indicates that a request made to `localhost` on port `5000` (likely where the FastAPI application is expected to run) resulted in a "Not Found" error. This could mean the server isn't running, or it's running but the specific path requested (`/` in this case, as it's the root) isn't correctly mapped or accessible.

**2. VS Code Editor (`app.py` - Right Pane)**
*   **File Open:** `app.py`
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Framework:** FastAPI (indicated by `from fastapi import FastAPI`, `@app.get`, `@app.delete`).
*   **Key Code Sections (Transcription):**

    *   **Environment Variable Check (Lines 927-929):**
        ```python
        AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ.get("AIPROXY_TOKEN")
        if not AIPROXY_TOKEN:
            raise Exception("AIPROXY_TOKEN is required. Set it as an environment variable.")
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** This is a critical part of the application setup. It checks for an `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and will raise an `Exception` if it's not found. This could prevent the application from starting correctly, leading to the "Not Found" error seen in the browser.

    *   **Root GET Endpoint (Lines 930-932):**
        ```python
        @app.get("/")
        def read_root():
            return {"message": "Hello from the Automation Agent!"}
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** This defines the root endpoint (`/`) of the API, which should return a simple JSON message if successfully accessed.

    *   **Imports (Lines 934-936):**
        ```python
        from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Query
        from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse
        import logging
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** Standard imports for a FastAPI application, including `HTTPException` (for error handling), `Query` (for request parameters), `PlainTextResponse` (for specific response types), and `logging`.

    *   **FastAPI App Initialization (Line 938):**
        ```python
        app = FastAPI()
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** Instantiates the FastAPI application.

    *   **Logging Configuration (Lines 939-942):**
        ```python
        # Configure logging to record deletion attempts (for auditing, if needed)
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** Sets up basic logging at the INFO level, likely for auditing or debugging purposes, especially for actions like deletions.

    *   **Delete Endpoint (Partial - Line 944):**
        ```python
        @app.delete("/delete", response_class=PlainTextResponse)
        ```
        *   **Analysis:** Defines a DELETE endpoint at `/delete` that is configured to return a plain text response. The function body for this endpoint is not visible.

*   **VS Code UI Elements:**
    *   The project name in the title bar is `llm_project [WSL: Ubuntu]`. This indicates the user is working on an LLM (Large Language Model) project and is using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with an Ubuntu distribution.
    *   The "Codeium" extensions are visible, offering "Refactor | Explain | Generate Docstring" suggestions, indicating an AI coding assistant is in use.

**3. VS Code Terminal (Bottom Pane)**
*   **Shell:** `bash`
*   **Current Directory:** `~/llm_project`
*   **Active Environment:** `(env)` prefix indicates an active Python virtual environment.
*   **Command Executed:** `git push origin main`
*   **Output (Transcription):**
    ```

    ```
*   **Analysis:** The user successfully pushed their recent changes to a Git repository on GitHub (`Ansh205/LLM_project.git`). The output shows that 3 files were changed, including the creation of a `Dockerfile`, which suggests the project is being containerized (e.g., with Docker).

**Summary of Key Information:**

The user is developing a FastAPI application for an LLM project within a WSL Ubuntu environment. They have recently pushed code changes, including a `Dockerfile`, to GitHub. The application requires an `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable to be set. The current issue is that when trying to access the application via `http://localhost:5000`, a "Not Found" error is returned, likely because the application failed to start (possibly due to the missing `AIPROXY_TOKEN`) or the server isn't listening on that port.*

> **Image Content:** *Here's a detailed analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

### Key Information:

1.  **User & Environment:** The user is `vidushilinux` on the host `swastivivo`. They are currently working within a Python virtual environment named `tds-project-1`, which is also the current directory (`~/tds-project-1`). This is indicated by `(tds-project-1)` at the start of the command prompt.
2.  **Action Attempted:** The user tried to run a Python script named `app.py` using the `uv` command-line tool (likely `uv run app.py`). `uv` is a fast Python package installer and runner.
3.  **Error Type:** The program terminated with a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
4.  **Specific Problem:** The error indicates that the Python interpreter could not find a module named `fastapi`.
5.  **Location of Error:** The error occurred in the file `/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/app.py` on line 9.
6.  **Causing Code:** The specific line of code that triggered the error is `from fastapi import FastAPI`. This line attempts to import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` library.
7.  **Root Cause:** The `fastapi` library is not installed or not correctly accessible within the `tds-project-1` virtual environment where the `app.py` script is being executed.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

```

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a command-line interface session, likely from a Linux terminal environment within a data science course, given the path `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`. The user is interacting with the filesystem.

**Key Information:**

1.  **User and Environment:** The user is `vikramjncasi` on a machine named `ANJANEYA`. Their current working directory is `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`. The `/mnt/c/` prefix strongly suggests this is a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment, where the C: drive of the Windows host is mounted, a common setup for data science students using Windows to access Linux tools.
2.  **First Command - Attempted Deletion:** The user first attempts to forcefully and recursively delete a directory named `/data` from the root of their Linux filesystem using `sudo rm -rf /data`. This is a powerful command that requires superuser privileges (`sudo`) and will remove the target directory and all its contents without prompting (`-rf`).
3.  **Second Command - Directory Listing:** Immediately after the deletion attempt, the user lists the contents of the root directory (`/`) using `ls /`. This is likely a check to see the effect of the previous `rm` command or to inspect the root filesystem structure.
4.  **Output of `ls /`:** The output lists the standard directories found at the root of a typical Linux filesystem (e.g., `bin`, `boot`, `etc`, `home`, `mnt`, `opt`, `tmp`, `usr`, `var`). Notably, the `/data` directory that the user attempted to delete is **not present** in this listing.
5.  **Implication:** Since `/data` is not listed, it means that either:
    *   The `/data` directory never existed at the root of the Linux filesystem.
    *   It was already successfully removed prior to this session or by a previous command that is not shown.
    The `sudo rm -rf /data` command would have executed without an error message (due to the `-f` flag) even if `/data` didn't exist. The `ls /` confirms its absence.
6.  **Context for Data Science:** In a data science context, users often create or mount `/data` directories to store large datasets or project-specific files. This sequence of commands could indicate the user was trying to clean up an old dataset or prepare for a new one, but was targeting a directory that wasn't there or was in an unexpected location.

**Transcription:**

```
vikramjncasi@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1$ sudo rm -rf /data
vikramjncasi@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1$ ls /

Sir I haven‚Äôt initaiated the podman earlier.  
Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code ‚Äúsudo apt install -y podman‚Äù it is asking for the password‚Ä¶  
The problem is:

1. I haven‚Äôt set any password for podman earlier.
2. Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).  
   what should I am supposed to do‚Ä¶  

   

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a VS Code integrated terminal session, primarily focused on an issue with `sudo` password authentication within a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment. The user, `ayushcodes2611`, is attempting to execute administrative commands but is consistently failing to provide the correct password.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Environment:**
    *   The user is working in **Visual Studio Code**.
    *   The active panel is the **TERMINAL**.
    *   On the right sidebar, it's clear the user has two terminals configured: `powershell` and `wsl`. The `wsl` terminal is currently selected and active, indicating the commands are being run within a Linux distribution installed via WSL.
    *   The current working directory for the user is `/mnt/d/TDS/Project`, which suggests they are accessing a project located on their Windows D drive from within the WSL Linux filesystem.

2.  **User:**
    *   The user's username is `ayushcodes2611`.
    *   The host is `DESKTOP-Q9B00U6`.

3.  **Problem:**
    *   The primary problem is that the user is **repeatedly entering an incorrect `sudo` password**. This is evident from the "Sorry, try again." messages and the "sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts" error.
    *   After several failures, `sudo` eventually responds with "sudo: a password is required", preventing further command execution until a correct password is provided.

4.  **Commands Attempted:**
    *   The user initially encounters the password issue during general `sudo` attempts.
    *   They then specifically try to execute:
        *   `sudo apt update` (to update package lists)
        *   `sudo passwd` (likely to change or reset their password, which itself requires `sudo` for the current user)
        *   `sudo apt install -y podman` (to install `podman`, a containerization tool, which is a common task in data science setups).

5.  **Overall Context (Inferred for Data Science Course):**
    The user is likely in the process of setting up their environment for a data science project, which often involves installing various libraries and tools (like `podman` for containerization) that require root privileges (`sudo`). The inability to authenticate with `sudo` is a critical blocker to their progress.

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) I think the evaluation.py test case is broken for A8 because I can manually see more folders and markdown files than the expected case output of A8 evaluation.

> **Image Content:** *Here's a detailed analysis of the screenshot from the data science course forum:

This screenshot displays a series of command-line outputs, likely from an automated task runner or a local development server, attempting to execute a data science-related task involving an image, a Large Language Model (LLM), and file operations. Several errors are encountered, indicating configuration and potential path issues.

---

### Key Information

1.  **Task Objective:**
    *   The primary goal is to process an image file located at `/data/credit_card.png`.
    *   This image is stated to contain a credit card number.
    *   An LLM is to be used to extract the credit card number from the image.
    *   The extracted credit card number, *without spaces*, should then be written to a text file at `/data/credit-card.txt`.

2.  **Initial Task Execution (POST Request to Local Server):**
    *   A `POST` request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/run`.
    *   The entire task description (URL-encoded) is passed as a `task` query parameter.
    *   This request fails with an `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error`.

3.  **Root Cause of 500 Error:**
    *   The detailed error message reveals: `"Error extracting credit card: Image file .C:\\Users\\starb\\Desktop\\tds_p_1\\data\\credit_card.png does not exist."`
    *   **Critical Discrepancy:** While the task described the image path as `/data/credit_card.png` (a typical Unix-like path), the server attempting to process it looked for a specific Windows absolute path `C:\Users\starb\Desktop\tds_p_1\data\credit_card.png`. This indicates a misconfiguration or a discrepancy between the expected file location within the task runner's environment and the actual file system path where the image is stored or accessible. The leading `.` in `.C:\` is unusual but likely part of the error message's formatting of the absolute path.

4.  **Attempt to Read Output File (GET Request to Local Server):**
    *   A subsequent `GET` request is made to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt`.
    *   This request results in an `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` error.
    *   **Reason:** This 404 error is a direct consequence of the initial failure. Since the image could not be processed, the credit card number was never extracted, and thus the output file `/data/credit-card.txt` was never created.

5.  **Automated Test/Validation Failures (A8):**
    *   Following the 404, an automated check or test case, labeled `A8`, reports a failure: `"Cannot read /data/credit-card.txt"`. This confirms the inability to access the expected output.

6.  **External LLM/API Service Error (POST Request to External Proxy):**
    *   A separate `POST` request is sent to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This URL suggests an external proxy for an OpenAI embeddings service, likely used for LLM interaction.
    *   This request fails with an `"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"` error.
    *   **Reason:** This indicates an authentication issue, meaning the request lacked valid API keys or credentials required to access the OpenAI (or proxy) service. This is an independent problem from the file path issue, but equally critical for LLM-based tasks.

7.  **Automated Test/Validation Failures (A9):**
    *   Following the 401 error, another automated check, labeled `A9`, reports a failure: `A9 failed: 'data'`. The specific reason 'data' is vague but is likely related to the inability to process data due to the unauthorized API access.

---

### Transcriptions (Code, Commands, Error Messages)

*   **Running task description:**
    `Running task: `/data/credit_card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt``

*   **First HTTP Request & Error:**
    `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=%60%2Fdata%2Fcredit_card.png%60+contains+a+credit+card+number.+Pass+the+image+to+an+LLM%2C+have+it+extract+the+card+number%2C+and+write+it+without+spaces+to+%60%2Fdata%2Fcredit-card.txt%60 "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"`

*   **Detailed 500 Error Message:**
    `HTTP 500 {`
    `"detail": "Error extracting credit card: Image file .C:\\Users\\starb\\Desktop\\tds_p_1\\data\\credit_card.png does not exist."`
    `}`

*   **Second HTTP Request & Error:**
    `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found`

*   **A8 Failure:**
    `A8 failed: Cannot read /data/credit-card.txt`
    `X A8 FAILED`

*   **Third HTTP Request & Error:**
    `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"`

*   **A9 Failure:**
    `A9 failed: 'data'`
    `X A9 FAILED`*

Are you subscribed to the TDS channel? If you were it would notify you immediately when it was uploaded. (10am this morning).

Please subscribe to the channel. It was also on the main page for TDS.  
<https://tds.s-anand.net/#/README>



> **Image Content:** *Based on the provided image, here's the analysis:

**Key Information:**

The image displays an extremely blurry and pixelated icon, primarily featuring a prominent red horizontal rectangle. Centered within this red area is a bright white, right-pointing arrow. The entire red shape is surrounded by a blurry green border or background.

Due to its characteristic shape, color scheme (red and white), and the presence of a right-pointing arrow, the icon **strongly resembles a "play" button**, commonly used for video content. It bears a very strong resemblance to the play button icon associated with YouTube.

In the hypothetical context of a data science course forum, this image would most likely represent a clickable link or an embedded player for a video lecture, tutorial, or demonstration related to the course material. The severe blurriness suggests it might be a small thumbnail or an artifact of low-resolution embedding/uploading.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There is **no discernible code, commands, or error messages** present in the image. The image consists solely of a graphical icon.*


[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@se-lr5ff)



> **Image Content:** *This image is a stylized graphic, likely a banner or thumbnail for a module or course on a data science learning platform. It uses a vibrant, flat design aesthetic with various icons and illustrations that visually represent concepts related to data science and technology.

**Key Information:**

*   **Main Topic:** The central and most prominent information is the title of the topic: **"TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE"**.
    *   "TOOLS" is displayed in large, bold, yellow uppercase letters.
    *   "IN" is smaller, white, and uppercase.
    *   "DATA SCIENCE" is in large, bold, orange uppercase letters.
*   **Visual Themes:** The surrounding illustrations provide visual cues related to data science:
    *   **Analysis & Visualization:** Icons resembling pie charts, bar graphs, and network diagrams (nodes connected by lines) are present, suggesting data analysis, relationships, and visualization. A magnifying glass further emphasizes analysis.
    *   **Computation & Programming:** A stylized laptop screen is visible behind the text, and pencils/writing tools are shown, hinting at coding and computational aspects.
    *   **Data & Networks:** A globe symbol and more network diagrams imply global data, interconnected systems, or the internet.
    *   **Security:** A padlock icon suggests data security or privacy considerations.
    *   **Growth & Trends:** Upward-pointing arrows likely represent growth, trends, or positive outcomes derived from data analysis.
    *   **Applications:** An icon resembling a mobile app screen with a central four-dot cluster could represent data applications or user interfaces.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this image. It is purely a graphical illustration.*

Hi,  
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.  
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file should be folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file as key.

Sir, my token limit has crossed the $1 limit. Will I receive new limit or a fresh token ? I still need to complete my project.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the API pricing page from `openai.com/api/pricing/`. It presents a comparison of two large language models, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, outlining their characteristics and usage costs.

**Key Information:**

1.  **URL:** The page is located at `https://openai.com/api/pricing/`.
2.  **User Interface:** The page is rendered in a dark mode theme with white text and light grey information cards. There's a navigation bar at the top with a search icon, a "Log in" button, and a user profile icon. A partially visible left sidebar seems to contain navigation links, including one to a "forum". A "Ask ChatGPT" button is visible at the bottom.
3.  **Model Comparison - GPT-4o:**
    *   **Description:** "High-intelligence model for complex tasks"
    *   **Context Length:** "128k context length"
    *   **Price (per 1 Million tokens):**
        *   **Input:** `$2.50`
        *   **Cached input:** `$1.25`
        *   **Output:** `$10.00`
4.  **Model Comparison - GPT-4o mini:**
    *   **Description:** "Affordable small model for fast, everyday tasks"
    *   **Context Length:** "128k context length" (Notably the same as GPT-4o, indicating the 'mini' distinction is primarily cost/performance, not context window size).
    *   **Price (per 1 Million tokens):**
        *   **Input:** `$0.150`
        *   **Cached input:** `$0.075`
        *   **Output:** `$0.600`

**Transcribed Text (all visible text that is not a UI element label):**

*   **URL Bar:** `openai.com/api/pricing/`
*   **GPT-4o Card:**
    *   `GPT-4o`
    *   `High-intelligence model for complex tasks |`
    *   `128k context length`
    *   `Price`
    *   `Input:`
    *   `$2.50 / 1M tokens`
    *   `Cached input:`
    *   `$1.25 / 1M tokens`
    *   `Output:`
    *   `$10.00 / 1M tokens`
*   **GPT-4o mini Card:**
    *   `GPT-4o mini`
    *   `Affordable small model for fast, everyday`
    *   `tasks | 128k context length`
    *   `Price`
    *   `Input:`
    *   `$0.150 / 1M tokens`
    *   `Cached input:`
    *   `$0.075 / 1M tokens`
    *   `Output:`
    *   `$0.600 / 1M tokens`
*   **Left Sidebar (partially visible):**
    *   `on ‚Üó`
    *   `rum ‚Üó` (Likely "Forum")
*   **Bottom Bar:**
    *   `Ask ChatGPT`
    *   `Over 50%` (text cut off)

For as task description like this

* Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the ‚Äú#‚Äù symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.  
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a VS Code (or similar IDE) environment, showing a Python script (`main.py`) in the upper pane and its execution output in the "TERMINAL" tab in the lower pane. The core issue appears to be that a `prettier` formatting command executed by the Python script is not producing the expected changes to a Markdown file.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Key Information:

1.  **Context:** The user is attempting to format a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using a Python script that invokes the `prettier` tool. The terminal output compares the "expected" (unformatted) content of the file with the "result" after the script runs.

2.  **Python Script (`main.py`) Analysis:**
    *   **Function:** `handle_task_A2(file_path:str, prettier_version:str)`
        *   This function is designed to take a file path and a `prettier` version string.
    *   **File Existence Check:** It first checks if `file_path` is provided and if the file `os.path.exists(file_path)`.
    *   **Execution Logic (if file exists):**
        *   It prints a confirmation message: `'Path exisit - will perform prettier'` (Note: "exisit" is a typo for "exist").
        *   It executes an external command using `subprocess.run`: This is the core logic that attempts to format the file.
    *   **Error Handling (if file does not exist):**
        *   If the file is not found, it raises a `FileNotFoundError()`.

3.  **Terminal Output Analysis:**
    *   **Target File:** `/data/format.md`
    *   **`‚ñ≤EXPECTED:` Section:** This section displays the content of the Markdown file *before* formatting (or what the test expects the input to be). It explicitly states `#Unformatted Markdown` and describes itself as containing "extra spaces and trailing whitespace." It includes various Markdown elements like:
        *   A paragraph with potential whitespace issues.
        *   Bullet lists with different markers (`-`, `+`, `*`) and potentially inconsistent indentation.
        *   A Python code block.
    *   **`‚ñ≤RESULT:` Section:** This section displays the content of the Markdown file *after* the `prettier` command was executed by the Python script.
    *   **Crucial Observation:** The content under `‚ñ≤RESULT:` is **identical** to the content under `‚ñ≤EXPECTED:`. This indicates that the `prettier` command, as invoked, did *not* modify or format the `/data/format.md` file, despite the "EXPECTED" content explicitly being described as "unformatted."

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

**From `main.py` (Python Code):**

```python
200
201 def handle_task_A2(file_path:str, prettier_version:str):
202     if file_path and os.path.exists(file_path):
203         print('Path exisit - will perform prettier')
204         subprocess.run(["npx", f"prettier@{prettier_version}", "--write", file_path])
205     else:
206         raise FileNotFoundError()
207
```

**From TERMINAL Output:**

```
/data/format.md
‚ñ≤EXPECTED:
#Unformatted Markdown

This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.

- First item
- Second item
+Third item

* Fourth item

```py
print("user@example.com")
```

‚ñ≤RESULT:
#Unformatted Markdown

This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.

- First item
- Second item
+Third item

* Fourth item

```py
print("user@example.com")
```

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‚Äò#‚Äô and change it to ‚Äònumber‚Äô and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‚Äòcount the # of‚Äô in a task, please interpret it as ‚Äòcount the number of‚Äô. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, showing a Python script (`llm.py`) and its execution output in the integrated terminal. The user appears to be attempting to download and run another Python script as part of a data science course project.

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** The user is working in VS Code, running on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Ubuntu 24.04.
2.  **Purpose of `llm.py`:** This script is designed to:
    *   Download a remote Python script named `datagen.py` from a specified GitHub URL.
    *   Execute the downloaded `datagen.py` script using the Python interpreter, passing an email-like string (`21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) as a command-line argument.
3.  **Required Python Version:** The comments in `llm.py` indicate a `required-python = ">=3.11"`.
4.  **Module Used:** The script heavily relies on Python's built-in `subprocess` module to execute external commands (`wget`, `python`).
5.  **Observed Execution State:**
    *   The terminal shows some `INFO` messages with `200 OK` status, suggesting successful communication with a backend or task registration system (perhaps related to an online course platform). These messages describe tasks like processing a file of dates and running the `datagen.py` script.
    *   **Crucially, there is a `NameError` traceback.** This error indicates that the `subprocess` module was not defined when `subprocess.run()` was called.
    *   **Discrepancy between Code and Error:** The `llm.py` file *visible in the editor* (lines 8-18) *does* include `import subprocess` on line 8 and the `subprocess.run` calls on lines 15 and 18. However, the `NameError` traceback points to `/app/llm.py`, line 15, and shows a call like `subprocess.run(['python3', script_path, email_argument])`. This suggests the terminal output is from a *previous, failed execution* of a slightly different version of `llm.py` (or a different execution context within `/app`) where the `import subprocess` line might have been missing or where the script execution was on line 15, rather than the `wget` command. The current code in the editor appears to be an updated version that should theoretically fix the `NameError`.

### Transcriptions:

#### `llm.py` Code (Visible in Editor):

```python
1 # /// script
2 # required-python = ">=3.11"
3 # description = [
4 # "subprocess",
5 # 
6 # ]
7 # ///
8 import subprocess

10 # Define the script URL and the argument
11 script_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py'
12 arg = '21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'
13 
14 # Use wget to download the script and prepare to run it
15 subprocess.run(['wget', script_url, '-O', 'datagen.py'])
16 
17 # Now, run the downloaded Python script with the provided argument
18 subprocess.run(['python', 'datagen.py', arg])
```

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

Kind regards

sir i am getting this error by running the docker image  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python `Traceback` error message, commonly seen in development environments or deployment logs.

**Key Information:**

*   **Error Type:** `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   **Root Cause:** The Python interpreter cannot find a module named `fastapi`.
*   **Location of Error:** The error occurred in the file `/app/app.py` on `line 11`. The path `/app/app.py` is common in containerized environments (e.g., Docker containers) or specific project setups.
*   **Problematic Code:** The specific line of code that triggered the error is an import statement: `from fastapi import FastAPI`.

**Analysis for a Data Science Course Forum:**

This error indicates that the Python environment where the application is being run does not have the `fastapi` library installed. In a data science context, FastAPI is a very popular and widely used modern web framework for building APIs, especially for deploying machine learning models. Students often use it to expose their trained models as web services that other applications can consume.

The user is attempting to import the core `FastAPI` class, which is the entry point for building any application with this framework. The `ModuleNotFoundError` is a direct result of the `fastapi` package not being present in the Python interpreter's `site-packages` directory or its configured search path.

**Common Solutions:**

The most straightforward solution is to install the `fastapi` library using `pip`, Python's package installer:

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

Often, when deploying FastAPI applications, you also need an ASGI server like Uvicorn. The full command might be:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]"
# or
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

If this code is part of a containerized application (e.g., in Docker), the `Dockerfile` would need to include an instruction to install `fastapi` (and potentially `uvicorn`) before running the application, for example:

```dockerfile
# ... other Dockerfile instructions ...
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn
# ... rest of the Dockerfile ...
```*

I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a data science project running within Visual Studio Code, leveraging Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It demonstrates a script that downloads and executes another script, likely part of an automated task or an assignment in a data science course. A web server is also running, indicating an API component to the project.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Development Environment & Project Context:**
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
*   **Operating System/Environment:** Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) running Ubuntu 24.04. This is indicated by `LLM_1 [WSL: Ubuntu-24.04]` in the title bar and `WSL: Ubuntu-24.04` in the status bar.
*   **Python Environment:** A Python virtual environment named `llm_venv` is active, as seen in the terminal prompt `(llm_venv)`.
*   **Project Path:** The project is located at `/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_1`, suggesting it's part of an academic course (IIT Madras) related to "Tools in Data Science" (TDS).
*   **Project Files:**
    *   `app.py`: Likely the main application file, possibly a web application.
    *   `llm.py`: The currently open file, which orchestrates the download and execution of another script.
    *   `datagen.py`: A script that is downloaded and executed by `llm.py`.
    *   `data/`: A directory where generated files are expected to be stored.
    *   `Dockerfile`: Suggests containerization (Docker) is part of the project setup.
    *   `req.txt`: Indicates Python dependencies are managed.

**2. `llm.py` Script Functionality:**
The `llm.py` script performs the following actions:
*   It imports `os` and `subprocess` for system interactions.
*   It prints the absolute path of a `/data` directory.
*   It defines a `script_url` pointing to a `datagen.py` script on a GitHub repository, specifically within a `tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1` path, further confirming the course context.
*   It defines an `email_arg` with an IIT Madras academic email address (`21F3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`).
*   It uses `curl` via `subprocess.run` to download the `datagen.py` script from the `script_url` to the current directory (`-O`).
*   It then executes the downloaded `datagen.py` script using the `uv run` command (a modern, fast Python package installer and runner), passing the `email_arg` to it.

**3. Terminal Output & Execution Flow:**
The terminal output reveals a multi-stage execution:
*   **Uvicorn Server Startup:** The command `uv run app.py` was executed, which started a Uvicorn web server.
    *   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000` indicates a web application is listening on port 8000.
*   **Script Execution (`llm.py`):** The `CompletedProcess` output confirms that `llm.py` (or a similar script designed to run it) was executed.
    *   `returncode=0`: Indicates successful execution.
    *   `stdout`: Contains a "DISCLAIMER" about the script changing before evaluation (common in course assignments) and confirms **"Files created at /data/data"**, indicating the `datagen.py` script successfully generated output in the specified directory.
    *   `stderr`: Shows the progress of the `curl` command (executed by `llm.py`), confirming `datagen.py` was downloaded (8820 bytes, 100% received).
*   **Web API Interaction:** A `POST` request was made to the `/run` endpoint of the Uvicorn server.
    *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:55594 - "POST /run?task=run%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py%20with%20'21F3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'%20as%20the%20only%20argument. HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   This log entry is crucial: It shows the web server (`app.py`) received a request to **run** the `datagen.py` script (identified by its URL) with the specified email as an argument. This implies `app.py` is acting as an API gateway that can trigger the data generation process. The `200 OK` confirms the API request was successful.

**Key Takeaways:**
The user is working on a data science project within a structured course environment. The setup involves a web application (`app.py`) that likely provides an API endpoint to trigger a data generation task. This task, handled by `llm.py`, dynamically downloads `datagen.py` and executes it, saving results to a `data` directory. The entire process completed successfully, including the web request, script download, and script execution.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot, detailing key information, code, commands, and error messages.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment and Project:**
    *   The user is working within a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment.
    *   The project is named `LLM_1` and is being managed via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), specifically `Ubuntu-24.04`.
    *   A Python virtual environment named `.llm_venv` is active, indicated by `(llm_venv)` in the terminal prompt.
    *   The current working directory in the terminal is `/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_1`. This suggests a course-related project structure.

2.  **Files and Structure:**
    *   The file explorer shows several Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `llm.py`), a `Dockerfile`, and a `re.txt` file (likely for requirements).
    *   `Dockerfile` is currently open and being edited/viewed.

3.  **Docker Configuration (`Dockerfile`):**
    *   The `Dockerfile` is setting up a Python application inside a Docker container.
    *   It uses `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as the base image.
    *   It installs `curl` and `ca-certificates` (necessary for secure downloads).
    *   It downloads and installs `uv`, a fast Python package installer and executor, from `astral.sh`.
    *   It adds `uv`'s installation path (`/root/.local/bin/`) to the system's `PATH`.
    *   It sets `/app` as the working directory within the container.
    *   It copies `re.txt` and `app.py` into the container.
    *   It runs `pip install` to install dependencies from `re.txt`.
    *   It creates a directory `/data`.
    *   The final command (`CMD`) to be executed when the container starts is `uv run app.py`.

4.  **Terminal Activity and Application Execution:**
    *   The user executed the command `uv run app.py` locally in the terminal.
    *   The application, likely a web service, started successfully using Uvicorn on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
    *   A `CompletedProcess` output is visible, which indicates an internal execution.
        *   This internal process executed `uv run llm.py` (note the difference from `app.py` that was explicitly launched). This suggests `app.py` might be orchestrating the execution of `llm.py` or `llm.py` is the actual core application being run.
        *   The stdout of this internal process includes a `DISCLAIMER` stating "THIS SCRIPT WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE EVALUATION. TREAT THIS AS A GUIDE." and "Files created at /data".
        *   It also shows output resembling a file transfer progress bar, indicating a download or upload operation.
    *   Crucially, there's an `INFO` message detailing an `HTTP POST` request to download `datagen.py` from a GitHub raw content URL. This request includes an argument that looks like a student ID or email: `21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This strongly implies the execution is part of a data science course assignment involving data generation.

5.  **No Error Messages:**
    *   All processes and operations shown in the terminal completed successfully. There are no explicit error messages. The `returncode=0` for the `CompletedProcess` confirms success.

Hello,  
just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data` in root directory, will it be fine ?  
or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?  
Thanks

### Post #355 by **Carlton D'Silva** (Regular, ds-students)
*February 15, 2025, 04:22 UTC*
The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.  
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

### Post #356 by **Atimanas Biswal** (ds-students)
*February 15, 2025, 04:52 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a submission form for a data science course, likely for "Project 1," where a student is required to provide links and names for their project deliverables.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Context:** The form is collecting information about a student's GitHub repository and their DockerHub image, both related to "Project 1." Both fields are marked with an asterisk (*), indicating they are required.

**Section 1: GitHub Repository Link**

*   **Question:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1? *"
*   **Expected Format Hint:** "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
*   **Student Input:**
    ```
    https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1
    ```
    *   **Analysis:** This input appears to be correctly formatted and accepted by the form, as no error message is displayed for this field. The student's GitHub username is `Atimanas-Biswal421`, and the repository name for Project 1 is `proj1`.

**Section 2: DockerHub Image Name**

*   **Question:** "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub? *"
*   **Expected Format Hint:** "It should look like user-name/image-name"
*   **Student Input:**
    ```
    atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final
    ```
*   **Error Message:**
    ```
    Must match pattern
    ```
    *   **Analysis:** The student's input for the DockerHub image name `atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final` does not match the required pattern specified in the hint. The hint explicitly states `user-name/image-name`, implying that image tags (like `:final`) should not be included in this specific input field. The user `atimanasbiswal` seems to be the DockerHub username, and `proj1-tds` is likely the intended image name. The error "Must match pattern" indicates a regex or string validation failure against the expected format. The student needs to remove the `:final` tag to resolve this error.*

*   **Open Files (Tabs):**
    *   `taskA2.py`
    *   `evaluate.py 1` (The "1" might indicate a modified file or a specific version/instance of evaluation)
    *   `datagen.py`
*   **Current File in View:** `credit_card.png` is selected in the file explorer and its path `data > credit_card.png` is displayed above the main content area.
*   **File Explorer (Partial List of Visible Files):**
    *   `_pycache_` (Python cache directory)
    *   `taskA1.py`
    *   `taskA2.py`
    *   `taskA3.py`
    *   `taskA4.py`
    *   `taskA5.py`
    *   `taskA6.py`
    *   `taskA7.py`
    *   `taskA8.py`
    *   `taskA9.py`
    *   `taskA10.py`
    *   `comments.txt`
    *   `contacts-sorted.json`
    *   `contacts.json`
    *   `credit_card.png` (Highlighted/Selected)
    *   `credit-card.txt`
    *   `dates-wednesdays.txt`
    *   `dates.txt`
    *   `email-sender.txt`
    *   `email.txt`
    *   `format.md`
    *   `logs-recent.txt`
    *   `ticket-sales-gold.txt`
    *   `ticket-sales.db`
    *   `node_modules`
    *   `PhaseA` (Likely a project phase or directory)

**2. Main Content Area:**
*   The main editor area displays what looks like the content of the `credit_card.png` file, which is a sequence of numbers:
    ```
    390 6522 2036 7260
    ```
    Below this, partially visible text includes:
    ```
    VALID
    HRU
    ```
    This suggests the image contains text, and the user might be performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or some form of data extraction from the image, or the image itself is intended to be processed for these numbers.

**3. Problems/Error Messages (Bottom Panel - `PROBLEMS 3` tab is active):**
*   **Problem 1 (Task A8 Failure):**
    ```
    üî¥ /data/credit-card.txt
    ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPECTED:
    4390652220367260078
    ‚ö†Ô∏è RESULT:
    4390652220367260
    ‚ùå A8 FAILED
    ```
    *   **Context:** This error relates to the `credit-card.txt` file (note: *not* `credit_card.png` for this specific error).
    *   **Issue:** A comparison failure. The `RESULT` obtained by the user's code (or system) `4390652220367260` does not match the `EXPECTED` value `4390652220367260078`. The `RESULT` is missing the last three digits (`078`) compared to the `EXPECTED` value.
    *   **Task:** This failure is explicitly tied to "A8 FAILED", indicating a problem in the solution for "Task A8" (likely corresponding to `taskA8.py`).

*   **Problem 2 (Task A9 Failure related to HTTP Request):**
    ```
    HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev
    üî¥ A9 failed: 'data'
    ‚ùå A9 FAILED
    ```
    *   **Context:** An HTTP POST request was made to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` (URL is partially visible).
    *   **Issue:** "A9 failed: 'data'". This suggests an issue with the data being sent in the POST request, or the API returned an error indicating a problem with the provided data.
    *   **Task:** This failure is explicitly tied to "A9 FAILED", indicating a problem in the solution for "Task A9" (likely corresponding to `taskA9.py`).

**Summary:**
The user is working on a series of programming tasks (likely Python-based, given the `.py` files) as part of a data science course. They are encountering issues with two specific tasks:
1.  **Task A8:** Failed due to a mismatch in numerical output when processing data from `credit-card.txt`, specifically a truncation or incorrect extraction of the last three digits.
2.  **Task A9:** Failed during an HTTP POST request to an external API, with the specific error pointing to an issue with the 'data' being sent in the request.

The selected `credit_card.png` file containing numbers suggests that one of the tasks might involve image processing or OCR to extract data, which could be related to the `credit-card.txt` issue or a subsequent task.*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the details of an HTTP response, likely from a browser's developer console or an API client like Postman or Insomnia, indicating an error during a request to a server.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Primary Status Code:** The request resulted in a `500 Internal Server Error`. This generally indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
2.  **Response Body Details:** Despite the generic `500` status, the `Response` tab reveals a more specific error message within the JSON payload. The `"detail"` field contains an embedded message indicating an `Error code: 401`.
3.  **Authentication Failure:** The nested `401` error message explicitly states: `"Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."` This is the root cause of the issue, meaning the credentials (authentication token) provided with the request were either invalid, expired, or not issued by a trusted authority.
4.  **Specific Error Type:** The JSON further specifies the type of error as `'invalid_request_error'` and the particular code as `'invalid_issuer'`. There is no specific parameter (`'param': None`) identified as the cause.
5.  **Response Metrics:**
    *   **Size:** The response body size was small, at `184 Bytes`.
    *   **Time:** The request took `792 ms` to complete.
6.  **Interface Elements:** The screenshot shows various tabs (`Response`, `Headers`, `Cookies`, `Results`, `Docs`), suggesting a tool for inspecting network requests. The `Response` tab is currently selected.

**In summary:** While the server returned a generic 500 error, the actual problem lies with the client's authentication token, which is not recognized as valid by the server. The server failed to process the request due to this invalid token, leading to the internal server error.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

*   **Status Line:**
    `Status: 500 Internal Server Error Size: 184 Bytes Time: 792 ms`

*   **Response Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    1 {
    2   "detail": "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}"
    3 }
    ```*

> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The screenshot displays a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted output, which is a common data interchange format in data science, web development, and API interactions.

1.  **Data Structure:** It's a simple JSON object containing a single key-value pair.
2.  **Key:** The key is `"message"`, indicating that the value associated with it is a descriptive text.
3.  **Value Content:** The value is a string that appears to be an automated notification or log entry related to usage or billing.
    *   **Timeframe:** "On 2025-02" specifies the period of the usage, likely February of the year 2025.
    *   **Usage Amount:** "you used $2.003749139999996". This shows a precise monetary amount, which includes many decimal places. The high precision (many trailing nines) often points to floating-point arithmetic results in computing, which can sometimes lead to tiny inaccuracies when exact decimal representation is expected (e.g., in financial calculations if not handled with fixed-point decimals).
    *   **Condition Met:** "exceeding $2". This indicates that the recorded usage amount has surpassed a threshold of $2. This message likely serves as an alert or a notification about exceeding a budget, quota, or a spending limit.

In a data science context, such a message could be:
*   An output from a script monitoring cloud resource usage (e.g., compute, storage, API calls).
*   A log entry from a financial transaction system.
*   The result of a data validation check where actual usage is compared against a defined budget.
*   An example of string formatting or numerical precision issues discussed within the course.

**Transcribed Code/Messages:**

```json
{
  "message": "On 2025-02 you used $2.003749139999996, exceeding $2"
}
```*

*February 15, 2025, 08:59 UTC*
it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)  
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.  
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.  
create a venv using python3 -m venv name\_of\_venv  
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location  
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.  
It even happened for me



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing this screenshot from a data science course forum, here's a breakdown of the key information, commands, and error messages:

**Key Information:**

1.  **User Context:** The user is `jaideep` on an `archlinux` machine, operating from their home directory (`~`). This immediately tells us the operating system is Arch Linux, which uses `pacman` as its package manager, and has a specific philosophy regarding system-managed Python environments.

2.  **Initial Problem:** The user attempted to install the `numpy` package using `pip3`.

3.  **Error Message - "externally-managed-environment":**
    *   This is the primary error, indicating that the `pip3` command, when run directly, is trying to install `numpy` into a system-managed Python installation.
    *   Modern Python packaging (specifically driven by PEP 668) prevents `pip` from directly modifying system-wide Python installations to avoid conflicts or breaking core system components that rely on specific Python versions or packages.

4.  **Recommended Solutions (Provided by the Error Message):**
    *   **System-wide installation (Arch Linux specific):** For system-wide Python packages, it suggests using the OS's package manager (`pacman -S python-xyz`). This is the correct Arch Linux approach for system-level dependencies.
    *   **Virtual Environments (`venv`):** For non-Arch-packaged Python packages (i.e., most data science libraries), it strongly recommends creating and using a virtual environment (`python -m venv path/to/venv`). This is the standard best practice in Python development, especially for data science, to isolate project dependencies.
    *   **`pipx` for Applications:** It also suggests `pipx` for installing Python *applications* (not libraries like numpy, but useful for tools) into isolated environments.

5.  **Warning about Overriding:** The message explicitly warns against overriding this protection (e.g., using `--break-system-packages`), stating it could "break your Python installation or OS." It also references **PEP 668**, which is the specification behind this "externally managed environment" concept.

6.  **User's Resolution:**
    *   The user successfully resolves the issue by activating an existing Python virtual environment located at `/home/jaideep/.python3`.
    *   After activating the environment, the subsequent `pip3 install numpy` command checks within that specific virtual environment.
    *   The outcome indicates that `numpy` (version 2.2.2) was *already installed* within that virtual environment, so no new installation was needed.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, and Error Messages:**

*   **Initial Command Attempt:**
    ```bash
    jaideep@archlinux ~ pip3 install numpy
    ```

*   **Error Message and Explanation:**
    ```
    error: externally-managed-environment
    √ó This environment is externally managed
    ‚ï∞‚îÄ> To install Python packages system-wide, try 'pacman -S python-xyz', where xyz is the package you are trying to
        install.

        If you wish to install a non-Arch-packaged Python package,
        create a virtual environment using 'python -m venv path/to/venv'.
        Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip.

        If you wish to install a non-Arch packaged Python application,
        it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
        virtual environment for you. Make sure you have python-pipx
        installed via pacman.
    note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-sy
    hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
    ```
    *(Note: `--break-sy` is cut off but implies `--break-system-packages`.)*

*   **User's First Resolution Command (Activate Virtual Environment):**
    ```bash
    jaideep@archlinux ~ source /home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate
    ```

*   **User's Second Command Attempt (Re-attempt `pip3 install numpy`):**
    ```bash
    jaideep@archlinux ~ pip3 install numpy
    ```

*   **Success Message:**
    ```
    Requirement already satisfied: numpy in ./.python3/lib/python3.13/site-packages (2.2.2)
    ```*

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a common operation in Large Language Model (LLM) applications: generating text embeddings. The user is interacting with a command-line interface (bash shell) to send a request to an embeddings API, likely as part of a data science course project focused on LLMs.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment Setup:** The user first sets an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. This token is a sensitive authentication credential (likely a JWT) required to access the proxy API. Its presence indicates that the proxy requires authentication.
2.  **API Call:** A `curl` command is used to make a `POST` request to an embeddings endpoint.
    *   **Endpoint:** `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This URL suggests a custom proxy (`aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev`) is being used to access an OpenAI-compatible embeddings API.
    *   **Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json` is correctly set, indicating the request body is in JSON format.
    *   **Request Body (`-d` flag):** The JSON payload specifies:
        *   `"model": "text-embedding-3-small"`: This is a specific, widely used embedding model provided by OpenAI, known for its small size and efficiency.
        *   `"input": ["king", "queen"]`: The actual text strings for which embeddings are requested.
3.  **API Response (Partial):** The `curl` command successfully executes and receives a JSON response.
    *   The `curl` progress shows a successful transfer (100% received/uploaded, 3 seconds total time).
    *   The JSON response begins with:
        *   `"object": "list"`: Indicates the top-level structure is a list of results.
        *   `"data": [`: Contains the array of embedding objects.
        *   `"object": "embedding"`: Confirms the type of object within the data array.
        *   `"index": 0`: Specifies that this embedding corresponds to the first input string ("king").
        *   `"embedding": [...]`: This is the actual numerical vector (a list of floating-point numbers) representing the embedding of the word "king". The screenshot cuts off before showing the full vector or the embedding for "queen".

**Context:**

*   The user's prompt `Nelson TDS-Project-1-LLM` suggests a project named "TDS-Project-1-LLM", likely part of a course on The Data Science (TDS) or a similar curriculum focusing on Large Language Models (LLM).
*   This is a typical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLM-based applications, where text is converted into numerical representations (embeddings) for tasks like semantic search, similarity comparisons, or as input for other machine learning models.

In PowerShell  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The user is operating within a **PowerShell 7 (x64)** terminal on a Windows system. The current working directory is `C:\Users\Nelson`.
2.  **Action Attempted:** The user is attempting to make an API call using the `curl` command-line tool.
    *   **Method:** It's an HTTP `POST` request.
    *   **Target Endpoint:** `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This URL suggests an OpenAI compatible embedding API endpoint, potentially routed through a custom proxy or worker service (`sanand.workers.dev`).
    *   **Headers:**
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`: Indicates the request body is JSON.
        *   `Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN`: An authentication header is being sent with a Bearer token. The token itself is represented by a placeholder environment variable `$AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
    *   **Request Body (Data):** The JSON payload specifies an embedding model and input text:
        *   `"model": "text-embedding-3-small"`: Requests embeddings using a specific OpenAI model.
        *   `"input": ["king", "queen"]`: The strings for which embeddings are to be generated.
3.  **Command Execution Behavior:** After entering the `curl` command, PowerShell displayed `>>` prompts, indicating that it expected more input. This often happens in PowerShell when a single quote is opened but not closed, or when `$` is used for a variable that is not defined, or when parsing special characters in the command line (like the JSON payload with its internal quotes). The user then pressed Enter twice, resulting in `>>` and `>> '`, before the command finally seemed to execute or fail its parsing. This suggests the initial `curl` command might not have been fully or correctly interpreted by PowerShell before `curl` itself ran.
4.  **Error Message:** The API call returned a JSON formatted error response.
    *   **Message:** `"Missing Authorization: Bearer header."`
    *   **Reference:** The error message directs the user to a GitHub repository: `https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy`.

**Analysis of the Error:**

Despite including an `Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN` header in the `curl` command, the server responded with "Missing Authorization: Bearer header." This strongly implies one of the following:

*   **`$AIPROXY_TOKEN` Variable Not Set:** The most probable cause is that the environment variable `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` was not defined or was empty when the command was executed in PowerShell. PowerShell would then substitute an empty string (or nothing) for the variable, effectively sending an `Authorization: Bearer ` header with no token, or an incomplete header which the server interprets as missing.
*   **PowerShell Quoting/Parsing Issue:** The multi-line input (`>>`) suggests PowerShell had trouble parsing the command, particularly the JSON data within single quotes. If the command was not correctly formed or escaped for PowerShell, `curl` might not have received the `Authorization` header correctly.
*   **Invalid/Expired Token:** If the variable was set, the value it contained might be an invalid or expired token according to the `aiproxy` service.
*   **Proxy-Specific Requirement:** The `aiproxy` service might have specific authentication requirements not met by the token provided (e.g., expecting a different format or specific content, or the token is for the wrong service).

The presence of the `sanand0/aiproxy` GitHub link in the error message is a strong hint that the user should consult that repository's documentation for correct setup and usage of the proxy, especially regarding API key/token configuration.

### Post #412 by **Kabir Vyas** (ds-students)
*February 15, 2025, 13:45 UTC*
My data is getting generated -  



> **Image Content:** *As an expert analyzing screenshots from a data science course forum, here's a breakdown of the key information from this image:

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** The user is interacting with a web application or API running locally on their machine, indicated by the `127.0.0.1:8000` address. This is a common setup for development and course exercises (e.g., using Flask, Django, or a custom Python script with a web interface).
2.  **API Endpoint/Task Execution:**
    *   The URL `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv` suggests that a specific task named "Install uv" (where `uv` is likely a reference to a tool like `uv` Python package installer) was requested or is in progress.
    *   The `run` endpoint implies the execution of a background process or script.
3.  **Server Response Format:** The server is responding with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) payload, which is a standard format for API responses.
4.  **Operation Status:** The `message` field in the JSON, `"Data generation complete"`, explicitly states that a data generation process has successfully finished. This is highly relevant for a data science context, indicating a step where synthetic data, datasets, or database content might have been created.
5.  **Generated/Affected Files:** The `files` array lists several files and directories that are likely outputs or part of the "Data generation" process. These include various data formats and common project structure elements:
    *   **Text Data:** `comments.txt`, `dates.txt`, `email.txt`, `ticket-sales-gold.txt`
    *   **Structured Data:** `contacts.json`
    *   **Database:** `ticket-sales.db` (commonly SQLite for local development)
    *   **Image/Binary:** `credit_card.png` (This is interesting for a data science course; it could be dummy data for an image processing task, or perhaps a demonstration of handling sensitive information/PII).
    *   **Documentation/Other:** `format.md`
    *   **Directories:** `docs`, `logs` (standard for project organization and debugging)
6.  **Browser Interface:** The "Pretty-print" checkbox indicates that the browser (or an extension) is rendering the raw JSON output and provides an option to format it for better readability.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   **Browser Tab Title (partially visible):** `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install uv`
*   **Address Bar URL:** `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv`
*   **Visible Label:** `Pretty-print`
*   **JSON Content:**
    ```json
    {
      "files": [
        "comments.txt",
        "contacts.json",
        "credit_card.png",
        "dates.txt",
        "docs",
        "email.txt",
        "format.md",
        "logs",

        "ticket-sales.db"
      ],
      "message": "Data generation complete"
    }
    ```*



  
despite this I am getting an error when evaluating the file with no explanation of the error. Can someone please help with this.  
Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a code editor, likely VS Code, showcasing an open Markdown file named `format.md` within a `data` directory. The primary focus appears to be on demonstrating or addressing issues related to Markdown formatting, including text and embedded code.

**Key Information:**

1.  **File Context:** The active file is `format.md`, located in a `data` directory (`data > format.md`). Other open files are `.env`, `app.py`, and `evaluate.py`, suggesting a Python development environment relevant to data science (e.g., a data science project with environment variables, application logic, and evaluation scripts).
2.  **Markdown Content - Formatting Issues:**
    *   The heading `#Unformatted Markdown` on line 1 explicitly states the file's nature.
    *   A paragraph on line 3, `This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.`, further highlights intentional formatting problems (extra spaces, trailing whitespace).
    *   An unordered list (lines 4-7) uses inconsistent markers (`-`, `+`, `*`), which is valid Markdown but often considered unformatted for consistency.
3.  **Embedded Code Block:** The Markdown file includes a fenced code block for Python, indicated by ` ```py` on line 9 and ` ``` ` on line 12.
4.  **Python Code:** Inside the code block, there's a simple Python `print` statement.
5.  **Purpose:** Given the explicit mentions of "Unformatted Markdown," "extra spaces and trailing whitespace," and inconsistent list markers, this file is likely used in a data science course to teach or demonstrate:
    *   Markdown syntax.
    *   Best practices for consistent formatting.
    *   The use of linters or formatters (e.g., Black for Python, Prettier for Markdown) to clean up code and documentation.
    *   How to embed code snippets in documentation.

**Transcription of Code/Commands/Text:**

The following is transcribed exactly as it appears in the screenshot:

```
data > format.md
1  #Unformatted Markdown
2
3  This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.
4  - First item
5  - Second item
6  +Third item
7  * Fourth item
8
9   ```py
10  print("user@example.com")
11
12   ```
```*



  
Even the markdown file shows the correct email. What are the possible issues that I could be facing with this one.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

1. in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
2. When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

facing the issue on submission  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a section of an online submission form, likely for a data science course, requesting project-related links and image names. The form uses input validation, indicated by the "Must match pattern" error.

### Key Information:

*   **Context:** The form is collecting submission details for "Project 1," specifically a GitHub repository link and a DockerHub image name.
*   **GitHub Repository Link:**
    *   **Question:** Asks for the link to the GitHub repository containing the code for Project 1.
    *   **Expected Format:** `https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`
    *   **User Input Status:** The user has entered a link that appears to conform to the expected format, and no error is shown for this field.
*   **DockerHub Image Name:**
    *   **Question:** Asks for the name of the image published on DockerHub.
    *   **Expected Format:** `user-name/image-name`
    *   **User Input Status:** The user has entered a value that, while following the general `user-name/image-name` structure, triggers a validation error.
    *   **Error Encountered:** A "Must match pattern" error is displayed beneath the DockerHub image name input field. This indicates that the entered value `rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25` does not satisfy a more specific, underlying regular expression or naming convention requirement, even though it broadly fits the example. Common reasons for such an error in Docker image names include disallowed characters (e.g., uppercase letters in the image name itself if not permitted, or specific date formats like "Jan25" if not expected as part of the image name, but rather as a tag).

### Transcribed Elements:

**Form Fields and Prompts:**

*   **Question 1 Title:** `What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1? *`
*   **Question 1 Format Example:** `It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`
*   **Question 2 Title:** `What is the name of the image published on DockerHub? *`
*   **Question 2 Format Example:** `It should look like user-name/image-name`

**User Inputs:**

*   **GitHub Repository Link Input:** `https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Ja` (note: the input is truncated, so the full text is not visible)
*   **DockerHub Image Name Input:** `rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25`

**Error Messages:**

*   **DockerHub Image Name Error:** `Must match pattern` (accompanied by a red exclamation mark icon)*

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python traceback, indicating an error encountered when trying to initialize the OpenAI client.

### Key Information:

*   **Error Type:** `openai.OpenAIError`
*   **Origin of Error (User Code):** The error occurs in the user's script, `/app/app.py`, on line 35, specifically during the instantiation of the `OpenAI` client object: `client = OpenAI(`.
*   **Root Cause:** The `openai` library explicitly states that the API key is missing.
*   **Suggested Solutions:** The error message provides two clear ways to resolve the issue:
    1.  Pass the `api_key` directly as an argument when initializing the `OpenAI` client (e.g., `client = OpenAI(api_key="your_api_key_here")`).
    2.  Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   **Internal Call Stack:** The error is raised within the `openai` library itself, specifically in the `__init__` method of the `_client.py` file (line 110), after detecting the missing API key.
*   **Python Version:** The traceback path indicates Python 3.12 is being used (`python3.12/site-packages`).

### Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

```
File "/app/app.py", line 35, in <module>
client = OpenAI(
^^^^^^^
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/openai/_client.py", line 110, in __init__

Blunder in your `main.py`.

What we expect in project.

1. server running inside docker container at 8000.
2. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

> **Image Content:** *Here's an expert analysis of the screenshot, detailing the key information and transcribing the relevant parts:

**Key Information:**

The user is attempting to build a Docker image named `pratik007thala/automation-agent` from a Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).

1.  **Successful Docker Login:** The session begins with a successful `docker login`, indicating that authentication to Docker Hub is not the issue.
2.  **Docker Build Command:** The user executes `docker build -t pratik007thala/automation-agent .`.
3.  **Dockerfile Content:** The Dockerfile (at least the first line) specifies `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`, indicating that the build process requires downloading this base image.
4.  **Build Failure Point:** The build fails at the step of "loading metadata" for the `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` image.
5.  **Root Cause - DNS Resolution Failure:** The core error message clearly states `"dial tcp: lookup docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com: no such host"`. This means the system where Docker is running cannot resolve the hostname of the Cloudflare storage server (which hosts Docker image layers) to an IP address. This points to a network configuration issue, specifically with DNS resolution, on the user's machine or network.
6.  **Proxy Check:** An additional diagnostic message "static system has no HTTP/TPS proxy: connecting to docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com: no such host" indicates that Docker attempted a direct connection and found no configured proxy, confirming the DNS lookup failure as the primary problem, not a proxy blocking the connection.

    *   The top-level project is named `TDS-Project-1`.
    *   It contains a nested directory also named `tds-project-1` (lowercase), suggesting a main module or sub-project.
    *   Inside `tds-project-1`, there's an `app` directory, which likely holds the core application logic.
    *   Standard Python cache directories (`__pycache__`) are present at multiple levels, indicating Python bytecode compilation.
    *   A `.venv` directory exists at the root, which is typical for a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

2.  **Files and Their Purpose (Inferred):**
    *   **Python Scripts (`.py` files):**
        *   `__init__.py`: Indicates the `app` directory is a Python package.
        *   `funtion_tasks.py`: (Note: "funtion" appears to be a typo for "function") likely contains helper functions or task definitions.
        *   `main.py`: The primary entry point for the application.
        *   `datagen.py`: A script responsible for generating data.
        *   `evaluate.py`: A script likely used for evaluating a model or the project's performance.
    *   **Data Files:**
        *   `data` (directory): Currently highlighted, suggesting it's selected. This directory would typically store input or output data.
        *   `task_to_embed.txt`: A text file, potentially containing text or data to be processed for embedding (e.g., in an NLP context).
    *   **Project Configuration/Metadata Files:**
        *   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git version control.
        *   `Dockerfile`: Defines how to build a Docker image for the project, indicating containerization is used.
        *   `README.md`: Provides general information and documentation for the project. (Appears twice in the listing, which could be a visual glitch or a file at the root and another within a collapsed sub-directory, but given the flat listing, it's more likely a duplicate display of the root README).
        *   `LICENSE`: Contains the licensing information for the project.

3.  **Git Status/Indicators:**
    *   `datagen.py` shows `2, U`: This indicates that the file `datagen.py` has **2 uncommitted changes** (lines modified, added, or deleted). 'U' typically stands for "Untracked" or "Unstaged/Uncommitted changes". In this context, with a number preceding it, it means modified but not yet committed.
    *   `evaluate.py` shows `3, U`: Similar to `datagen.py`, this file has **3 uncommitted changes**.
    *   The yellow/orange dots next to `TDS-Project-1` and `tds-project-1` (lowercase) often signify uncommitted changes within those directories or that they are currently active.
    *   The green dots (e.g., next to `app`, `__pycache__`, `data`) generally mean that the contents within those directories are either unchanged from the last commit or are newly added and staged.

4.  **Current Selection:**
    *   The `data` directory inside the `app` folder is currently highlighted, indicating it's the active selection in the file explorer.

**Exact Transcription of Files/Folders and Any Commands/Errors:**

No don‚Äôt do that, just follow the procedure.  
Two problems with keeping token in file.

1. It will become public after you push to github.
2. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the "Response" tab of an API client or network debugging tool, showing a JSON-formatted error message.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Tool/Context:** The interface suggests a tool used for making API requests, such as Postman, Insomnia, or a browser's developer console (network tab). The "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs" tabs are typical of such environments.
2.  **Request Status:** The core issue is an authentication failure, indicated by:
    *   `Error code: 401`: This is an HTTP status code for "Unauthorized," meaning the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
    *   `message: 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.'`: This provides the specific reason for the 401 error. It indicates that the authentication token provided in the request was not issued by a trusted or recognized authority/source by the API server.
3.  **Error Details:**
    *   `type: 'invalid_request_error'`: Categorizes the error as a problem with the request itself.
    *   `param: None`: Indicates that no specific parameter within the request (other than the token itself) caused this error.
    *   `code: 'invalid_issuer'`: A specific internal error code confirming the issue with the token's origin.

**In summary:** The user attempted to make an API request but failed to authenticate because the provided authentication token was not recognized as coming from a legitimate or expected source. They need to verify that they are using the correct token, obtained from the correct service/provider, and that it is still valid and not expired.

---

### Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}"
}
```*

Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

the error that comes is :

## Dockerfile:2

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn‚Äôt work.  
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.

Aagman

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can‚Äôt understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.  
When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.

```
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh

Here‚Äôs how to prompt folks. Just do what [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) mentioned in today‚Äôs live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

[x.com](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1890492955842007087?s=46&t=U3mfkIFH433B6kVe5ZktSw)

**Key Information:**

*   The image depicts a **male individual** with dark hair, a beard, and glasses, smiling directly at the camera.
*   The background appears to be an **out-of-focus urban setting** with buildings.
*   As this is solely a profile picture, it **does not contain any information related to forum content**, such as posts, discussions, specific data science topics, or any technical details. Its purpose is to visually represent a user.

**Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

Most people are still prompting wrong.
I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.
Here‚Äôs how it works: [pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1890492955842007087/photo/1)



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot from a data science course forum presents an expertly structured example of a "prompt" ‚Äî likely for a large language model (LLM) or similar AI system ‚Äî illustrating its key components. The overall title "The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt" suggests a foundational lesson on crafting effective prompts.

The image clearly dissects a user's request for hike recommendations into four distinct categories: Goal, Return Format, Warnings, and Context Dump. This structure is crucial for guiding an AI to provide accurate, relevant, and well-formatted responses.

---

**Key Information and Analysis:**

The image displays a prompt designed to elicit specific information about hiking recommendations, broken down into logical sections to improve clarity and guide the AI's response.

1.  **Title:**
    *   **Text:** "The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt"
    *   **Analysis:** This title indicates the purpose of the visual: to break down the components of a well-formed prompt. "o1" might refer to a specific type of prompt (e.g., "Order 1," simple/direct, or a course-specific designation).

2.  **The Prompt Content (Full Transcription):**
    The central grey box contains the full text of the prompt, which is then categorized by the colored bars on the right.

    ```
    I want a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San
    Francisco.

    Each hike should provide a cool and unique adventure, and be lesser
    known.

    For each hike, return the name of the hike as I'd find it on AllTrails,
    then provide the starting address of the hike, the ending address of
    the hike, distance, drive time, hike duration, and what makes it a cool
    and unique adventure.

    Return the top 3.

    Be careful to make sure that the name of trail is correct, that it
    actually exists, and that the time is correct.

    --

    For context: my girlfriend and i hike a ton! we've done pretty much
    all of the local SF hikes, whether that's presidio or golden gate park.
    we definitely want to get out of town -- we did mount tam pretty
    recently, the whole thing from the beginning of the stairs to stinson -
    - it was really long and we are definitely in the mood for something
    different this weekend! ocean views would still be nice. we love
    delicious food. one thing i loved about the mt tam hike is that it ends
    with a celebration (Arriving in town to breakfast!) The old missile
    silos and stuff near Discovery point is cool but i've just done that
    hike probably 20x at this point. We won't be seeing eachother for a
    few weeks (she has to stay in LA for work) so the uniqueness here
    really counts.
    ```

3.  **Categorized Sections:**

    *   **Goal (Green Bar):**
        *   **Description:** Defines the primary objective of the prompt ‚Äì what the user ultimately wants.
        *   **Transcribed Text:**
            ```

            known.
            ```

    *   **Return Format (Blue Bar):**
        *   **Description:** Specifies the structure, content, and quantity of the desired output for each item. This tells the AI exactly what information to extract and how to present it.
        *   **Transcribed Text:**

            For context: my girlfriend and i hike a ton! we've done pretty much
            all of the local SF hikes, whether that's presidio or golden gate park.
            we definitely want to get out of town -- we did mount tam pretty
            recently, the whole thing from the beginning of the stairs to stinson -
            - it was really long and we are definitely in the mood for something
            different this weekend! ocean views would still be nice. we love
            delicious food. one thing i loved about the mt tam hike is that it ends
            with a celebration (Arriving in town to breakfast!) The old missile
            silos and stuff near Discovery point is cool but i've just done that
            hike probably 20x at this point. We won't be seeing eachother for a
            few weeks (she has to stay in LA for work) so the uniqueness here
            really counts.
            ```

**Summary and Implications for Data Science/AI:**

This image serves as an excellent pedagogical tool for understanding prompt engineering. It demonstrates that effective prompts go beyond simply stating a request. They require:

1.  **Clear Objectives:** What needs to be achieved (Goal).
2.  **Structured Output:** How the information should be presented (Return Format).
3.  **Guiding Constraints/Safeguards:** Instructions to avoid common errors or biases (Warnings).
4.  **Rich Context:** Background information that allows the AI to generate more nuanced, personalized, and relevant responses, mimicking human understanding (Context Dump).

By segmenting the prompt in this manner, users can systematically build complex requests, making it easier for an AI model to interpret and fulfill the requirements accurately. This approach is highly valuable in data science applications involving natural language processing and generative AI, where the quality of the prompt directly impacts the quality of the output.

**No traditional code, commands, or error messages are present in this image.** The "commands" are embedded within the natural language prompt itself, designed for an AI to interpret.*

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.  
But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail‚Ä¶

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

Kind regards

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot captures a browser window displaying the successful execution of a command via a local web server, likely as part of a data science course or lab environment.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Local Web Server:** The URL `127.0.0.1:8000` indicates that a web server is running locally on the user's machine, listening on port 8000. This is a common setup for development environments, interactive labs, or tools that provide a web interface for executing tasks.
2.  **Task Execution via URL Parameters:** The browser's address bar contains a long URL with query parameters that instruct the local server to perform specific actions.
    *   `?task=Install%20uv%20(if%20required)%20and%20run%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`
    *   Decoding the URL-encoded spaces (`%20`):
        `task=Install uv (if required) and run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`
    *   This indicates a multi-step task:
        *   It first attempts to "Install uv (if required)". `uv` is a fast Python package installer and resolver, suggesting the environment might be setting up dependencies.
        *   Subsequently, it instructs the server to "run" a Python script directly from a GitHub raw content URL.
3.  **Python Script Source:** The script being run is `datagen.py`, located at: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`. This URL points to a public GitHub repository named `tools-in-data-science-public`, likely for a course or project designated `tds-2025-01` (possibly a specific cohort or module) and within `project-1`.
4.  **Successful Execution Confirmation (JSON Output):** The body of the page displays a JSON response, indicating the outcome of the executed task.
    *   The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the output is formatted for readability.
    *   The JSON object contains a single key-value pair: `"success"`.
    *   The value of `"success"` confirms that the specified `datagen.py` script was executed.
    *   **Crucially**, it also indicates that the script was run *with an argument*: `with email trial@gmail.com`. This implies the `datagen.py` script requires an email address as input, likely for user identification, data generation, or submission purposes within the course context.

**Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (Exact Appearance):**

**Browser Address Bar URL (decoded for clarity):**
`127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install uv (if required) and run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`
*(Note: The actual URL in the browser shows URL-encoded characters like `%20` for spaces.)*

**JSON Output:**
```json
{
"success": "Executed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py with email trial@gmail.com"
}
```*



Im able to execute the query succesfully.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Windows File Explorer window, providing insights into a user's data organization and potential projects within a data science context.

### Key Information:

1.  **Current Directory:** The user is currently navigating within a folder named `data`.
    *   **Full Path:** `This PC > Acer (C:) > data`
    *   This indicates the `data` folder is located directly on the C: drive of an Acer computer. This is a common location for project data, often at the root level of a drive or within a user's profile.

2.  **Contents of the `data` Folder:** The folder contains a mix of files and subfolders, many of which are highly relevant to data science workflows:
    *   **Folders:**
        *   `docs` (File folder) - Likely for documentation, project descriptions, or reports.
        *   `logs` (File folder) - Could contain application logs, data processing logs, or system logs.
    *   **Data Files:**
        *   `comments` (Text Source File, 10 KB) - Could be raw text data, user comments for sentiment analysis, or textual feedback.
        *   `contacts` (JSON Source File, 9 KB) - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for structured and semi-structured data, common in web APIs and data exchange.
        *   `credit_card` (PNG File, 5 KB) - A PNG image file. This could be a visual representation of credit card data, an image of a credit card itself (perhaps for OCR tasks), or a diagram related to a project.
        *   `dates` (Text Source File, 15 KB) - Likely a file containing date-related information, potentially for time-series analysis or event logging.
        *   `email` (Text Source File, 1 KB) - Could be email content for natural language processing (NLP) tasks or contact information.
        *   `format` (Markdown Source File, 1 KB) - Markdown is often used for writing documentation, README files, or simple reports, indicating project instructions or data formatting guidelines.
        *   `ticket-sales` (Data Base File, 32 KB) - A "Data Base File" typically indicates structured data, possibly from a local database system (e.g., SQLite database, or a generic database file type). This strongly suggests a dataset related to sales transactions.

3.  **Modification Timestamps:** All listed files and folders were modified on **16-02-2025** at either **11:56** or **11:58**. This suggests they were all created, downloaded, or updated around the same time, possibly as part of a single operation like unzipping an archive, running a data collection script, or setting up a new project. The future date (February 2025) might indicate a system clock set ahead or that this screenshot was taken from a simulated environment for demonstration.

4.  **User Environment & Course Context Clues (from Quick Access Pane):**
    *   **`TDS assignments 4` (File folder):** This entry in the quick access sidebar strongly suggests the user is a student in a data science course, likely named "The Data Science" or "Technical Data Science," and this folder is related to their fourth set of assignments. This confirms the "data science course forum" context of the image.
    *   **`llm-automation-agent` (File folder):** This folder name indicates work related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation, which is an advanced and current topic in data science and AI.

### Summary for a Data Science Course Forum:

This screenshot shows a well-organized `data` directory containing various file types commonly encountered in data science projects, including text files, JSON, database files, and a markdown file for documentation. The presence of folders like `TDS assignments 4` and `llm-automation-agent` in the quick access pane strongly indicates that the user is a student actively engaged in a data science curriculum, potentially working on a project involving sales data analysis, contact management, text processing, or even LLM-related automation. The recent and uniform modification timestamps suggest a freshly prepared or recently updated dataset/project environment.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

*   There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages visible in the screenshot.*



But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder  
The datagen.py file is in the project folder itself.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python code snippet commonly used in data science projects for setting up file paths and ensuring necessary directories exist.

**Key Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The code defines a standard way to locate the project's root directory and then creates a dedicated `data` subdirectory within it. This ensures that all data files are accessed from a consistent location, which is crucial for project organization, reproducibility, and portability across different environments.
*   **Language & Libraries:** The code is written in Python and heavily utilizes the built-in `os` module, specifically `os.path` for path manipulation and `os.makedirs` for directory creation.
*   **Path Definition:**
    *   `PROJECT_ROOT`: This variable is set to the absolute path of the current working directory where the script is being executed. This establishes the base for all other relative paths within the project.
    *   `DATA_DIR`: This variable constructs the path to a `data` folder located directly inside the `PROJECT_ROOT`. `os.path.join` is used to ensure OS-agnostic path construction (e.g., using `\` on Windows, `/` on Linux/macOS).
*   **Directory Creation:** The `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)` command is used to create the `data` directory. The `exist_ok=True` argument is important: if the directory already exists, the command will not raise an error, making the script robust and idempotent.
*   **Comments:** Descriptive comments explain the purpose of the code sections, indicating good programming practice.
*   **No Errors:** There are no error messages visible in the screenshot, suggesting the code snippet itself is syntactically correct and likely executes without immediate issues.

**Code and Commands (Transcribed Exactly):**

```python
35 # Ensure all files are accessed from the 'data' folder inside the project root
36 PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
37 DATA_DIR = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "data")
38 
39 # Ensure the 'data' directory exists
40 os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)
```*



am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.

*February 16, 2025, 06:51 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Python function `run_datagen` designed to automate the process of downloading a Python script, ensuring a dependency is met, and then executing the downloaded script with a specific email address.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Function Purpose:** The `run_datagen` function takes a `task_description` string as input. Its primary goal is to extract a Python script URL and an email address from this description, download the script, verify/install the `uv` tool, and then run the downloaded script with the extracted email.
2.  **Input Parsing:** It uses regular expressions to parse the `task_description` for a Python script URL (starting with `http://` or `https://` and ending with `.py`) and a standard email address format.
3.  **Error Handling (Input):** If either the URL or the email cannot be found in the `task_description`, the function immediately returns an error dictionary.
4.  **Script Download:** It uses the `requests` library to download the script from the extracted URL. It saves the script to a file named "datagen.py" within a directory specified by `PROJECT_ROOT`. It checks the HTTP status to ensure a successful download.
5.  **Dependency Check/Installation:** It attempts to run `uv --version`. If `uv` (likely a Python packaging tool like pip-tools or an alternative installer) is not found (raises `FileNotFoundError`), it proceeds to install it using `pip install uv`.
6.  **Script Execution:** Finally, it executes the downloaded "datagen.py" script using the `python` interpreter, passing the extracted email address as a command-line argument. The script is run with `PROJECT_ROOT` as the current working directory.
7.  **Success Output:** Upon successful execution, it returns a dictionary indicating success and confirming which script was executed with which email.

**Transcribed Code:**

```python
def run_datagen(task_description):

    # Extract URL and email from task description
    script_url_match = re.search(r"https?://[^\s]+\.py", task_description)
    user_email_match = re.search(r"[a-zA-Z0-9_%\-+.]+@[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", task_description)

    if not script_url_match or not user_email_match:
        return {"error": "URL or email not found in the prompt."}

    script_url = script_url_match.group(0)
    user_email = user_email_match.group(0)

    script_path = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "datagen.py")

    try:
        # Download script
        response = requests.get(script_url)
        response.raise_for_status() # Ensure download was successful
        with open(script_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)

        # Check if UV is installed
        try:
            subprocess.run(["uv", "--version"], check=True, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "uv"], check=True) # Install UV if not found

        # Run the script with user email
        subprocess.run(["python", script_path, user_email], cwd=PROJECT_ROOT, check=True)

        return {"success": f"Executed {script_url} with email {user_email}"}
```

**Commands Executed via `subprocess.run`:**

1.  `uv --version` (to check if `uv` is installed)
    *   As seen in code: `["uv", "--version"]`
2.  `pip install uv` (to install `uv` if not found)
    *   As seen in code: `["pip", "install", "uv"]`
3.  `python <script_path> <user_email>` (to run the downloaded script)
    *   As seen in code: `["python", script_path, user_email]`

**Error Messages:**

1.  `"URL or email not found in the prompt."` (returned by the function if regex matches fail)*



  
I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a log of two HTTP requests and their responses, likely from a web server or an application's console within a data science course environment. The logs indicate attempts to interact with an API that appears to handle database queries and file operations based on natural language commands.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Overall Context:**
The user is interacting with a local server (`127.0.0.1`) running on two different ports (`51794` and `51797`). They are attempting to execute a data science task involving a SQLite database and then retrieve the results from a file. Both attempts resulted in errors.

---

**Detailed Analysis of Each Log Entry:**

**1. First Request (POST - Task Execution):**

*   **Log Type:** `INFO`
*   **Source/Timestamp:** `127.0.0.1:51794` (Localhost on port 51794)
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint and Parameters:** `/run?task=...`
    *   The `task` parameter contains a URL-encoded string representing a natural language instruction.
    *   **Transcribed (URL-encoded):**
        `POST /run?task=The+SQLite+database+file+%60data%2Fticket-sales.db%60+has+a+%60tickets%60+with+columns+%60type%60%2C+%60units%60%2C+and+%60price%60.+Each+row+is+a+customer+bid+for+a+concert+ticket.+What+is+the+total+sales+of+all+the+items+in+the+%22Gold%22+ticket+type%3F+Write+the+number+in+%60data%2Fticket-sales-gold.txt%60 HTTP/1.1`
    *   **Decoded `task` parameter:**
        `The SQLite database file `data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write the number in `data/ticket-sales-gold.txt``

*   **HTTP Protocol:** `HTTP/1.1`
*   **Response Code & Message:** `400 Bad Request`

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The user is sending a "natural language query" as a `task` to the `/run` endpoint. This suggests an application that can interpret natural language into database operations (e.g., an LLM-powered agent or a specialized query parser).
    *   The task explicitly asks to:
        *   Interact with a SQLite database file: `data/ticket-sales.db`.
        *   Query a table named: `tickets`.
        *   The table has columns: `type`, `units`, `price`.
        *   The goal is to calculate the "total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type." This implies a SQL query like `SELECT SUM(units * price) FROM tickets WHERE type = 'Gold';`.
        *   The instruction also includes an output directive: "Write the number in `data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`".
    *   The `400 Bad Request` status indicates that the server could not understand or process the request due to a client-side error. This could be due to:
        *   Malformed URL encoding (though it appears correct here).
        *   The natural language instruction being ambiguous, malformed, or containing an unsupported command for the `/run` endpoint's interpreter.
        *   Permissions issues or an inability for the server to write to the specified file path (`data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`).
        *   An internal error in the server's task processing logic.

---

**2. Second Request (GET - File Retrieval):**

*   **Log Type:** `INFO`
*   **Source/Timestamp:** `127.0.0.1:51797` (Localhost on port 51797)
*   **HTTP Method:** `GET`
*   **Endpoint and Parameters:** `/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`
    *   The `path` parameter specifies the file to be read.
    *   **Transcribed (URL-encoded):**
        `GET /read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt HTTP/1.1`
    *   **Decoded `path` parameter:**
        `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`

*   **HTTP Protocol:** `HTTP/1.1`
*   **Response Code & Message:** `404 Not Found`

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The user is attempting to retrieve the file `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`, which was the designated output file for the previous `POST` request.
    *   The `404 Not Found` status indicates that the requested resource (the file) does not exist on the server.
    *   This `404` error is a **consequence** of the `400 Bad Request` from the first request. Since the first request failed to execute the task and write the result, the `data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` file was never created, leading to the "Not Found" error when trying to read it.

---

**Key Takeaways for a Data Science Course Forum:**

*   **API Interaction:** The student is learning how to interact with a custom API using HTTP requests (POST for computation, GET for retrieval).
*   **Natural Language Processing/SQL Generation:** The `POST` request's `task` parameter indicates an attempt to use natural language to generate or execute a database query, which is a common pattern in modern data science tools (e.g., integrating with LLMs).
*   **Error Handling:** The student is encountering common HTTP errors (`400`, `404`), and needs to understand their meaning.
*   **Debugging Pathway:** The primary issue is the `400 Bad Request` on the `POST` call. The subsequent `404` is a secondary issue directly caused by the first failure. The student should focus on:
    1.  Verifying the syntax or content of their natural language prompt for the `/run` endpoint.
    2.  Checking if the server's task processing component is configured correctly or has all necessary dependencies (e.g., database file existence, write permissions).
    3.  Understanding how the server is supposed to interpret the "Write the number in..." instruction.*

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/` directory inside your project instead of C: drive

```
["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which doesn‚Äôt exist in your system. I‚Äôll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

```
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

```

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn‚Äôt include the `"data"` key.

### What I‚Äôve Tried

1. **Token Verification:**

* I‚Äôm using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.
* The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

```
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"

```

* I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

2. **API Request Details:**

* The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* The payload is set as:

json

Copy

```
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}

```

* Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

3. **Debug Output:**  
   Here‚Äôs a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

```
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
üî¥ A9 failed: 'data'

```

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.

### What I Suspect

* The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
* There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I‚Äôm not aware of.
* Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

### Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1). But this gave me the following error:

```
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

```

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I‚Äôm not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user's current usage and spending for **Codespaces**, a cloud-based development environment (likely GitHub Codespaces, given the common interface). The information is presented in a dark theme, typical of developer dashboards.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

1.  **Codespaces Overview:**
    *   The top section indicates "Codespaces" with an icon resembling angle brackets (`<>`), commonly used for code.
    *   It states that "Included quotas reset in 10 days," implying a free tier or a recurring allowance that refreshes monthly.
    *   A clickable link "See billing documentation" is provided for more details.

2.  **Usage Hours:**
    *   **Current Usage:** The user has consumed "172.37 of 180.00 included core hours used."
    *   **Visual Indicator:** A prominent red progress bar shows that the user is very close to reaching their included quota for core hours (approximately 95.76% used).
    *   **Cost:** The cost for these usage hours is currently "$0.00", indicating they are within their free allowance.

3.  **Storage:**
    *   **Current Usage:** The user has utilized "9.21 of 20.00 included GB-month used" for storage.
    *   **Visual Indicator:** A blue progress bar indicates moderate storage usage (approximately 46.05% used).
    *   **Cost:** The cost for storage is currently "$0.00", also within the free allowance.

4.  **Monthly Spending Limit:**
    *   The total monthly spending limit is currently set at "$0.00".
    *   A link "Set up a spending limit" is available, suggesting the user can configure a custom limit to avoid unexpected charges once the included quotas are exceeded.
    *   The overall current cost shown at the bottom right is also "$0.00", confirming no charges have been incurred yet.

In summary, the user is nearing their free quota for Codespaces usage hours but has ample storage remaining within their included limits, with no charges incurred so far.

---

**Exact Transcriptions:**

*   **Header Title:** Codespaces
*   **Header Information:** Included quotas reset in 10 days. See billing documentation
*   **Usage Hours Label:** Usage hours
*   **Usage Hours Value:** 172.37 of 180.00 included core hours used
*   **Usage Hours Cost:** $0.00
*   **Storage Label:** Storage
*   **Storage Value:** 9.21 of 20.00 included GB-month used
*   **Storage Cost:** $0.00
*   **Spending Limit Information:** $0.00 monthly spending limit | Set up a spending limit
*   **Total Current Cost:** $0.00*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a user's resource usage dashboard for **GitHub Codespaces**. It provides a clear overview of their consumption against included quotas for the current billing period.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Platform/Service:** The top section clearly identifies the service as "Codespaces," which is GitHub's cloud-based development environment.
2.  **Quota Reset Information:** The user is informed that their "Included quotas reset in 13 days," indicating a monthly or periodic refresh of their free or included resource limits. There's also a clickable link to "See billing documentation" for more details on pricing and usage.
3.  **Resource Usage - Usage Hours:**
    *   The user has completely consumed their included "core hours." They have used "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used."
    *   A full red progress bar visually reinforces that this quota has been maxed out.
    *   The cost for this usage is currently "$0.00," implying they are still within the free tier for these included hours, but have hit their limit.
4.  **Resource Usage - Storage:**
    *   The user has utilized a small portion of their included storage. They have used "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used."
    *   A partially filled blue progress bar visually represents the low storage consumption relative to the limit.
    *   The cost for this storage is also currently "$0.00," indicating they are well within their free storage allowance.
5.  **Cost:** For both usage hours and storage, the current cost displayed is "$0.00," suggesting the user has not exceeded their free/included quotas in a way that would incur charges *yet*. However, hitting the usage hour limit could impact their ability to start new codespaces or extend existing ones until the quota resets, unless they choose to pay for additional usage.
6.  **Expandable Sections:** The right-pointing chevron ( `>` ) next to "Usage hours" and "Storage" suggests these sections might be expandable to show more detailed usage statistics or breakdown.

**Transcription of Text (Code/Commands/Error Messages):**

*   `Codespaces`
*   `Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation`
*   `Usage hours`
*   `120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used`
*   `$0.00`
*   `Storage`
*   `1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used`
*   `$0.00`*

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô to ‚ÄòDockerfile‚Äô in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, yesterday‚Äôs session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone‚Äôs guidance and support.

### Post #600 by **Vicky Kumar** (ds-students)
*February 16, 2025, 17:01 UTC*


> **Image Content:** *Here's a detailed analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

**1. Project Context:**
*   **Application Type:** Python FastAPI application.
*   **Project Name:** `ALGSOCH` (visible in the VS Code Explorer).
*   **Key Files:**
    *   `main.py`: The main FastAPI application file.
    *   `app/tasks.py`: Contains `run_task` function imported by `main.py`.
    *   `Dockerfile`: Indicates the project is intended to be containerized using Docker.
    *   `requirements.txt`: Likely lists Python dependencies.
*   **Environment:** Windows (judging by file paths like `c:\users\asus\appdata`). Python 3.13 is inferred from `python313` in the paths.

**2. Python Code (`main.py`):**
The `main.py` file defines a basic FastAPI application:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.tasks import run_task

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "LLM-based Automation Agent is Running"}

@app.post("/run")
```
*   It imports `FastAPI` and a `run_task` function from a local module.
*   It initializes a FastAPI app instance.
*   It defines a GET endpoint at the root (`/`) that returns a JSON message: `{"message": "LLM-based Automation Agent is Running"}`.
*   It shows a `@app.post("/run")` decorator, indicating a POST endpoint is being defined, but the function body for this endpoint is not visible.

**3. Terminal Output, Commands, and Errors:**

The terminal output shows a sequence of checks, attempts to fix issues, and a Docker build process.

*   **Initial Python Dependency Checks (Informational):**
    ```
    .0,!2.0.1,!2.1.0,<3.0.0,>=1.7.4->fastapi) (2.27.2)
    Requirement already satisfied: anyio<5,>=3.6.2 in c:\users\asus\appdata\local\programs\python\python313\lib\site-packages (from starlette<0.46.0,>=0.40.0->fastapi) (4.8.0)
    Requirement already satisfied: idna>=2.8 in c:\users\asus\appdata\local\programs\python\python313\lib\site-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.6.2->starlette<0.46.0,>=0.4
    0.0->fastapi) (3.10)
    Requirement already satisfied: sniffio>=1.1 in c:\users\asus\appdata\local\programs\python\python313\lib\site-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.6.2->starlette<0.46.0,>=0.
    40.0->fastapi) (1.3.1)
    ```
    *   These lines indicate that several common dependencies (like `anyio`, `idna`, `sniffio`) which are often sub-dependencies of `fastapi` or its components (like `starlette`) are already installed and satisfy the requirements.

*   **Pip Upgrade Notices:**
    ```
    [notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.2 -> 25.1
    [notice] To update, run: C:\Users\Asus\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
    *   These are notices suggesting an upgrade for the `pip` package manager itself.

*   **First Failed Command (Incorrect Pip Usage):**
    ```
    PS C:\algsocH\vickykumarLLM> pip install --upgrade python
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python (from versions: none)
    ```
    *   **Command:** `pip install --upgrade python`
    *   **Error Message:** `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python (from versions: none)`
    *   **Analysis:** The user attempted to install `python` using `pip`, which is incorrect as `python` is the interpreter itself, not a package installable via pip.

*   **Repeated Pip Upgrade Notices and Error:**
    ```
    [notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.2 -> 25.1
    [notice] To update, run: C:\Users\Asus\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for python
    ```
    *   This reiterates the pip upgrade notice and the error about "python" not being a found package.

*   **Python Execution Attempt and `ModuleNotFoundError` (Key Problem):**
    ```
    PS C:\algsocH\vickykumarLLM> python -u "c:\algsocH\vickykumarLLM\main.py"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "c:\algsocH\vickykumarLLM\main.py", line 1, in <module>
        from fastapi import FastAPI
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
    ```
    *   **Command:** `python -u "c:\algsocH\vickykumarLLM\main.py"`
    *   **Error Message:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`
    *   **Traceback:** Indicates the error occurred on line 1 of `main.py` (`from fastapi import FastAPI`).
    *   **Analysis:** This is the core issue ‚Äì the `fastapi` library is not installed in the Python environment being used to run `main.py`. This suggests the previous "Requirement already satisfied" messages might be from a different (or global) environment, or that `fastapi` itself was never installed, only its sub-dependencies checked.

*   **Docker Build Command and Output:**
    ```
    PS C:\algsocH\vickykumarLLM> docker build -t llm-agent .
    [+] Building 49.6s (1/2)
     => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
     => transferring dockerfile: 342B
     => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.10-slim
    ```
    *   **Command:** `docker build -t llm-agent .`
    *   **Output:** Shows the start of a Docker image build process.
        *   `llm-agent` is the tag being given to the new image.
        *   `.` indicates the Dockerfile is in the current directory.
        *   The build is currently at `(1/2)` stages.
        *   It's loading the Dockerfile definition and metadata for the base image `python:3.10-slim`.
    *   **Analysis:** The user appears to be attempting to containerize their application using Docker, which is a common way to manage dependencies and deploy Python applications, especially when facing `ModuleNotFoundError` issues in the host environment. The `49.6s` and subsequent `0.1s`, `0.1s`, `49.5s` values likely represent the time taken for different build steps.

**In Summary:** The user is struggling with dependency management for their FastAPI application. While their `main.py` code is visible, they are encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `fastapi` when trying to run it directly. They also made an incorrect attempt to install "python" via pip. To resolve the dependency issue, they have commendably initiated a Docker build, which will likely install `fastapi` and other required packages within the isolated Docker container environment as defined in their `Dockerfile`.*

1. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.
2. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain

I don‚Äôt think the project is too difficult to implement‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren‚Äôt very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task\_handler.py file of my repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.  
what to do

* push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images  
    
  how will this help?
* since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all  
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

i couldn‚Äôt my code space ran out of compute and then it was just lagging before i found out what happened , i just submitted old code repo and the image the we created in week 2 or week1 when had to create docker image for graded assignments  
EDIT:  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the **GitHub Codespaces usage and quota information** for a user, likely a student or participant in a data science course.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Key Information:

1.  **Platform and Context:**
    *   The primary service shown is **Codespaces**, which is GitHub's cloud-based development environment. This is a common platform used in online courses for providing pre-configured environments without requiring local setup.
    *   The message "Included quotas reset in 13 days" indicates that the user is operating under a free tier or an educational allowance, and these limits are refreshed on a monthly cycle. "See billing documentation" provides a link for more details on pricing and usage.

2.  **Usage Hours (Compute):**
    *   **Status:** The user has completely exhausted their included compute time.
    *   **Details:** "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used". This means the user has utilized all 120 free core hours allocated for the current billing period.
    *   **Visual Indicator:** The red progress bar is fully filled, reinforcing that the limit has been reached.
    *   **Cost:** "$0.00" currently, implying that these 120 hours were part of a free allowance and no charges have been incurred yet for usage *within* that quota. However, any further usage *before* the quota resets (in 13 days) or if billing is enabled, would likely incur charges.
    *   **Implication for a Data Science Course User:** This is the most critical piece of information. If a student sees this, they are likely experiencing issues launching new Codespaces, or their existing Codespaces might be automatically stopped or fail to start because they have used up their free compute allowance for the month. They will either need to wait 13 days for the quota to reset or, if allowed by the course, enable billing (which is generally discouraged for free course participation).

3.  **Storage:**
    *   **Status:** The user has consumed a very small portion of their allocated storage.
    *   **Details:** "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used". This shows that only 1.46 Gigabytes of the 15 GB-month included storage have been used.
    *   **Visual Indicator:** The blue progress bar is only barely filled.
    *   **Cost:** "$0.00", indicating no cost incurred for storage usage within the free limit.
    *   **Implication for a Data Science Course User:** Storage is clearly not the issue preventing them from working. They have ample storage remaining.

### Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

There are no code, command lines, or error messages present in this screenshot. The information displayed is purely a usage dashboard.*



  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the key information from the screenshot:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Context/Page Title:** The page is titled "Your codespaces," indicating that the user is on a platform or service that manages cloud-based development environments, commonly known as codespaces (e.g., GitHub Codespaces).
2.  **Action Buttons:** There are two prominent buttons in the top right:
    *   "Go to docs": Likely provides access to documentation or help resources.
    *   "New codespace": Allows the user to create a new development environment.
3.  **Critical Warning/Error Message:** The most prominent feature is a large, red-bordered box with an exclamation mark icon, signifying an important warning or error. This message directly addresses a billing or usage issue.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

The exact message appearing in the red warning box is:

"You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings."*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a GitHub Codespaces usage dashboard, providing an overview of a user's consumption against their included quotas.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Service:** The dashboard is for "Codespaces," which is GitHub's cloud-based development environment.
2.  **Quota Reset:** The included quotas for Codespaces usage will reset in **8 days**. A link to "See billing documentation" is provided for further details.
3.  **Usage Hours:**
    *   The user has consumed **180.00 of 180.00 included core hours**. This indicates that the entire free or included quota for compute time has been used up.
    *   A red progress bar is fully filled, visually reinforcing that the usage limit has been reached.
    *   The current cost for usage hours is **$0.00**, implying that the consumed hours are still within the included quota and no additional charges have been incurred yet.
4.  **Storage:**
    *   The user has used **9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month** of storage.
    *   A blue progress bar shows that roughly half of the included storage quota has been used.
    *   The current cost for storage is also **$0.00**, indicating that the usage is within the included limit.

**Implications for a Data Science Course Forum:**

Given this context, the screenshot likely pertains to a student in a data science course who is using GitHub Codespaces for assignments or projects. The most critical piece of information is that they have **exhausted their included usage hours**. This means that for the remaining 8 days of the current billing cycle, any further use of Codespaces that consumes core hours will likely incur charges, or they might be prevented from starting new codespaces if their account does not have billing set up for over-quota usage. This could be a common issue for students heavily using compute resources.

---

**Transcription (Code, Commands, Error Messages):**

There are no code snippets, commands, or explicit error messages present in this screenshot. The text visible constitutes UI labels and usage statistics.

*   `Codespaces`
*   `Included quotas reset in 8 days. See billing documentation`
*   `Usage hours`
*   `180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used`
*   `$0.00`
*   `Storage`
*   `9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month used`

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

The text describes the grading structure for two deliverables, identified as "P1" and "P2" (likely referring to projects or assignments). Each of these deliverables will be assessed based on two components:

1.  **Submissions:** This likely refers to the student's primary work submitted for P1 and P2.
2.  **Peer Reviews:** This indicates that a portion of the grade for P1 and P2 will come from reviewing the work of other students.

The relative importance of these components is clearly defined by a **weightage of 80:20**. This means that 80% of the grade for P1 and P2 will come from "Submissions," and the remaining 20% will come from "Peer Reviews."

**Transcribed Text:**

P1 and P2 will have two components - Submissions and peer reviews with weightage 80:20.*





> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be a segment of a calendar, schedule, or task list, most likely from a data science course forum or learning management system. It specifically pertains to "Peer Review Dates."

**Key Information:**

*   **Context:** The image shows a column or section dedicated to "Peer Review Date."
*   **Entries:** There are two distinct entries or states related to a peer review date:
    *   The first entry is a single hyphen (`-`), which commonly serves as a placeholder for "To Be Determined," "Not Applicable," or an unassigned date.
    *   The second entry provides a specific future date, indicating a scheduled peer review.
*   **Purpose:** This snippet likely informs students about upcoming deadlines or schedules for peer review assignments within the course. The hyphen suggests some peer reviews might still have unassigned dates, while others are clearly scheduled.

**Transcription (exactly as they appear):**

*Header:*

*Entry 1:*

*Entry 2:*

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382) and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) sir, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) for their support throughout this amazing experience.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows an API request being made using Postman (or a similar API client), and the resulting response, which includes an application-level error despite a successful HTTP status.

Here's the key information:

**1. Request Details:**
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/run?task=The file /data/dates.txt con...` (The full value of the `task` parameter is truncated in the URL bar, but visible in the "Params" section.)
*   **Query Parameters (under "Params" tab):**
    *   **Key:** `task`
    *   **Value:** `The file /data/dates.txt con...` (This suggests a prompt or instruction related to processing a file named `/data/dates.txt`).
*   **Active Tabs:** `Params` is active, indicating the query parameters are being inspected. `Headers (7)` shows 7 headers are being sent.

**2. Response Details:**
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK` (This indicates that the HTTP request itself was successfully received and processed by the server, even though the response body contains an error message, implying an issue at the application or API logic level, not the network level.)
*   **Response Time:** `1.83 s`
*   **Response Size:** `386 B`
*   **Response Body Format:** `JSON` (selected).

**3. Transcribed Code/Commands/Error Messages (from the JSON response body):**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid value: 'json'. Supported values are: 'json_object', 'json_schema', and 'text'.",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "param": "response_format.type",
    "code": "invalid_value"
  },
  "monthlyCost": 0.07081907999999999,
  "cost": 0,
  "monthlyRequ"
}
```

**4. Analysis of the Error:**
*   The error message `Invalid value: 'json'. Supported values are: 'json_object', 'json_schema', and 'text'.` strongly suggests that the client (Postman) might have specified `json` as a desired `response_format.type` (perhaps via a header or another parameter that's not directly visible in the `Params` tab), but the API does not support `json` as a value for that specific format type, instead expecting `json_object`, `json_schema`, or `text`.
*   The `param` field `response_format.type` confirms that the issue is with how the response format was specified or interpreted.
*   The `type` and `code` fields further classify it as an `invalid_request_error` with an `invalid_value`.

**5. Additional Information:**
*   The response also includes financial/usage metrics: `monthlyCost`, `cost`, and a truncated `monthlyRequ` (likely `monthlyRequests`). This indicates the API might be a paid service or tracks usage.
*   The `Postbot` overlay suggests that a feature or plugin for automated testing or AI assistance might be active in Postman (Ctrl+Alt+P shortcut).*

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‚Äòjson‚Äô

if you look at the ‚Äútype‚Äù key in your response\_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be ‚Äújson‚Äù

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‚Äòjson\_object‚Äô, ‚Äòjson\_schema‚Äô, and ‚Äòtext‚Äô

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‚Äòjson\_schema‚Äô

So therefore you should change

```
"type": "json"

```

to

```
"type": "json_schema"

```

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

<https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction>

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot appears to be from an automated grading or prerequisite checking system for a data science course project, likely "Project 1". It lists several checks related to Git/GitHub and Docker.

Here's the key information:

**Assessment Checks:**

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** FAIL
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS

**Overall Status:**

*   **Prerequisites:** FAIL
*   **Project 1 Score:** 0

**Additional Annotations:**

*   A large red circle highlights the first failing check: "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL".
*   The word "FAIL" under "Prerequisites" is underlined in red.
*   To the right of the "Is Dockerfile present..." line, there are red annotations that look like two question marks (??) and some small dots (...). These likely indicate confusion or a query from the student/user regarding the checks.

**Summary:**

The student has failed the prerequisites for Project 1, resulting in a score of 0. The primary reason for this failure is that a Docker image is either not present in Docker Hub, or if it is, it is not public. All other checks related to the GitHub repository (presence, public status, Dockerfile, and MIT license) have passed. The student has added annotations questioning the checks, particularly the Dockerfile one, despite it showing as "PASS".*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a fragment of a user interface, most likely from a platform for managing or sharing data science assets or repositories, such as GitHub, Kaggle, Hugging Face, or a similar version control or content hosting service commonly used in data science courses.

**Key Information:**

1.  **Tabular Data Presentation:** The image shows a table with three distinct columns:
    *   **Last Pushed:** This column indicates the timestamp of the last update or "push" made to the corresponding item. The upward arrow next to the header suggests the table is currently sorted by this column, likely showing the most recent updates first.
    *   **Contains:** This column describes the type of content held within the item.
    *   **Visibility:** This column specifies the access permissions for the item.

2.  **Specific Entries Displayed:**
    *   **Entry 1:**
        *   **Last Pushed:** "about 2 hours ago" (This value is underlined in red, indicating it's a point of interest). This suggests a very recent update to this specific item.
        *   **Contains:** "IMAGE" (appears as a label or tag). This indicates the item primarily contains or is an image file.
        *   **Visibility:** "Public" (This value is circled in red, highlighting its importance). This means the item is publicly accessible and not private.
    *   **Entry 2:**
        *   **Last Pushed:** "2 months ago"
        *   **Contains:** "IMAGE"
        *   **Visibility:** "Public"

3.  **User Focus:** The red annotations (underline on "about 2 hours ago" and circle on "Public") strongly suggest that the user who captured this screenshot is drawing attention to the recency of the first item's update and its public availability. This could be in the context of:
    *   Confirming a recent successful upload or update.
    *   Verifying that a shared resource is indeed publicly accessible.
    *   Asking a question related to the timing or privacy settings of a submitted or shared project/asset.

**Transcription of Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**

There are no code snippets, commands, or error messages present in this screenshot. The content consists solely of user interface labels and data values.*



***This docker image has outlived many students‚Äô hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.***

**Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?**  
What in the April Fools is this

> It hasn‚Äôt even been morning yet!

PS ( [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There‚Äôs something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

### Post #659 by **HARISH. S** (ds-students)
*April 01, 2025, 05:56 UTC*
yes sir same problem  



> **Image Content:** *Here's an analysis of the provided screenshot from a data science course forum:

**Key Information:**

1.  **Environment:** The user is operating within a terminal environment, specifically MINGW64 (likely Git Bash on Windows), which provides a Unix-like command-line interface. The prompt indicates the user is `hsent` on a desktop machine named `DESKTOP-89FBVHS`, and they are currently on the `main` branch of a Git repository.
2.  **User's Goal:** The user is attempting to navigate into a directory named `hello_world` and then inspect a file called `Dockerfile` within that directory. This suggests they are likely working on a Docker-related exercise or project.
3.  **Initial Problem:** The first attempt to list the `Dockerfile` (`ls -l Dockerfile`) failed. This was due to unexpected characters (`^[[200~`) appearing at the beginning of the command, which likely resulted from a copy-paste operation or a terminal emulation issue. The shell interpreted `$'\\\E[200~ls'` as the command name, leading to a "command not found" error.
4.  **Resolution:** The user correctly re-entered the command `ls -l Dockerfile` without the extraneous characters.
5.  **Successful Outcome:** The `Dockerfile` was successfully listed. The output shows that `Dockerfile` is a regular file with read/write permissions for the owner (`hsent`) and read-only permissions for the group and others. It has a size of 343 bytes and was last modified on February 16th at 18:50.
6.  **Final Action:** The user appears to have pressed `Ctrl+C` (`^C`) at an empty prompt, which typically aborts the current operation or input.

**Transcription:**

```
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~ (main)
$ cd hello_world
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)
$ ^[[200~ls -l Dockerfile
bash: $'\\\E[200~ls': command not found
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)
$ 
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)
$ ls -l Dockerfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 hsent 197609 343 Feb 16 18:50 Dockerfile
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)
$ ^C
```*



  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays the main page of a GitHub repository, `Harish018S/hello_world`, which is publicly accessible. This view is typical for navigating a project's files and recent activity within a data science or software development context.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

### Key Information:

*   **Repository Owner:** `Harish018S`
*   **Repository Name:** `hello_world`

*   **Current Branch:** `main` (selected)
*   **Branches:** `2 Branches` exist in the repository.
*   **Tags:** `0 Tags`
*   **Total Commits:** `4 Commits` have been made to this repository overall.
*   **Last Activity:** The most recent activity on the `main` branch was `2 months ago`.
*   **Latest Commit Message (for the directory):** `Create app.py`
*   **Latest Commit Hash (partial):** `ee31a25`
*   **Files in the Root Directory:**
    *   `LICENSE`: This file was created with the commit message `Create LICENSE` `2 months ago`.
    *   `README.md`: This file was part of the `Initial commit` `2 months ago`.
    *   `app.py`: This Python file was created with the commit message `Create app.py` `2 months ago`.
*   **README Content Snippet:** The visible `README` section indicates that the project is under an `MIT license`.
*   **Navigation & Actions:** Standard GitHub navigation tabs are visible (`Code`, `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Actions`, `Projects`, `Wiki`, `Security`, `Insights`, `Settings`). Buttons for `Pin`, `Unwatch 1`, `Go to file`, `Add file`, and `Code` (for cloning/downloading) are present.
*   **Search Bar:** A search bar is available with the prompt `Type / to search`.

### Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:

This screenshot does not display any direct code snippets, command-line outputs, or error messages. It primarily shows the file structure and commit history of a GitHub repository.

The only "code" reference is the filename:
*   `app.py`

And the partial commit hash:
*   `ee31a25`*



please check and say sir.



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Windows File Explorer window, providing insights into a data science or software development project setup.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Environment and Navigation:**
*   **Operating System:** Windows (evident from the UI elements like the taskbar, File Explorer).
*   **User and Current Directory:** The user is navigating within `C:\Users\hsent\hello_world`. This indicates that the user `hsent` is working on a project named `hello_world`.
*   **File Explorer Mode:** Dark mode is active.
*   **Navigation Pane:** Shows standard Windows quick access folders (Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos) and other user-created folders like `main`, `invoice new 1`, `Agent_ai`, and `grok`. The presence of `Linux` in the navigation pane suggests that Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) might be installed, which is common in data science workflows.

**2. Project Files and Structure:**
The `hello_world` directory contains 6 items, indicating a typical setup for a reproducible software/data science project.

*   **File Listing (Exact Transcription):**

| Name        | Date modified  | Type                  | Size |
| :---------- | :------------- | :-------------------- | :--- |
| .git        | 16-02-2025 18:38 | File folder           |      |
| app         | 16-02-2025 18:55 | Python Source File    | 1 KB |
| Dockerfile  | 16-02-2025 18:50 | File                  | 1 KB |
| LICENSE     | 16-02-2025 18:38 | File                  | 2 KB |
| README      | 16-02-2025 18:38 | Markdown Source File  | 1 KB |
| requirements| 16-02-2025 18:52 | Text Document         | 1 KB |

**3. Implied Technologies and Practices:**
*   **Version Control:** The presence of a `.git` folder indicates that the project is under Git version control, a fundamental practice for collaboration and tracking changes in data science and software development.
*   **Python Project:** The `app` file is identified as a "Python Source File," strongly suggesting this is a Python-based application or script. The `requirements` file (likely `requirements.txt`) further supports this, as it's typically used to list Python package dependencies.
*   **Containerization (Docker):** The `Dockerfile` is a critical piece of information. It signifies that the project is set up for containerization using Docker. This allows for creating isolated, reproducible environments, which is crucial for deploying data science models or applications consistently across different systems.
*   **Documentation and Licensing:** The `README` (Markdown Source File) suggests project documentation is in place, and the `LICENSE` file indicates the project's licensing terms.

**4. Metadata/Timestamps:**
*   **File Modification Dates:** Most files were modified on **February 16, 2025**, with times ranging from 18:38 to 18:55. This suggests the project was recently created or updated.
*   **Current System Date/Time:** The system clock shows **11:32 AM on April 1, 2025**. This confirms the files were created/modified in the past relative to the current system time.

**5. Visible Applications on Taskbar:**
The taskbar shows icons for Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Edge, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and a Terminal (likely Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell). VS Code and a Terminal are commonly used IDEs/tools for data science and programming.

**Summary:**
This screenshot depicts a well-structured, modern data science or software development project. It's a Python application (`app`, `requirements`) that leverages Git for version control (`.git`) and Docker for containerization and reproducible deployment (`Dockerfile`). It also includes standard project documentation (`README`, `LICENSE`). The user is working within a Windows environment, potentially utilizing WSL, and has common developer tools like VS Code readily available.*



sir it seems like there was a problem when i pushed this files to the repo but i defenitely did correctly. PLease allow me to add docker file alone with your permission. As you can see i haven‚Äôt opened the dockerfile since the last date of project 1. Kindly allow this sir. and i have MiT license in my repo but still showing fail . kindly check that also sir.

### Post #660 by **HARISH. S** (ds-students)
*April 01, 2025, 06:04 UTC*
yes sir same problem  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot shows a user interacting with a Git Bash (MINGW64) terminal on a Windows machine, likely in the context of a data science or DevOps course given the presence of a `Dockerfile`. The user attempts to list details of a `Dockerfile` but encounters a common pasting error before successfully executing the command.

---

### Key Information:

1.  **Environment:** The user `hsent` is operating on a Windows desktop named `DESKTOP-89FBVHS` using the MINGW64 terminal, which provides a Bash-like environment. The current directory is initially the home directory (`~`), and the user is on the `main` Git branch.
2.  **Navigation:** The user successfully navigates into a directory named `hello_world`.
3.  **Command Execution Issue:** An initial attempt to execute `ls -l Dockerfile` fails. The terminal interprets some control characters (`^[[200~`) as part of the command, leading to a "command not found" error. This often happens when pasting text into a terminal that supports bracketed paste mode, and the paste operation is somehow corrupted or misinterpreted.
4.  **Successful Command:** After the error, the user correctly re-enters and successfully executes `ls -l Dockerfile`.
5.  **File Details:** The output confirms the existence of a file named `Dockerfile` within the `hello_world` directory. Its details are:
    *   **Permissions:** `-rw-r--r--` (read/write for owner, read-only for group and others).
    *   **Owner:** `hsent`
    *   **Group:** `197609` (a numeric GID).
    *   **Size:** `343` bytes.
    *   **Last Modified:** `Feb 16 18:50`.
6.  **Session End:** The session snippet ends with the user entering `^C` (Ctrl+C), which typically interrupts a running process or clears the current input line.

---

### Transcribed Code, Commands, and Error Messages:

```bash
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~ (main)
$ cd hello_world
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)
$ ^[[200~ls -l Dockerfile
bash: $'\E[200~ls': command not found
hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)

> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays a Windows File Explorer window, showcasing the file structure of a project named `hello_world`. This setup is highly indicative of a Python-based software development or data science project, likely intended for deployment or sharing, given the presence of specific files.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. File System & Current Location:**
*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (indicated by the UI and taskbar).
*   **Current Directory:** `C:\Users\hsent\hello_world`. This is the project's root directory under a user named "hsent".
*   **Navigation Pane:** Shows standard Windows folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.), along with user-pinned folders like `main`, `invoice new 1`, `Agent_ai`, and `grok`. The presence of "Linux" under "This PC" suggests the user might be utilizing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for a Linux development environment.
*   **Total Items:** "6 items" are listed in the `hello_world` directory.

**2. Project Contents & Their Significance (within a Data Science/Software Context):**
*   **`.git` (File folder):** This indicates that the `hello_world` directory is a Git repository. This is a fundamental practice for version control in any software development or data science project, allowing tracking changes, collaboration, and easy rollback.
*   **`app` (Python Source File):** This is likely the main application script written in Python. In a data science context, this could be a Flask/Streamlit application, a FastAPI endpoint, or the core script running a machine learning model. Its small size (1 KB) suggests it's a basic "hello world" example.
*   **`Dockerfile` (File):** **This is a crucial indicator.** The presence of a `Dockerfile` means the project is set up for Docker containerization. This is highly relevant for:
    *   **Reproducibility:** Ensuring the application runs consistently across different environments.
    *   **Deployment:** Packaging the application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit.
    *   **MLOps:** A common practice for deploying machine learning models or data pipelines.
*   **`LICENSE` (File):** A standard file defining the legal terms under which the software can be used and distributed. Common in open-source projects.
*   **`README` (Markdown Source File):** This file (likely `README.md`) is used for project documentation, providing a summary, instructions for setup, usage, and other important information. Essential for anyone interacting with the project.
*   **`requirements` (Text Document):** **Another crucial file.** While the extension is `.txt`, this is almost certainly `requirements.txt`. This file lists all the Python package dependencies required for the `app` to run correctly. It's essential for creating a reproducible environment (e.g., using `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

**3. User Environment & Tools:**
*   **Taskbar Icons (from left to right):**
    *   Dell SupportAssist
    *   Windows Start Menu
    *   Search
    *   File Explorer (currently active)
    *   Microsoft Teams
    *   Microsoft Edge
    *   **Visual Studio Code (active, with 1 notification):** A very popular code editor, widely used for Python and data science development. The notification suggests an active session or pending update/message.
    *   **Windows Terminal/Command Prompt (active):** Indicates that the user is likely running commands, possibly for Git, Docker, or Python scripts.
    *   Other icons (possibly Docker Desktop, Azure Data Studio, etc. - hard to discern clearly).
*   **Date and Time:** 11:32 AM, 01-04-2025. The date is in the future relative to the current date, which might be a system setting discrepancy or a mock setup.
*   **Language:** ENG IN (English - India).

**4. Overall Context for a Data Science Course Forum:**
This screenshot strongly suggests a user is working on a foundational project (implied by "hello_world") that incorporates several best practices for modern software development and MLOps:
*   **Version control (Git)**
*   **Dependency management (`requirements.txt`)**
*   **Containerization (Dockerfile)**
*   **Standard project documentation (`README`, `LICENSE`)**
*   **Python as the primary language**
The user might be demonstrating a completed initial setup, asking for help with one of these components (e.g., "My Dockerfile isn't working," or "How do I run this app?"), or showing their progress in a course module that covers these topics.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages:**
There are **no explicit code snippets, command-line outputs, or error messages** visible within the screenshot. The information provided is solely about the file structure and properties within the File Explorer GUI.*

*April 01, 2025, 16:52 UTC*
same issue with me , my repo has both the dockerfile , license and is public. Please look into this . [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir . [GitHub - veershah1231/tds\_proj\_1: Tds project](https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1) and i have made them 2 months ago and is not a new commit.  



> **Image Content:** *This screenshot displays an automated or semi-automated feedback message from a data science course system to a student regarding their "Project 1" submission.

**Key Information:**

*   **Sender & Context:** The message is from "22t1 se2002" (likely a course code or system identifier) and was sent at 1:27 AM. It's addressed "to me" (the student).
*   **Purpose:** The message details the prerequisite checks for "Project 1" and provides the student's evaluation results for these checks. Failure to pass these prerequisites results in the submission not being evaluated and receiving a score of 0.
*   **Project 1 Prerequisites:** There are five specific requirements:
    1.  GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible.
    2.  GitHub repository must contain a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
    3.  GitHub repository must contain a valid `Dockerfile`.
    4.  A Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via `podman run` with specific environment variables and port mapping.
    5.  The Docker image must be built from the same `Dockerfile` as in the GitHub repository.
*   **Student's Evaluation Results:**
    *   **Docker image:** The Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public (`PASS`).
    *   **GitHub Repository:** The GitHub repository is **not** present or not public (`FAIL`).
    *   **Dockerfile:** A `Dockerfile` is **not** present in the root of the GitHub repository (`FAIL`).
    *   **MIT License:** An MIT `LICENSE` file is **not** present at the root of the GitHub repository (`FAIL`).
*   **Overall Outcome:** Due to multiple prerequisite failures, the student's "Project 1" is marked as `Prerequisites: FAIL`, resulting in a `Project 1 Score: 0`. The project itself was not evaluated beyond these initial checks.

**Transcribed Code, Commands, or Error Messages (Exactly as they appear):**

**Command Example:**
```
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
```

**Evaluation Results / Error Messages (implicit failures):**
*   `Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS`
*   `Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL`
*   `Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL`
*   `Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL`
*   `Prerequisites: FAIL`
*   `Project 1 Score: 0`*
