Please post any questions related to [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at [tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip ¬∑ sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don‚Äôt rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
   * Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
   * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

> **Image:** The screenshot provides instructions to install and run `uv` (if needed), followed by executing a Python script `datagen.py` from a specific GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`. The script should be run with `${user.email}` as the single argument, indicating that it likely requires a user's email address for data generation. The "NOTE" clarifies that this script is crucial for generating the data files required for subsequent tasks in the course. There are no error messages or data visualizations present.



  
sir [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

Hi Guddu ,

I didn‚Äôt make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir‚Äôs proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase ‚Äúrecent log file‚Äù, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

For more information watch this video <https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat> or watch TDS Live Sessions.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  



> **Image:** The screenshot outlines the deliverables for a data science project. The key steps involve creating a GitHub repository with an MIT LICENSE, writing code to interact with a local API via `POST /run?task=...` and `GET /read?path=...`, and building/publishing a Docker image. The image must be accessible via `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` serving the API at  `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`. The submission requires links to the GitHub repository and the Docker image. Instructions emphasize using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, and using GPT-4o-Mini with short prompts.



Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a UI element from a data science course forum related to "Project 1". A question asks: "1) I have seen Project 1 available at this link and have attempted it". A radio button labelled "Yes" provides a binary response option. The UI also features a clickable link, presumably leading to project details. The student is interacting with the project assignment through a checklist-style interface.





> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot displays the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" assignment from a "Tools in Data Science" course. The project involves using a Large Language Model (LLM) for a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to process logs, ticket systems, and source code at the company "DataWorks Solutions". Key UI elements include a navigation sidebar with course modules like "Development Tools", "Deployment Tools", "Large Language Models", and the breakdown of "Project 1", which includes "Background", "Create an API", "Phase A/B", and "Deliverables". The assignment due date is specified as "15 Feb 2025 EOD IST", and results will be announced by "25 Feb 2025."

Hi [@23f2005325](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2005325) ,

Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

In Tuesday‚Äôs(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
2. Pull an existing docker image.
3. Run that image inside a container.
4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
5. Once done you can commit it.
6. And push customized container‚Äôs image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it‚Äôs a good idea, we will see if it‚Äôs possible to discuss in session.

It instructs users to test API endpoints "POST /run?task=..." and "GET /read?path=..." and provides a command `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` for running the image. Finally, it requests submission of the GitHub repository URL (https://github.com/user-name/repo-name) and Docker image name (user-name/repo-name) via a Google Form. The command ensures the API automatically serves on http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and http://localhost:8000/read?path=....



Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.  



> **Image:** The screenshot outlines prerequisites for repository evaluation in a data science course. It specifies the repository must be publicly accessible on GitHub and contain a LICENSE file with the MIT license. A valid Dockerfile is also required. The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run using the command: `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`. Finally, the Docker image must use the same Dockerfile present in the GitHub repository.



We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?  



> **Image:** The screenshot describes a task (A6) from a data science course, requiring the student to find all Markdown (.md) files within the `/data/docs/` directory. For each file, the first header line (starting with '#') must be extracted. The goal is to create an index file, specifically `/data/docs/index.json`, which maps the filename (without path) to its corresponding header title. The expected JSON structure is illustrated with an example, showing a mapping from `"README.md"` to `"Home"` and `"large-language-models.md"` to `"Large Language Models"`.

no crewai, it takes really long i put time out for 300 secs(in run(task:str) in evaluate.py) still sometimes its not enough. I‚Äôll try with autogen next and then langchain

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic ‚Äúls‚Äù command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y‚Äôall run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn‚Äôt know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I‚Äôm struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I‚Äôm confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don‚Äôt know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone, [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that‚Äôs already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like ‚Äúpath=/data/format.md‚Äù or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like ‚Äúpath=show the data in format.md‚Äù?
3. Are we concerned about what‚Äôs shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they‚Äôre flexible? Ex. ‚ÄúCount the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt‚Äù

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:  
"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.

Hi Dewang,



> **Image:** Here's a concise analysis of the screenshot:

The screenshot is from a data science course forum, specifically the "Deliverables" section of "Project 1". It outlines the steps to complete a project, including creating a GitHub repository, a Dockerfile, and running a Docker image with specific API calls like `POST /run?task=...` and `GET /read?path=...` on `http://localhost:8000/`.  It instructs the user to submit their GitHub repository URL and Docker image name to a Google Form. The instructions emphasize using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and avoiding committing the token to the repository. The available AI proxy is limited to "GPT-4o-Mini".



Please *read* the Project page Deliverables carefully as well as the Evaluation Pre - Requisites.

Kind regards

[@21f3002390](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/21f3002390) - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won‚Äôt happen in the future anyway.

**What‚Äôs happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5) by removing this. I‚Äôll introduce caching later if required.

For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesn‚Äôt seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the output of a task involving extracting a credit card number from an image using an LLM and writing it to a text file. A POST request to `/run` specifies the task: extract number from `/data/credit_card.png` and save it to `/data/credit-card.txt`. The HTTP response indicates success (HTTP 200). A subsequent GET request retrieves the content of `/data/credit-card.txt`, revealing a discrepancy between the expected and actual extracted credit card number, the actual result is missing two digits.

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

how to handle this error  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal output where a Python script `evaluate.py` is being executed using `uv run` with environment variables set. The execution resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datagen'`. The traceback indicates the error occurs in `/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py` at line 20, where the script attempts to import from a module named 'datagen'. This suggests the 'datagen' module is either not installed, not in the Python path, or misspelled in the import statement.  The user is in the `/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_Project` directory.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?

Some questions about ‚ÄòB‚Äô group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
B7. Compress or resize an image  
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file  
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML  
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to match every single detail in that even " and ‚Äô .  
in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.  
llm will only handle -calling function based on query and parameter . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.

If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn‚Äôt a single full-fledged project session. It‚Äôs a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion.

We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382) [@23f2000237](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f2000237)) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards

Hi Aindree,

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was *updated* on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Hi

This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.

I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as ‚Äúcount\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt‚Äù I am unable to get a response.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows an API response with a "Code" of 200 and "Details" indicating the "Response body." The response body is a JSON object containing a single key-value pair: `"error": "Could not understand the task"`.  This indicates that the server successfully received the request (200 status), but it was unable to process it due to an issue with understanding the task's input.  The key error message for debugging purposes is `"Could not understand the task"`. The user likely needs to reformulate their request.



  
Please advice. Thank you.

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Kind regards

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

* **<https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>**

The user needs to adjust their usage to avoid exceeding this limit.

I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.

Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a data science course webpage about Large Language Models (LLMs). It informs users that LLMs "incur a cost" and provides specific API keys to iitm.ac.in email users, mentioning models like "gpt-4o-mini" and "text-embedding-3-small". Crucially, the page states, "Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month." The instructions explain how to replace the default OpenAI API endpoint "https://api.openai.com/..." with "https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/..." and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, presumably to use the AI Proxy instead of OpenAI directly.



In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards

Thanks for your response, [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton). It seems I won‚Äôt be able to proceed with the project until this issue is resolved. Also, I haven‚Äôt used LLM so much until February 7th to cost $2.

Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that request cost. So you can track your usage.

I‚Äôm aware of that. I‚Äôve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven‚Äôt been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I‚Äôll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost?

> **Image:** The user is running a Python script named `datagen.py` obtained from a remote URL using the command `uv run`.  The script encounters a `PermissionError` while attempting to create a directory named `/data` using `os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)`. The traceback indicates the error originates from the Python standard library's `makedirs` function. The error message "Permission denied: '/data'" suggests the user lacks the necessary permissions to create the directory in the root filesystem. The code tries to create this directory in `/tmp/datagen2eQ208.py` on line 284.

NEED HELP. CAN SOMEONE CONTACT OLLAMA AND ASK THEM TO CHECK THEIR CODE ITS HAS SOME SILLY MISTAKES IN CODE EXAMPLES. I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

[LINK TO PAGE WITH CODE EXAMPLE](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models)



> **Image:** The screenshot shows Python code snippets for storing and retrieving documents in a vector embedding database using `ollama.embed` and a `collection` object. The code first stores documents in the database by iterating through them, generating embeddings with `ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input=d)`, and adding them to the `collection` along with corresponding IDs and documents. To retrieve documents, the code takes an example prompt ("What animals are llamas related to?"), generates an embedding, then queries the `collection` for the most relevant document using `collection.query(query_embeddings=[response["embedding"]], n_results=1)`. The retrieved document's content is then extracted with `data = results['documents'][0][0]`.



  
  
  
  
correct code in step 2 collection query step

```
response = ollama.embed(
  model="nomic-embed-text:latest",
  input=task
)
results = collection.query(
  query_embeddings=response["embeddings"], #here embeddings and also not list of list as response embeddings already gives correct format
  n_results=1
)
data = results['documents'][0][0]

```

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj),

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>
    os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

```

If i can‚Äôt automate this process, i don‚Äôt see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - \* **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors ([@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton), [@iamprasna](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/iamprasna)):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

Kind regards

hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
for A2 i am getting this particular error and i don‚Äôt know what i am doing wrong in this  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a task failing due to incorrect formatting of a markdown file using Prettier. A POST request to `http://localhost:8000/run` attempts to format `/data/format.md` with prettier version 3.4.2. A GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` retrieves the file's content. The "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections indicate a discrepancy, with the result displaying "#Unformatted Markdown" along with the raw content of the file, suggesting prettier failed to format the markdown as intended.

you mean screenshot of evaluate.py file?  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows Python code, specifically two asynchronous functions named `a2` and `a3`. Function `a2` formats a file using `prettier@3.4.2` executed via `subprocess.run`. The arguments passed to `subprocess.run` include `npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath <file>`. It then compares the formatted result with the original and returns a "mismatch" if different. Function `a3` calls `get_dates(email)`. The bottom of the screen shows tabs for "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", and "TERMINAL."

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don‚Äôt know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

Go through the week 1-3 assignments once, you would be good to go with Phase A tasks.

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!

Just python and uv

More like 128mb image.

Please watch Tues week 5 session 1

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space‚Ä¶will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation‚Ä¶

Sir in main.py file I‚Äôm defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I‚Äôm testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I‚Äôm testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.  
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.

Hi instructors and TAs,  
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don‚Äôt have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

* Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query‚Äôs response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,  
Trebhuvan

Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve *all tasks using the same function* !

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Earlier when I asked this:

I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers.

Hi [@Rishabh2](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/rishabh2)

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that‚Äôs an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

Hi [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382)  
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used.

Things to be checked at your end.  
1. `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine  
2. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Kind regards.

I think there was something wrong with the way the code was getting inputs (keys). I just rewrote that part and it worked

Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a command-line instruction using `podman run`. The command includes environment variable setting (`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`) and port mapping (`-p 8000:8000`). The goal is to ensure that the running image serves an API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`. The user is likely setting up a containerized application with specific environment configurations and port forwarding for API access. The variables `$IMAGE_NAME` and `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` should be replaced by their values before executing the command.



The command:  
`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

gives the error:  
`crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found`

However the correct command seems to be:  
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

This works totally fine.



> **Image:** The screenshot captures the execution of a `podman run` command in a terminal. The command includes setting an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and port mapping `8000:8000`. The subsequent output shows the Uvicorn server starting up, indicating a successful application deployment. The log messages display "Started server process [1]", "Waiting for application startup.", and finally "Application startup complete." The Uvicorn server is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

One final question [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) , will our projects be evaluated with our `AIPROXY_TOKEN` or a different one.

Because my project is done but for evaluation if my `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is used, it might be out of credits.

[@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir I get this error  
but my app.py is able to get the server running on localhost and not on 0.0.0.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal within a data science course environment, likely using `podman` to run a container. The command executed is `podman run 20511982f949`.  The traceback indicates a `ModuleNotFoundError` specifically stating `"No module named 'fastapi'"`. The error originates from line 1 of the `/app/app.py` file, where it attempts to `import fastapi`. This suggests the FastAPI library is not installed within the container's environment.

When I am downloading the data folder after processing datagen.py , it is trying to download in root folder and it is facing permission error . how can we overcome this ?  
needs sudo permission all the time‚Ä¶

The `ls /` command is then executed to list the contents of the root directory. The output of `ls /` shows standard Linux directories like `bin`, `boot`, `etc`, `tmp`, and `usr`.

Hello Sir [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj)  
What are implications on missing the project 1.  
Due to some personal reasons I wasn‚Äôt able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.  
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you

The problem is:

1. I haven‚Äôt set any password for podman earlier.
2. Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).  
   what should I am supposed to do‚Ä¶

Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my ‚Äúapp.py‚Äù is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.  
Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py  
Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

The slide features abstract icons related to data science concepts, including a bar chart, a pie chart, a scatter plot, a computer screen, and connected nodes representing neural networks. These graphics visually represent the learning topics covered in this session. The overall theme appears to be an introduction to data analysis and visualization, possibly within a specific data science module. The content is designed to introduce the session's focus rather than addressing a specific technical problem.

* **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it

They are almost similar and it‚Äôs getting confusing in both cases, it‚Äôs given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?

Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

Two solutions

1. give proper permissions.
2. use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach

For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

Hi,  
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) ,  
In task A6  
**Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).**

Here expected output JSON ‚Äúkey‚Äù is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when ‚Äúpath/to/large-language-models.md‚Äù is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is ‚Äúpath/to/large-language-models.md‚Äù.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.  
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file should be folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file as key.

Sir, my token limit has crossed the $1 limit. Will I receive new limit or a fresh token ? I still need to complete my project.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays the pricing page for OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models, accessible via the URL `openai.com/api/pricing/`. It compares the costs for input, cached input, and output tokens for each model. Specifically, GPT-4o input costs "$2.50 / 1M tokens" and output costs "$10.00 / 1M tokens," while GPT-4o mini input costs "$0.150 / 1M tokens" and output costs "$0.600 / 1M tokens." Both models are advertised to have a 128k context length. The "Log in" button suggests this page is for users accessing paid services.

You can continue to $2. Then you would need to ask for a new token.

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the ‚Äú#‚Äù symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.  
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

''from datagen import (

Or it should be the part of the automation only‚Ä¶

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows Python code and terminal output, indicating a problem with a formatting script. The `handle_task_A2` function attempts to format a file using Prettier via `subprocess.run(["npx", f"prettier@{prettier_version}", "--write", file_path])`.  The terminal output in the "TERMINAL" tab shows that the expected and the result outputs on the "/data/format.md" file have the same, "Unformatted Markdown" text.  It means the formatting did not change anything in the file. The issue is likely that Prettier is not formatting the file as expected.

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‚Äò#‚Äô and change it to ‚Äònumber‚Äô and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‚Äòcount the # of‚Äô in a task, please interpret it as ‚Äòcount the number of‚Äô. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays

> **Image:** The code attempts to download and execute a Python script named "datagen.py" using the `subprocess` module. An error occurs because the `subprocess` module was not correctly imported or is not in scope when attempting to run the `llm.py` script. The traceback in the "TERMINAL" tab shows a "NameError: name 'subprocess' is not defined" originating from line 15 of "llm.py", where `subprocess.run` is called. The script first downloads 'datagen.py' and then executes it with an email as an argument. The main issue is that after downloading and running the external script in line 15, it throws a NameError.

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

sir i am getting this error by running the docker image  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python traceback indicating a `ModuleNotFoundError`. Specifically, the error message "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'" reveals that the `fastapi` library is not installed in the environment. The code `from fastapi import FastAPI` in the file `/app/app.py` at line 11 attempts to import the FastAPI class, but fails because the module isn't found. This suggests the user needs to install the `fastapi` package, likely using `pip install fastapi`.

Hey [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,  
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

These files are inside a separate folder - `evaluation` in my project root directory. Since I already submitted please do consider.

The Dockerfile defines a Python 3.12 environment, installs `uv` using a shell script downloaded from `astral.sh`, and then copies application files.  It also sets the working directory to `/app` and ensures the uv binary is on the PATH. Finally, the `CMD` is set to `["uv", "run", "app.py"]`.

i think you have to run the following command

try to include --root ./data in your code

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.  
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

The second section requires a DockerHub image name in the format "user-name/image-name".

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a JSON object containing a message indicating an expense exceeding a limit. The "message" field states: "On 2025-02 you used $2.0037491399999996, exceeding $2". This suggests a potential issue with floating-point precision causing a value slightly above $2 to be flagged as exceeding the limit. The problem likely lies in how the application handles decimal numbers or how the limit is checked, rather than an actual overspending issue. There are no apparent UI elements or visualizations visible, just the raw JSON response.

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)  
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.  
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.  
create a venv using python3 -m venv name\_of\_venv  
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location  
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.  
It even happened for me



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal session where a user "jaideep@archlinux" is attempting to install the "numpy" package using `pip3 install numpy`.  The first attempt results in an "error: externally-managed-environment," indicating system-wide Python package management conflicts.  The system suggests using `pacman` or creating a virtual environment. The user activates a python3 virtual environment located at `/home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate` and attempts the `pip3 install numpy` again, and this time the output "Requirement already satisfied: numpy" shows that the package is already installed in the virtual environment.

This is where I have been facing the issue.

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Google Meet screen with a participant named "TELVIN VARGHESE," who is currently not sharing video. Their default profile image consists of the letter "T" within an orange circle, indicating that either the participant's camera is off or there is a problem with the video feed being displayed. There are no visible code snippets, error messages, data visualizations, or textual content related to specific technical issues related to data science, other than that the student may be having an issue with their Google Meet video feed.

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

On bash it gives below output. On PowerShell it says missing authorization. A9 is failed.



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal session where the user executes a `curl` command to interact with an OpenAI embeddings endpoint. The command sends a POST request to `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` with the `text-embedding-3-small` model and an input list containing "king" and "queen". The response, printed to the terminal, is a JSON object containing a "list" of embeddings, with each embedding being a list of floating-point numbers.  The terminal output also displays connection statistics, showing upload and download progress.  The `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable is set before executing the `curl` command, likely for authentication.



In PowerShell  



> **Image:** The user is attempting to make a POST request to `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embedding` using `curl` in PowerShell. The request includes JSON data specifying the model "text-embedding-3-small" and the input array ["king", "queen"]. An error message is returned: `"message": "Missing Authorization: Bearer header. See https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy"`. The problem is likely related to the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` variable not being properly set or the authorization header not being correctly formatted.  The UI shows the PowerShell console with the curl command and the returned JSON error.

My data is getting generated -  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON response from a local server running at `127.0.0.1:8000`. The request URL is `run?task=Install%20`. The JSON contains a "files" key with a list of file names (e.g., "comments.txt", "contacts.json") and a "message" key stating "Data generation complete". The UI element "Pretty-print" is visible, likely controlling JSON formatting. The response indicates a task possibly related to installation or data generation completed successfully.



  
despite this I am getting an error when evaluating the file with no explanation of the error. Can someone please help with this.  
Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a `format.md` file open in a code editor, likely VS Code based on the UI.  The file contains a mix of Markdown and Python code. The Markdown portion includes a title "#Unformatted Markdown", a paragraph with extra spaces, and bulleted list with '-', '+', and '*' characters.  The Python code block, introduced by "```py", contains a single line: `print("user@example.com")`. There are no error messages visible.



  
Even the markdown file shows the correct email. What are the possible issues that I could be facing with this one.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

1. in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
2. When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

facing the issue on submission  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a data science assignment submission form with validation errors.  The first question requests a GitHub repository link formatted as "https://github.com/user-name/repository-name," and the user has provided "https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Ja". The second question asks for the DockerHub image name in "user-name/image-name" format. The input "rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25" triggers a validation error, indicated by a warning icon and the message "Must match pattern".

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Python error related to OpenAI API key configuration. The error message "openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable" indicates that the OpenAI client is being initialized without an API key. The problematic line in the code is `client = OpenAI()`, found in `/app/app.py` at line 35. The error originates from the `openai/_client.py` file during the `__init__` function call, specifically line 110. The user needs to either explicitly pass the `api_key` during client initialization or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

for the datagen script is it ok to hardcode the scripts url and my email id? I understand the script itself may change but can I count on the link remaining the same? Also is it necessary to pass the email as argument?

Blunder in your `main.py`.  
You are using API\_KEY = os.getenv(‚ÄúAI\_PROXY\_TOKEN‚Äù) but it should be AIPROXY\_TOKEN.

What we expect in project.

1. server running inside docker container at 8000.
2. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

> **Image:** The user is attempting to build a Docker image using the command `docker build -t pratik007thala/automation-agent`. The Dockerfile's first line `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm` is causing an error. The error message "failed to solve: python:3.12-slim-bookworm: failed to resolve source metadata" indicates an issue resolving the base image.

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN interference)

try to debug it with help of chatgpt.

You can also use codespaces for trying another network.

> **Image:** The screenshot displays a project structure within a code editor, likely VS Code.  The project, named "TDS-Project-1," contains subdirectories like "app" and "data," with Python files such as "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "main.py", and "funtion_tasks.py" and the file "task_to_embed.txt". "datagen.py" and "evaluate.py" have a "U" indicator next to them along with numbers, possibly indicating untracked or updated files within a version control system (likely Git). The presence of ".gitignore" and "Dockerfile" suggests the project utilizes Git for version control and containerization.

No don‚Äôt do that, just follow the procedure.  
Two problems with keeping token in file.

1. It will become public after you push to github.
2. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a JSON response from an API, indicating an authentication error. The error detail states: `"Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}"`.  This suggests the authentication token being used is not trusted by the API. The UI includes tabs for "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs," and a "Copy" button to copy the JSON. The error occurs in the "Response" section of the API call.

On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.

evaluate.py:  
A2 failed: Command ‚Äò[‚Äònpx‚Äô, ‚Äòprettier@3.4.2‚Äô, ‚Äò‚Äìstdin-filepath‚Äô, ‚Äòdata/format.md‚Äô]‚Äô returned non-zero exit status 2.

bash:  
npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md

bash works as expected. Can someone help?

Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

the error that comes is :

## Dockerfile:2

## 1 | # Use a lightweight Python image 2 | >>> FROM python:3.12-slim 3 | 4 | # Set the working directory in the container

ERROR: failed to solve: python:3.12-slim: failed to resolve source metadata for [Docker Hub Container Image Library | App Containerization](http://docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim:) failed to copy: httpReadSeeker: failed open: failed to do request: Get ‚Äú<https://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/registry-v2/docker/registry/v2/blobs/sha256/6f/6f3c6367c5a38963f84310cbb24dfcfbddab1dad40cff18afb8fe89098891f08/data?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=f1baa2dd9b876aeb89efebbfc9e5d5f4%2F20250215%2Fauto%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250215T192245Z&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ed37cf0c346e2ed440f29638ec43ce66640bdc7d285e7be7bf25c308c46fd6b1>‚Äù: dialing [docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443](http://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443) container via direct connection because static system has no HTTPS proxy: connecting to [docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443](http://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443): dial tcp: lookup [docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com](http://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com): no such host

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn‚Äôt work.  
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.

Aagman

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can‚Äôt understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.  
When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.

```
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH

Here‚Äôs how to prompt folks. Just do what [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) mentioned in today‚Äôs live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

Most people are still prompting wrong.
I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.
Here‚Äôs how it works: [pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1890492955842007087/photo/1)



> **Image:** This screenshot illustrates the anatomy of a prompt used for a data science model or LLM. The prompt begins by specifying the "Goal": to obtain a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco. Next, the "Return Format" requests the name of the hike (as it appears on AllTrails), addresses, distance, drive time, hike duration, and unique aspects. The prompt includes "Warnings" to ensure the trail name is correct, the trail actually exists, and the time is correct. Finally, a "Context Dump" provides further preferences, like hiking experience, desired novelty, and interests, to guide the model.

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is not a limit to the docker image size.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a browser window displaying the output of a task execution on a local server (127.0.0.1:8000). The URL indicates the task was an "Install uv" operation, possibly conditional based on URL encoding. The JSON response returned in the body, formatted using "Pretty-print", indicates the success of the operation: `"success": "Executed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py with email trial@gmail.com"`. The message confirms the execution of a Python script (`datagen.py`) from a GitHub repository with a specified email address. This suggests a successful installation or execution related to a data science task or project setup.



Im able to execute the query succesfully.  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a Windows file explorer window navigated to the "data" folder on the "Acer (C:)" drive. The folder contains various data-related files, including folders named "docs" and "logs", along with text files like "comments", "dates", and "email". There's also a "contacts" JSON file, a "credit_card" PNG image, a "format" markdown file, and a "ticket-sales" database file. The files' "Date modified" field all show the timestamp "16-02-2025 11:56" or "16-02-2025 11:58". The file types are clearly indicated along with their sizes.



But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder  
The datagen.py file is in the project folder itself.



> **Image:** The code snippet aims to ensure all data files are accessed from a 'data' folder within the project root. It defines `PROJECT_ROOT` using `os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())` to get the absolute path of the current working directory. Then, `DATA_DIR` is created by joining `PROJECT_ROOT` with the "data" string using `os.path.join()`. Finally, `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)` is called to create the 'data' directory if it doesn't exist. The `exist_ok=True` prevents an error if the directory already exists.



am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.

> **Image:** The Python code defines a function `run_datagen` that extracts a URL and email from a `task_description` using regular expressions. If either extraction fails, it returns an error: `"URL or email not found in the prompt."`. The function downloads a script from the extracted URL using the `requests` library and saves it to a file named "datagen.py".  It then checks if the "uv" package is installed, installing it using `pip` if it is not found. Finally, it executes the downloaded script with the extracted user email as an argument using `subprocess.run`.



  
I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive.

Sir earlier my code was running fine, but after the assigment of the new token,  
it is now showing 400 bad request, which simply implies there is something wrong with the token‚Ä¶  
plz do something sir‚Ä¶  


> **Image:** The screenshot shows log output indicating HTTP requests and their corresponding responses. A POST request to `/run` with a complex URL-encoded task description related to an SQLite database named "ticket-sales.db" receives a "400 Bad Request" error. The task seems to involve querying sales of "Gold" tickets. A subsequent GET request to `/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` results in a "404 Not Found" error, implying the requested file is missing. This likely means the prior database task failed to write the output file to the specified path, due to the "400 Bad Request" error.



I have do have cross verified the new token been correctly been assigned to the system variable‚Ä¶

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/` directory inside your project instead of C: drive

```
["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]

```

Also, you don‚Äôt need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which doesn‚Äôt exist in your system. I‚Äôll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer

### Generation-Based Automation Agent (No Hard Coding)

**Repository Link:** [GitHub - 23f2005593/tds](https://github.com/23f2005593/tds)

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.

If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

Please contribute to this repository. **We will win together.**

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it‚Äôs value to your API Key then try.

**Role:**  ds-students

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

```
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

```

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn‚Äôt include the `"data"` key.

### What I‚Äôve Tried

1. **Token Verification:**

* I‚Äôm using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.
* The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

```
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"

```

* I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

2. **API Request Details:**

* The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* The payload is set as:

json

Copy

```
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}

```

* Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

3. **Debug Output:**  
   Here‚Äôs a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

```
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
üî¥ A9 failed: 'data'

```

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.

### What I Suspect

* The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
* There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I‚Äôm not aware of.
* Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

### Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database‚Ä¶  
Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases‚Ä¶

**Role:**  ds-students

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1). But this gave me the following error:

```
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

```

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I‚Äôm not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .

It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.

In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.

What is expected repo structure ?  
I have a folder in my repo and dockerfile and license are present in that folder but I still received a mail regarding missing License and Dockerfile.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô to ‚ÄòDockerfile‚Äô in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) Sir, yesterday‚Äôs session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone‚Äôs guidance and support.

> **Image:** The screenshot shows a VS Code window with a Python FastAPI application. The `main.py` file contains imports like `from fastapi import FastAPI`. The terminal output reveals a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`, indicating that the FastAPI library is not installed in the current environment. The user attempted to install or upgrade Python itself using `pip install --upgrade python`, which resulted in the error "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python". The user also initiated a Docker build with `docker build -t 1lm-agent .`, which is in progress.

1. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.
2. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton)  
Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain

I don‚Äôt think the project is too difficult to implement‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren‚Äôt very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

[@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand)  
[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task\_handler.py file of my repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini) for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.

I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.

I have received a mail that my project has ""No ‚ÄúMIT‚Äù in LICENSE;No Dockerfile " which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there‚Ä¶ but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not. Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my project.

I noticed something quite funny. The project never specified the required tech stack, so one could have done this entirely with JavaScript as well, assuming the necessary libraries are installed.

[@TheVishal](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/thevishal)  
EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.  
what to do

* push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images  
    
  how will this help?
* since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all  
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

CHEERS

I didn‚Äôt submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,  
‚ÄúThe form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.‚Äù

I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.  
This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me.

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.

The project was a rollercoaster ride‚Äîespecially with all the errors that kept popping up‚Äîbut overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton), [@Saransh\_Saini](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/saransh_saini), and [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) sir for their guidance and support.

i couldn‚Äôt my code space ran out of compute and then it was just lagging before i found out what happened , i just submitted old code repo and the image the we created in week 2 or week1 when had to create docker image for graded assignments  
EDIT:  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays Codespaces usage and quotas. The "Usage hours" section shows "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used" accompanied by a red bar, indicating that the full quota has been consumed.  Storage usage is "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used," visualized with a blue bar showing partial usage.  Both "Usage hours" and "Storage" have a cost of "$0.00." The overall quota reset is indicated to be in 13 days, with a link to billing documentation.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a GitHub Codespaces interface where the user has exhausted their included usage for the current billing period. A red-bordered warning message states: "You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings." A link to "billing settings" is provided for further action. The UI also includes options like "Go to docs" and "New codespace." There are no code snippets or data visualizations visible.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows the Codespaces usage metrics. It highlights that "180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used", indicating complete utilization of the included core hours. Storage usage is "9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month used". The UI shows two horizontal bars visually representing the used vs total quota for "Usage hours" (red, full) and "Storage" (blue, about half full), respectively. A link "See billing documentation" is available.

[@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.



> **Image:** The image presents information about project grading criteria. Projects "P1 and P2 will have two components - Submissions and peer reviews". The weighting of submissions and peer reviews is specified as "80:20", meaning submissions are worth 80% and peer reviews are worth 20% of the final grade for each project. The context is potentially a grading policy or assignment specification within a data science course.





> **Image:** The screenshot displays a table showing "Peer Review Date" information. The first entry shows a date value of "-", indicating potentially missing or unavailable data for the first review. The second entry shows a specific date: "Tuesday, February 25, 2025". The table format suggests a dataset or log being displayed where peer review dates are tracked. The "-" might be a placeholder indicating incomplete reviews or data entry errors.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like [@23f1002382](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/23f1002382) and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - [@s.anand](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/s.anand) sir, [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) for their support throughout this amazing experience.

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‚Äòjson‚Äô

if you look at the ‚Äútype‚Äù key in your response\_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be ‚Äújson‚Äù

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‚Äòjson\_object‚Äô, ‚Äòjson\_schema‚Äô, and ‚Äòtext‚Äô

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‚Äòjson\_schema‚Äô

So therefore you should change

```
"type": "json"

```

to

```
"type": "json_schema"

```

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

<https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction>

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

Kind regards

> [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

Anyone having any idea on this?

No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned.

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.

If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.

Alright, [@Carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton). No problem at all, and thank you for your response.

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project‚Äôs LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns‚Äîthis has been a great learning experience.

And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: *‚ÄúGive loose marking for effort!‚Äù*‚Äîbecause, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!

I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)!

> **Image:** The screenshot displays the results of a series of checks related to a data science project.  The key issue is that the check "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL", indicating a problem with Docker image availability or public access on Docker Hub. Furthermore, "Prerequisites: FAIL" suggests other setup requirements are unmet, preventing the project from progressing. Despite this, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are all correctly present and publicly accessible, according to the checks, as it says "PASS". The project score is currently 0.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a repository listing with columns "Last Pushed", "Contains", and "Visibility".  The "Last Pushed" column shows timestamps like "about 2 hours ago" and "2 months ago", with an upward arrow indicating the list is sorted by this column.  Both repositories "Contain" an image, and the "Visibility" of both is set to "Public". A red circle is drawn around the value "Public" in the first row.



***This docker image has outlived many students‚Äô hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.***

**Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?**

PS ( [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/jivraj) ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There‚Äôs something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

yes sir same problem  



> **Image:** The user is in a bash terminal using MINGW64 and navigated to the "hello_world" directory using the `cd` command. They attempted to list the "Dockerfile" using `ls -l Dockerfile`. However, there was a previous command `$^[[200~1s -1 Dockerfile` which resulted in a "command not found" error. The subsequent correct `ls -l Dockerfile` command displays the file details, including permissions, owner, size, and modification date, indicating the file exists. The user then appears to be trying to terminate the session or a process with `^C`.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a GitHub repository named "hello_world" owned by user "Harish018S".  The repository contains files such as "LICENSE", "README.md", and "app.py". The UI shows that the repository has 2 branches, no tags, and the current branch is "main". The latest commit "Create app.py" by "Harish018S" was made 2 months ago with commit hash "ee31a25", and the repository has 4 commits in total. There is an "Add file" dropdown menu, and a green "<> Code" button is visible, providing actions related to code.



please check and say sir.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays a file explorer window for a "hello_world" project. The path is "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world". The directory contains common data science related files like `.git`, `app.py` (Python source file), `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` (Markdown source file) and `requirements.txt`. No error messages or data visualizations are visible in the image. The user is likely viewing the project structure.



sir it seems like there was a problem when i pushed this files to the repo but i defenitely did correctly. PLease allow me to add docker file alone with your permission. As you can see i haven‚Äôt opened the dockerfile since the last date of project 1. Kindly allow this sir. and i have MiT license in my repo but still showing fail . kindly check that also sir.

yes sir same problem  



> **Image:** The screenshot shows a terminal session in a MINGW64 environment. The user attempts to list a Dockerfile using `ls -l Dockerfile` but initially receives an error: "bash: $'\E[200~ls': command not found". This indicates a problem with the formatting or special characters in the command entered.  A subsequent `ls -l Dockerfile` command is successful, showing the file's permissions, owner, size, and modification date.  The final line suggests the user may have tried to abort a process with `^C`.



  



> **Image:** The screenshot depicts a GitHub repository named "hello_world" owned by user "Harish018S".  The UI shows the "Code" tab is active, displaying the repository's file structure under the main branch. Visible files include LICENSE, README.md, and app.py, each with a timestamp of "2 months ago". The most recent commit is "Create app.py" by "Harish018S" with commit hash "ee31a25" and is part of "4 Commits". The repository has "2 Branches" and "0 Tags".



please check and say sir.



> **Image:** The screenshot displays the contents of the "hello_world" directory located under "Users\hsent" on the C drive. The directory contains a '.git' folder, a Python source file named "app," a "Dockerfile," a "LICENSE" file, a "README" markdown file, and a "requirements" text document. No error messages or visual charts are present. The user interface is a standard Windows file explorer, suggesting a problem potentially related to file setup, dependencies, or code execution, but without a specific error, the issue is unclear.

same issue with me , my repo has both the dockerfile , license and is public. Please look into this . [@carlton](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton) sir . [GitHub - veershah1231/tds\_proj\_1: Tds project](https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1) and i have made them 2 months ago and is not a new commit.  



> **Image:** The email screenshot details Project 1 prerequisites and evaluation results. The student passed the Docker image check, but failed checks for GitHub repository presence/public accessibility, the presence of a `Dockerfile` in the repository root, and the presence of an MIT license. The evaluation message specifies that the project requires the repository to be public and to contain both a `Dockerfile` and an MIT License file in the root directory. The provided `podman run` command example includes environment variable and port mapping instructions. The overall project prerequisites are marked as "FAIL," resulting in a project score of 0.
